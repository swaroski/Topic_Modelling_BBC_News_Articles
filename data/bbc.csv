"Syria war: US warns of 'more' after missile strikes The US envoy to the UN has warned America may take further action after bombarding a Syrian air base suspected of using chemical weapons. Nikki Haley said her country would not stand by when chemical weapons were used, as it was in its ""vital interest"" to stop their proliferation. Syrian ally Russia accused the US of encouraging ""terrorists"" with its unilateral actions. Moscow has promised to strengthen its ally Syria's anti-aircraft defences.  It is also closing down a hotline with the US designed to avoid collisions between their air forces over Syria. At least six people are reported to have been killed in the US missile strikes early on Friday. US officials say the base was used to launch a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians on Tuesday. According to Idlib's opposition-run health authority, 89 people, including 33 children and 18 women, died in the suspected nerve agent attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. Syria denies using nerve gas. Ms Haley told an emergency session of the UN Security Council that America had acted to ensure Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would never use chemical weapons again. ""We are prepared to do more but we hope that will not be necessary,"" she said. ""It is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons."" She blamed Iran and Russia for standing by the Syrian government when it committed crimes. ""Strengthening Assad will only lead to more murders,"" she said.  Russia's deputy ambassador to the UN, Vladimir Safronkov, described the US strikes as ""illegitimate"". ""When you take your own path, this leads to horrible tragedies in the region,"" he told the Americans. UK ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the strikes were a ""proportionate response to unspeakable acts"". Cruise missiles fly low and have a relatively small radar cross-section so they are difficult to destroy with air defences. Russia may seek to improve Syria's surface-to-air missile system in the wake of this US attack but it would be very much a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Syria used to have a highly effective national air defence system based on Soviet-era radars and missiles but it has been significantly weakened in the wake of the civil war and the loss of territory by the regime. Look at the ease with which the Israelis carry out strikes against Hezbollah arms convoys and weapons stores in Syria.  Russia has some of its most modern surface-to-air missile systems at its air base in Syria and radars with a huge reach but, for whatever reason, they too have not deterred Israeli strikes.  Their presence makes air strikes by manned US aircraft unlikely and for Washington the Tomahawk cruise missile will remain the weapon of choice Two US Navy destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Shayrat airfield in western Homs province at about 04:40 Syrian time (01:40 GMT). They targeted aircraft, aircraft shelters, storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers and air defence systems at the Syrian government-controlled facility, according to the Pentagon. It said the base was used to store chemical weapons and that ""every precaution"" had been taken to avoid casualties. The Russian military was informed beforehand, the Pentagon said. Unnamed US intelligence sources have told media they believe Russian personnel were at Shayrat when Sarin, a nerve agent, was loaded on to a Syrian jet but they have not established whether the Russians knew it was happening. Retired civil servant Mateea Zefa, who lives near the base, went with his children to look at the base afterwards and found it ""totally destroyed"". ""We saw lots of bombs,"" he told the BBC by phone. ""Loads of them. It was a tough night. My house was damaged, almost all the windows broke and some walls cracked."" Houses on one side of the base were also ""totally destroyed"", he added. Some children and other people were injured by shards of breaking glass but no civilians were killed, another witness, Ammar al-Khedr, said. The dead and seriously injured were all soldiers, he said, adding that they had been brought to her hospital. The Syrian army said earlier there had been significant damage to the base.  However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition news service, said  on Friday evening the base was already back in operation and aircraft had taken off and ""struck targets near Palmyra"". The report could not be independently verified. The US has led a coalition carrying out air strikes against jihadist groups in Syria since 2014 but this is the first time it has targeted government forces. President Trump previously spoke out against US military involvement in Syria, instead calling for a greater focus on domestic interests.  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signalled a sudden shift in policy on Thursday, saying that Bashar al-Assad should have no role in a future Syria. Russia says it has formally notified the Pentagon that as of 21:00 GMT on Friday their air force hotline for Syrian airspace will close down. It also sent a frigate armed with cruise missiles, the Admiral Grigorovich, from the Black Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean on Friday, in what may be a routine move.

"Stockholm lorry rams crowds, killing 'at least four people' A lorry has smashed into a store in central Stockholm, killing at least four people.  At least a dozen people were also injured in the incident on Drottninggatan (Queen Street), one of the city's major pedestrian streets, on Friday afternoon. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said it was a terror attack. One man has been arrested, after police released a CCTV image of a person who may be connected to the case.  Eyewitnesses describe lorry 'trying to hit people' In a speech on Friday night, Mr Lofven said Swedish values of democracy and freedom would not be ""undermined by hatred"". He also announced the country's border controls had been strengthened. The crash happened at the Ahlens department store just before 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT). Witnesses say the lorry drove into the front window.  One eyewitness, Annevi Petersson, told the BBC she was in the shop's fitting room when she heard the screams. ""There was blood everywhere,"" she said. Swedish brewery Spendrups said its lorry had been stolen on its way to a restaurant delivery earlier in the day.  ""Someone jumped into the driver's cabin and drove off with the vehicle while the driver was unloading,"" a brewery spokesperson told the TT news agency.  The shop sits close to the city's central station, which was evacuated.  The metro, central roads and various bus lines were also shut down after the attack.  Shots were reportedly fired in another part of the city, but Swedish police told local media there was no connection between the two incidents.  City authorities said they had made several spaces, including a number of school buildings, available as temporary accommodation for those who could not get home because of transport disruptions.    They have also asked people not to share photographs of the victims online.  I was in Stockholm yesterday, ironically at a security conference. I don't think Sweden was prepared for something like this.  The last big terror incident they had was in 2010 when a failed suicide bomber blew himself up in a car in central Stockholm.  The country has good intelligence-gathering apparatus: Sapo, the Swedish equivalent to the UK's MI5 agency, have got the finger on the problem, but the legislation is not there to deal with it.  Insiders have been concerned for quite some time that Sweden has been a bit lax about security. It is important at this stage, though, to keep an open mind about the perpetrator. It's not impossible that it was someone with personal, psychological problems, rather than a political motive.

"DR Congo: Bruno Tshibala appointed new prime minister Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila has appointed Bruno Tshibala as the new prime minister of the power-sharing government.  Mr Tshibala will be leader until presidential elections later this year.  He was expelled from Congo's largest opposition party, the UDPS, last month after contesting the designation of successors to veteran leader Etienne Tshisekedi who died in February.  Mr Tshibala's appointment is likely to further divide Mr Kabila's opponents. Talks to negotiate his exit from power broke down last week. Mr Kabila was supposed to step down after his second and final five-year term came to an end last year but the vote to replace him was not held. The electoral commission cited financial and logistical difficulties.  The arrogance of power The failure to organise the polls led to a wave of deadly demonstrations by opposition supporters, with calls from diplomats for the president to respect the constitution.  The Roman Catholic Church stepped in to broker a deal at the end of 2016 which outlined the creation of a transitional government that would oversee the elections.  But the deal collapsed because the government and the opposition were unable to agree on the power-sharing mechanism under the arrangement.

"Trump to make China visit after hosting Xi for talks US President Donald Trump has accepted his counterpart Xi Jinping's invitation to make a visit to China, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump is hosting the Chinese president for a two-day visit at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.  Last year Mr Trump said China had ""raped the US"" and vowed to brand the superpower a currency manipulator. But the meeting appeared to be diplomatic, with both leaders agreeing to a new format for US-China talks.  Mr Tillerson said President Trump's trip to China would be a ""state visit"" in 2017, but gave no other details. ""Both the atmosphere and the chemistry between the two leaders was positive... all of us are feeling very good about the results of this summit,"" said Mr Tillerson. An A-Z of hot topics for Trump and Xi What can Trump do about trade with China? The cost of Trump's 'Winter White House'  The leaders of the world's two most powerful economies agreed to a 100-day plan to discuss trade talks directed at boosting US exports and reducing Washington's trade deficit with China, according to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  ""Given the range of issues and the magnitude, that may be ambitious, but it's a very big sea change in the pace of discussion,"" Mr Ross told reporters.  ""I think that's a very important symbolisation of the growing rapport between the two countries."" Mr Trump said he believes he made ""tremendous progress"" in the US-China relationship during talks with Mr Xi. On the night of the Chinese president's arrival, a US airstrike on an airbase in Syria was launched in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack. The attack was made public on Thursday evening just moments after Mr Xi and his wife left the resort following dinner. Beijing has avoided publicly taking sides on the issue. China's position on Syria is much closer to Russia's than to the US.  And the Chinese government will guess that the timing of the American missile strike was a blunt message that without more robust Chinese help on dismantling Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme, the next target for pre-emptive American military action might be North Korea. In Chinese protocol, sudden moves disrupting setpiece occasions are avoided wherever possible, and in private, President Xi is likely to be angry that President Trump chose to strike on the very night of his visit.  But in public Mr Xi stuck to his script about the virtues of co-operation while Mr Trump insisted they'd formed an outstanding relationship and made great progress.  As the two presidents went into their final lunch there were no specifics though, and in the aftermath of the US missile strike on Syria, all the big questions which bedevil the US China relationship have been kicked down the road for President Trump's visit to China later this year. According to a statement on China's foreign ministry website, Mr Xi told Mr Trump: ""We have a thousand reasons to get China-US relations right, and not one reason to spoil the China-US relationship."" The pair discussed a range of issues, including North Korea, which the US believes is trying to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the west coast of the US. Mr Tillerson said on Friday the US may take its own measure in dealing with Pyongyang.  ""We would be happy to work with them,"" he said. ""But we understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would and are prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to co-ordinate with us.""

"British Columbia ends high heel dress code requirements A Canadian province has scrapped the dress code which requires female employees to wear high heels. The government of British Columbia (BC) says the requirement is discriminatory as well as being a health and safety issue because they are dangerous. It says that high heel wearers face a risk of physical injury from slipping or falling as well as possible damage to the feet, legs and back. Footwear should be designed to allow workers to operate safely, it says. The announcement of the ban comes after a provincial Green party politician in March introduced a bill in the BC legislature aimed at preventing employers from setting gender-based footwear requirements.  BC Green Party leader Andrew Weaver filed a private member's bill ""designed to prevent employers from setting varying footwear and other requirements based on gender, gender expression or gender identity"".  His bill covered all workplaces, including retail and corporate offices.  But instead of implementing it, the provincial government opted instead to amend footwear rules under the Workers' Compensation Act. BC Premier Christy Clark said that in some provincial workplaces, women were unfairly required to wear high heels. ""Like most British Columbians, our government thinks this is wrong. That is why we're changing this regulation to stop this unsafe and discriminatory practice,"" she said. The new regulation states that workplace footwear must be of ""a design, construction and material that allows the worker to safely perform their work and ensures that employers cannot require footwear contrary to this standard"".  The new guidelines, drafted by WorkSafeBC, are expected to be available by the end of April. High heels - and whether women should be required to wear them in the workplace, or at the Cannes film festival - has become a fashion flashpoint in recent years.  Do men treat you better when you wear heels? High heels and flip-flops: Work dress code victims In Canada, much of the debate around dress codes for female employees has centred around the restaurant industry, where critics have said gender-specific dress codes are too common and based on stereotypes or sexist ideas of how a woman should dress.

"Uber: We did not steal Google's self-driving tech Uber has said claims it used self-driving technology stolen from Google were “demonstrably false”.  Waymo - a company spun out of Google - filed a lawsuit in February claiming former employee Andrew Levandowski had stolen 14,000 documents relating to LiDAR, a core technology used to guide autonomous vehicles.  Mr Levandowski went on to co-found Otto, a self-driving truck company acquired by Uber for $660m last year.   Waymo requested a judge grant an injunction on the use of the disputed technology, which could take Uber’s self-driving fleet - currently being tested in a few locations in the US - off the roads.  At a hearing earlier this week, Uber sought to convince a judge that an injunction would be unfair.  ""Waymo's injunction motion is a misfire,” said Angela Padilla, a lawyer for Uber, in a statement on Friday. ""There is no evidence that any of the 14,000 files in question ever touched Uber's servers, and Waymo's assertion that our multi-lens LiDAR is the same as their single-lens LiDAR is clearly false.”    Part of Uber’s defence is also an admission that it lags behind its competitors in the autonomous race. It said while it has been developing its own LiDAR tech, it has so far needed to rely on third-party companies to provide the system for its cars.  ""If Waymo genuinely thought that Uber was using its secrets, it would not have waited more than five months to seek an injunction,” Ms Padilla added.  ""Waymo doesn't meet the high bar for an injunction, which would stifle our independent innovation - probably Waymo's goal in the first place.""  Pleading the fifth Waymo argued that blueprints, mistakenly sent to Waymo via email last December, showed Uber’s plans to use the stolen designs in future.  The company dismissed Uber’s assertion that none of the files were on its servers by pointing out that the firm’s search had not been able to include the computer belonging to the man at the centre of the controversy, Mr Levandowski.  At a recent court hearing, held in private but leaked to the press, Mr Levandowski invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, a constitutional clause that allows US citizens to resist any request to share information that could put them at risk of self-incrimination.  The presiding judge advised that Uber should be firmer with Mr Levandowski in order to get access to the files - such as threatening to fire him if he did not co-operate.  ""If you cannot find them in your files there is going to be a preliminary injunction,” Judge William Alsup warned Uber.  ""You're not denying it, no one is denying he has the 14,000 files. You keep on your payroll someone who took 14,000 documents and is liable to use them.”  He added: ""This is an extraordinary case. I have never seen a record this strong in 42 years.

"Westminster Bridge attack victim Andreea Cristea dies A Romanian woman who fell into the Thames during the Westminster terror attack has died, police have said. Andreea Cristea is the fifth victim of the attack on 22 March, in which Khalid Masood drove into crowds on Westminster Bridge then stabbed a policeman to death, before being shot dead himself. Ms Cristea, 31, who was on holiday with boyfriend Andrei Burnaz, had been in hospital since the attack. It has emerged that Mr Burnaz had been planning to propose during the day out. A family statement confirmed Ms Cristea, who was an architect, had died on Thursday. The family said: ""After fighting for her life for over two weeks, our beloved and irreplaceable Andreea - wonderful daughter, sister, partner, dedicated friend and the most unique and life loving person you can imagine - was cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way.  ""She will always be remembered as our shining ray of light that will forever keep on shining in our hearts."" The family said they were ""deeply touched and eternally grateful"" to the ""never-ending dedication"" of the medical staff who treated Ms Cristea, saying their ""kindness and empathy are beyond compare"". ""There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and emptiness that is left in our hearts,"" they continued. Mr Burnaz, who sustained a broken foot in the attack, visited Westminster Bridge last week to lay a single white rose. The couple were in London to celebrate Mr Burnaz's birthday and he had been planning to propose to Ms Cristea that day, Romania's UK ambassador Dan Mihalache told the BBC. He said it was thought Masood's car had mounted the pavement and hit Mr Burnaz, before pushing Ms Cristea into the Thames. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""deeply saddened to hear of the death of Andreea Cristea"". He tweeted: ""Londoners hold her & her loved ones in our thoughts today."" The other people killed on the bridge were Aysha Frade, 44, who worked at a London sixth-form college, US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, from Utah, and retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London. Father-of-two PC Keith Palmer was fatally stabbed outside Parliament. Relatives of those killed joined members of the Royal Family at a ""service of hope"" held at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday.

"YouTube channels need 10,000 views for adverts YouTube is changing the rules about when users can start earning money through carrying adverts on their video channels. New channels will have to get 10,000 views before they can be considered for the YouTube Partner Program, the firm announced in a blog post. YouTube will then evaluate whether the channel is adhering to its guidelines before letting it carry adverts. It will help clamp down on content theft and fake channels, YouTube said. ""After a creator hits 10k lifetime views on their channel, we'll review their activity against our policies,"" wrote Ariel Bardin, vice president of product management at YouTube. ""If everything looks good, we'll bring this channel into YPP [YouTube Partner Program] and begin serving ads against their content. Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators who are playing by the rules."" Qingzhen Chen, senior analyst for advertising research from IHS, said it would not be difficult for most channel creators to get 10,000 views from a global audience of more than one billion users.

"Senate confirms Trump Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch The US Senate has confirmed President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, after a bitter, 14-month battle for control of the highest court in the land. The chamber voted 54-45 on Friday to seal the confirmation of Denver appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch. Republicans took the historic step this week of changing the chamber's rules in order to ram through their pick. At stake is the final legal say on everything from gun control to abortion to election finance to workers' rights. Mr Gorsuch, 49, was confirmed within 65 days of his nomination, but the battle to appoint another justice to the judicial bench began with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative darling, in February last year. It was the longest period a seat has remained unfilled on the Supreme Court since during the American Civil War in 1862. Though Mr Gorsuch proved evasive when questioned on legal matters during his confirmation hearings, he has a solidly conservative pedigree and is expected to rule accordingly. Republicans hope Mr Gorsuch will hand the bench's bloc of conservative justices a winning 5-4 majority. ""He's going to make an incredible addition to the court,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who led the anti-Gorsuch opposition, said the court was ""increasingly drifting towards becoming a more pro-corporate court that favours employers, corporations and special interests over working America"". On Thursday, Mr McConnell triggered a legislative manoeuvre known as the ""nuclear option"" when Republicans lacked the 60 votes required to end debate on Mr Gorsuch. The chamber's majority leader tore up the rulebook after Democrats mounted the first filibuster of such a nominee in half a century. The result is a triumph for Donald Trump's young presidency. For many of those who voted for him, getting a conservative judge on to America's highest court was a top priority. ""Congratulations to an exceptionally qualified and respected judge,"" the president tweeted. The vacancy on the nine-judge bench had left the justices to pass over many controversial issues, possibly to avoid a 4-4 stalemate.  The Democrats were left fuming last year when Republicans refused to consider former President Barack Obama's nominee to the court. Democrats used the ""nuclear option"" in 2013 to overturn Republican filibusters against executive branch and judicial nominees for lower courts. But they left the filibuster in place for Supreme Court nominees. Mr Gorsuch may be sworn in as early as Friday so he can start getting ready for the court's next session of oral arguments this month.

Google introduced its fact check feature on its News search site in October, but has now added it to its regular search results. Publishers who have investigated a claim, for example a politician's statements, will be displayed more prominently. A summary of the fact-checked statements and whether they are judged to be true or false will also appear. However, the feature will not affect the order of search results and will not label sites known to spread false information as untrustworthy. Google acknowledged that different publishers may draw opposing conclusions about the validity of a news story or statement, but said the feature would help people understand the ""degree of consensus"" on a topic. Analysis by Chris Foxx, BBC technology reporter Tackling the spread of false information is a big task for websites as large as Google and Facebook, given the volume of data involved. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has been clear he does not want to employ humans to make judgements about whether websites are trustworthy. Now Google is following his lead by placing its trust in its algorithms. Of course, algorithms can be manipulated and algorithms can get it wrong.  In March, Google was found to be offering up some far-fetched claims as ""instant answers"". Google also says it will display conflicting fact checks side-by-side when websites have drawn different conclusions.  That may leave people more confused than before - but perhaps, at least, it will encourage them to question what they read online.

"Travel websites ticked off over 'misleading' claims Websites that show bargain prices for flights, hotels and other travel bookings, are not giving customers accurate information, say European consumer protection authorities. The first price shown was often much lower than the final price, they said. Some offers that look too good to be true, are - because when you click to buy they aren't available. ""These websites are misleading consumers,"" said Vera Jourova, the EU commissioner responsible.  The Consumer Protection Cooperation body said the 235 websites that they had identified would be required to correct the problems. If websites failed to comply, national authorities could pursue legal proceedings, it said. ""The companies concerned need to respect the European consumer rules, just like a travel agent would,"" said Ms Jourova, the EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. Key findings: The CPC screened the sector in October 2016, covering 28 European countries. It checked a total of 352 sites, including ones offering to book accommodation, transport tickets and car rental.  Some were price comparison websites.

"Twitter forces US to drop demand for Trump critic's details The US government has dropped its request for the identity of an anti-Trump Twitter account, just a day after Twitter went to court over the issue. @ALT_USCIS anonymously criticised President Trump’s immigration policy, and claimed to be run by employees at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. US government officials issued a summons for identifying information. But Twitter said that demand had been withdrawn after it filed a lawsuit. The @ALT_USCIS account's followers also ballooned from 38,000 to 158,000 during the lawsuit's single-day lifespan. The original summons from the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency demanded ""all records regarding the twitter account @ALT_USCIS to include, user names, account login, phone numbers, mailing addresses, and IP (computer) addresses"". But the law cited by the agency - which is part of the Department of Homeland Security - is typically used to obtain records about imported goods. The summons also demanded the information by 13 March 2017 - a day before the request was even sent to Twitter. Twitter went to court in San Francisco to block the move, saying the CBP was ""abusing a limited-purpose investigatory tool"" and stifling freedom of speech. The micro-blogging service was backed by the American Civil Liberties union (ACLU), which said it would join the court battle. But the request was withdrawn by the government a day later, after Twitter's court filing became public. A justice department official told AFP news agency that the investigation had ended - but no details were given. ""We want to thank @twitter and @aclu for standing up for the right of free anonymous speech,"" the @ALT_USCIS account tweeted. ""Thank you resistance for standing up for us."" In January, when Donald Trump became President Trump, several so-called ""alternative"" accounts for US government services began appearing online. Many claimed to be controlled by current or former staff members. Twitter said this is ""a new and innovative class of American speakers"" who need anonymity because they could face retaliation or lose their jobs. ""Permitting the CBP to pierce the pseudonym of the @ALT _UCCIS account would have a grave chilling effect on the speech of that account in particular and on the many other 'alternative agency' accounts that have been created to voice dissent to government policies"", it said. The ""alternative"" departments sprung up on Twitter following the gagging of the official National Parks Service Twitter account. On Mr Trump's inauguration day, it tweeted a photo of the crowd, comparing it with the 2009 inauguration of then President Barack Obama. The account was briefly shut down in response - reportedly because President Trump complained directly to the head of the National Parks Service.",Saturday 08 April 2017,8-Apr-17,Twitter wins anti-Trump privacy battle,"A government agency wanted the identity of a Trump critic, but has withdrawn their request.",http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39535929
"Samsung boss Lee Jae-yong goes on trial in South Korea The acting head of Samsung Group has gone on trial in South Korea for his alleged role in a corruption scandal that led to the ousting of the president. Lee Jae-yong denies charges of embezzlement and perjury. Prosecutors say he gave 43bn Korean won ($38m; £30m) to President Park Guen-hye's friend for political favours. Ms Park is suspected of colluding with Choi Soon-sil to get conglomerates to donate to Ms Choi's foundations. Ms Park was arrested last week, after being impeached, and sent to a detention centre, although she has not yet been formally charged. Mr Lee, who appeared in court in handcuffs, has denied the bribery allegations, saying Samsung was coerced into handing over the funds. Another four Samsung executives have also appeared in court in connection with the scandal. They also deny the accusations.     - Grandson of Samsung founder  Lee Byung-chul, son of current chairman Lee Kun-hee.    - Also known as Jay Y Lee, the 48-year-old has spent his entire career in the company.     - Is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and was nominated to join the firm's board in October 2016.     - Despite his arrest, still widely expected to take overall control of Samsung.     - Critics say his rise through Samsung has been due to his birth, not his business experience.   Mr Lee's case is ""one of the most deep-rooted and typical cases involving unhealthy relations between politicians and businessmen,"" said Special Prosecutor Park Young-Soo in his opening statement in Seoul's Central District Court. Mr Lee, the 48-year-old vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, has been the parent company Samsung Group's de facto head since his father Lee Kun-hee suffered a heart attack in 2014. He was arrested in February. On Friday, the chairman of the powerful Lotte conglomerate, Shin Dong-bin, was also being questioned by prosecutors in connection with the widening corruption probe. They are investigating whether donations given by Lotte to foundations allegedly controlled by Ms Choi were bribes connected to the firm's bid for a lucrative duty-free business.  There are hopes that whoever replaces Ms Park will push for real reform in the biggest conglomerates, known as chaebols. But how realistic are those reforms in a country where the top 10 chaebols own more than a quarter of all business assets? Samsung's sales alone make up a fifth of South Korea's gross domestic product. In the run-up to presidential elections in May, candidates have made chaebol reform a major pillar of their campaign promises.  But unpicking the complex and powerful hold these family-run firms have over the South Korean economy will take more than just rhetoric.

"Venezuela opposition march over Henrique Capriles ban Thousands of Venezuelans have marched in protest against the banning from politics of opposition leader Henrique Capriles for 15 years.  In Caracas, police used tear gas to prevent demonstrators reaching the offices of the national ombudsman.  Saturday's protest came after a week of anti-government demonstrations.   They were initially sparked by a Supreme Court ruling to curb the powers of the national assembly, a move which was later overturned.   Security police fired tear gas on one major avenue in Caracas while in the city of San Cristobal they shot rubber bullets towards protestors.  Many people carried signs reading ""No to dictatorship!"" and ""Capriles for President"". In the Caracas protest there was a moment of silence in memory of a young man shot dead on Thursday by police during demonstrations.  Mr Capriles has been at the forefront of demands for a recall referendum on President Nicolas Maduro.  A former presidential candidate who has run twice, he is seen as the oppositions's best hope of defeating Mr Maduro in elections scheduled for next year.  The ruling by the Venezuelan comptroller said the ban on Mr Capriles was due to ""administrative irregularities"" in his role as governor.  Venezuela: What's behind the turmoil?  The most expensive Nutella in the world Leopoldo Lopez loses appeal Henrique Capriles is the latest in a series of prominent opposition politicians to be put out of action.  Two years ago, Maria Corina Machado, a former congresswoman was banned from office as was a former mayor, Daniel Ceballos.   In 2015 another prominent opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, was sentenced to nearly 14 years in prison on charges of inciting violence during anti-government protests in 2014.  Venezuelans are dealing with the effects of a harsh economic crisis that has millions skipping meals, unable to afford soaring prices for basic goods and facing long lines for scarce products.  Mr Maduro's socialist government have said that a US-backed business elite is responsible for Venezuela's economic downturn and that it is trying to organise a coup to impose right-wing rule.",Sunday 09 April 2017,9-Apr-17,Venezuela march backs banned politician,Opposition leader Henrique Capriles has been banned from politics for 15 years.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39542181
"Eta disarms: French police find 3.5 tonnes of weapons Police in France have found nearly 3.5 tonnes of weapons, explosives and other material in eight caches handed over by Basque separatist group Eta.  Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the weapons would be destroyed.  Eta - which says it has now surrendered all its weapons - killed more than 800 people in some 40 years of violence in pursuit of an independent country straddling France and Spain. Mr Cazeneuve hailed the move but Spain called on Eta to disband.  Eta declared a ceasefire in 2011 but did not disarm.  What is Eta? Timeline: Eta campaign IS and Eta: Is terror threat to Europe greater today? The caches contained 120 firearms, three tonnes of explosives and several thousand rounds of ammunition, a spokesman for the Artisans of Peace, the group which mediated between Eta and the French authorities, said earlier.  ""The government will not change its position: terrorists cannot expect favourable treatment... much less impunity for their crimes,"" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in a statement.  The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid says the typically cool response from the Rajoy government shows its determination not to be seen to be giving any ground, as well as reflecting the overall scepticism regarding Eta among the political class in Madrid.  Despite its weak position, Eta and its political supporters now want some kind of concession, such as moving prisoners to Basque jails, our correspondent says - but there is no sign the government will allow this.  The French prime minister said the Eta move was ""a decisive step towards the end of Basque separatist terrorism"". ""Whether the disarmament is, effectively, total will also be  established,"" Mr Cazeneuve added. Thousands of people joined a pro-Eta rally in Bayonne to mark ""Disarmament Day"" on Saturday afternoon.  A simple ceremony in a city hall ended Eta's campaign for independence. In an elegant, high-ceilinged room, five people sat around a table as early-morning light filtered through the drapes.  Bayonne Mayor Jean-Rene Etchegaray welcomed them to a ""moment we have all been waiting for"".  After a few speeches, French Basque environmentalist Txetx Etcheverry approached the table with a bulky black file. From where I sat, I could see it included photographs as well as text.  The dossier was handed to international witnesses. French security forces discreetly secured the area and the Spanish government raised no objections to the ceremony going ahead.  Ram Manikkalingam of the International Verification Commission called it a ""new model of disarmament and verification which emerged from Basque society"". The group was set up more than 50 years ago in the era of Spanish dictator General Franco, who repressed the Basques politically and culturally.  Eta's goal was to create an independent Basque state out of territory in south-west France and northern Spain. Its first known killing was in 1968, when a secret police chief was shot dead in the Basque city of San Sebastian. France and Spain refuse to negotiate with Eta, which is on the EU blacklist of terrorist organisations.  Slowly, and with many false starts.  Eta used parts of south-western France as a base, even though most of its operations were against Spanish targets in Spain. The group has, however, killed some French policemen, but mostly during police raids on members of the group. Eta's first ceasefire was in 1998, but collapsed the following year. A similar declaration in 2006 only lasted a matter of months, ending when Eta bombed an airport car park, killing two people.  Four years later, in 2010, Eta announced it would not carry out further attacks and in January 2011, it declared a permanent and ""internationally verifiable"" ceasefire but refused to disarm. In recent years, police in France and Spain have arrested hundreds of Eta figures and seized many of its weapons.  Eta's political wing, Herri Batasuna, was banned by the Spanish government, which argued that the two groups were inextricably linked.

"Stockholm attack: 'Suspect device' in Sweden crash lorry Swedish police have confirmed they discovered a suspect device inside the lorry which was driven into a Stockholm department store on Friday. The device was found in the driver's seat, National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson said, but it was not known whether it was a bomb. Mr Eliasson also said the suspect in custody was from Uzbekistan, 39, and known to security services. The hijacked lorry was driven into Ahlens department store in the capital. Four people were killed - 10 remain in hospital, including a child. Two are in intensive care. Eyewitnesses: Lorry was 'trying to hit people' Late on Saturday, police in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, found a ""bomb-like device"" in the Groenland district of the city and detained a man. The area was cordoned off and a controlled explosion carried out.  Police say further investigations are continuing. The suspect, who was not named, was known to the security services. However, he had only been seen as a ""marginal character"", Mr Eliasson said. The head of Swedish security police, Anders Thornberg, said the suspect was ""a person who has previously figured in our intelligence flow"". It is not clear if the suspect was resident in Sweden.  Mr Eliasson said police had reason to believe the suspect was the man behind the attack. But he added: ""We still cannot rule out that more people are involved."" On Saturday, there were reports of more police raids in Sweden. However, police told Reuters they had not made any further arrests.  Police say it is too early to tell what the ""technical device"" in the lorry was - only that ""it should not be there"". ""I cannot say at this stage that this is a bomb or some sort of flammable material,"" Mr Eliasson said.   ""We are doing a technical investigation."" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has called it a terrorist attack, with borders tightened at his request.  ""Terrorists want us to be afraid, want us to change our behaviour, want us to not live our lives normally, but that is what we're going to do."" ""Terrorists can never defeat Sweden, never,"" Mr Lofven said. ""We're also determined to continue to be an open society; a democratic society.""  The mayor of Stockholm, Karin Wanngard, reiterated that Stockholm was open. ""This is not an attack that's about the colour of your skin,"" she said. ""We can show that with good integration, with an openness and a friendly behaviour, we are stronger together and it doesn't matter where you come from."" Sweden's king, Carl XVI Gustaf, said: ""We are all shaken by what has happened."" He added that those ""who want to help, are more than those who want to hurt us"". ""Unfortunately we've experienced many acts of violence before and we have coped and we will now too."" There will be a minute's silence in Sweden at midday on Monday to commemorate the dead. Sweden has generally low crime rates, and has been ranked as one of the safest countries in the world. In 2010, two bombs detonated in central Stockholm, killing the attacker - an Iraq-born Swedish man - and injuring two others. In October 2015, a masked man who was believed to have far-right sympathies killed a teacher and pupil in a sword attack. In February, US President Donald Trump cited a non-existent terror attack in Sweden, and blamed it on the country's asylum policy - baffling many Swedes. Sweden has taken in nearly 200,000 refugees and migrants in recent years - more per capita than any other European country. However, there was a drop in numbers last year after the country introduced new border checks. Separately, Sweden is believed to have the highest number of Islamic State group fighters per capita in Europe.

"IS in Afghanistan: US special forces soldier is killed An American special forces soldier has been killed while carrying out operations against the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Afghanistan, the US military has said. It says the soldier was killed while fighting IS in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan. Nangarhar province borders Pakistan and has a reputation for being a centre of IS militancy. US forces have launched several air strikes on jihadist bases in the area. IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It was the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world. Within a few weeks, the group appeared in at least five Afghan provinces. including Helmand, Zabul, Farah, Logar and Nangarhar, trying to establish pockets of territory from which to expand.    IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? It was the first major militant group to directly challenge the Afghan Taliban's dominance over the local insurgency.  Yet despite efforts to energise battle-weary militants, IS struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in Afghanistan. Instead, it made enemies of almost everyone, including the Afghan Taliban. In the first half of 2015, IS managed to capture large chunks of territory in eastern Nangarhar province.  The new 'Great Game' in Afghanistan Islamic State group: The full story IS is also trying to get a foothold in northern Afghanistan, where it aims to link up with Central Asian, Chechen and Chinese Uighur militants. But it has largely been eliminated from southern and western Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and military operations conducted by Afghan and US/Nato forces.

They cited an unnamed government spokesman saying Friday's strike was an ""intolerable act of aggression against a sovereign state"". The strikes followed Wednesday's suspected chemical attack on a rebel-held Syrian town which killed 89. North Korea has carried out tests to develop a nuclear missile. The UN has banned it from missile or nuclear tests. But it has repeatedly broken those sanctions. It has successfully tested nuclear bombs of increasing power and claims to have been able to make warheads small enough to fit on a missile, but some experts have cast doubt on those claims. On Friday, US missiles struck a Syrian airbase, killing at least six people. It was the first US attack on a Syrian government facility, although the country had previously targeted the Islamic State group in the region. ""The US missile attack against Syria is a clear and intolerable act of aggression against a sovereign state and we strongly condemn it,"" a government official in North Korea said, as quoted by the KCNA news agency.

"Boris Johnson calls off Moscow visit over Syria The UK foreign secretary has called off a visit to Moscow in the wake of the Syrian chemical weapons attack. Boris Johnson, who had been due to travel on Monday, said the situation had changed ""fundamentally"" and his priority was to build international support for a ceasefire. He said the UK called on Russia to do everything possible to bring about a ""political settlement in Syria"". ""We deplore Russia's continued defence of the Assad regime,"" he added.  The US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will visit Moscow as planned after the G7 meeting on 10-11 April.

He said he was working to bring together other ""like-minded partners"" to ""explore next steps"".  After the G7 meeting between the world's leading seven industrialised nations Mr Tillerson would be able to deliver a ""clear and co-ordinated message to the Russians"", he said. The foreign secretary called on Russia to work with the rest of the international community to ""ensure the shocking events of the last week are never repeated"".  The Russian Embassy responded to the cancellation of Mr Johnson's visit with a tweet linking to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The embassy in London said: ""@BorisJohnson cancelled his visit to Moscow: theatrics for lack of argument? Safer in G7 pack? Listen to our soft power response.""  Eighty-nine people, including 33 children and 18 women, died in a suspected nerve agent attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday.  The figures come from Idlib's opposition-run health authority. The country's government denies using nerve gas. On Friday, the US carried out missile strikes on a Syrian air base it says is suspected of storing chemical weapons. At least six people are reported to have died.  In response, Syria's ally Russia accused the US of encouraging ""terrorists"" with unilateral actions. Moscow has further promised to strengthen Syria's anti-aircraft defences and it is shutting down a hotline with the US designed to avoid collisions between their air forces over the country. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has said ""terrorists are celebrating"" the US strikes on a Syrian airbase.

"Boy, 14, tried to buy sub-machine gun on the dark web, court hears A 14-year-old boy has appeared in court in Northern Ireland accused of trying to buy a sub-machine gun and 100 rounds of ammunition from the dark web. The boy appeared in Ballymena Magistrates' Court in County Antrim. He is charged with attempting to possess a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life.  A police officer told the court that she believed the boy's intention was to intimidate another person using the weapon. He was arrested at a retail park in Coleraine, County Londonderry on Thursday.  A police officer said the boy was detained when he met an ""operative"" at the retail park. The court heard that the accused tried to give the operative £150 to pay for the ammunition and that he believed he could further purchase the gun.  It also heard that the defendant told the operative that ""his intention was to intimidate a third party"".  The police officer told the court that during an interview with police, the boy provided a pre-prepared statement naming a Jamaican man who he said had asked him to collect blank ammunition and a deactivated gun. The officer said the accused told police he was to collect the deactivated gun in a few days. She added: ""It was in fact a live gun and ammunition."" The officer said the police opposed bail and alleged the defendant's only reason for purchasing the gun was to cause serious injury. She said: ""The account provided was somewhat unbelievable. ""He provided an account that he was purchasing a gun for a male that was a Jamaican national living in Northern Ireland who he was friendly with on Facebook."" She said none of his friends on Facebook matched the name given for the 40-year-old friend.

A police officer told the court that she believed the boy's intention was to intimidate another person using the weapon. He was arrested at a retail park in Coleraine, County Londonderry on Thursday.  A police officer said the boy was detained when he met an ""operative"" at the retail park. The court heard that the accused tried to give the operative £150 to pay for the ammunition and that he believed he could further purchase the gun.  It also heard that the defendant told the operative that ""his intention was to intimidate a third party"".  The police officer told the court that during an interview with police, the boy provided a pre-prepared statement naming a Jamaican man who he said had asked him to collect blank ammunition and a deactivated gun. The officer said the accused told police he was to collect the deactivated gun in a few days. She added: ""It was in fact a live gun and ammunition."" The officer said the police opposed bail and alleged the defendant's only reason for purchasing the gun was to cause serious injury. She said: ""The account provided was somewhat unbelievable. ""He provided an account that he was purchasing a gun for a male that was a Jamaican national living in Northern Ireland who he was friendly with on Facebook."" She said none of his friends on Facebook matched the name given for the 40-year-old friend. The officer said if the child was released he could destroy evidence by deleting any conversations he may have had online. However, the accused's lawyer said there was no evidence presented to support what his client's intent was and described the police's assertions as ""guesswork"".  The judge released the defendant on bail of £500 with conditions that he stays at home overnight and does not possess a mobile phone or any other internet-enabled device.  He was also warned that he could spend months in a juvenile justice centre awaiting trial if he broke any of the conditions.

"Grands Prix-style events on English roads get go-ahead Monaco-style Grands Prix events could be hosted on English roads under new laws coming into force on Monday. They will allow motorsport promoters to apply for permission from local authorities to close public roads in England to stage races. The government said the move ""could be a real boost"" to tourism.  The final decision on whether a race is safe to proceed would be made by councils, police and other local bodies.  Motoring fixtures from small-scale local events to international races, such as a city-based Grand Prix, could get the green light. Transport minister Andrew Jones said: ""This could be a real boost for the economies of an area. ""The examples would be in cycling. We had the Tour de France here, we had a Grand Depart in Yorkshire a couple of years ago and roads were closed as part of that event and thousands of people came to watch it.  ""It had a huge impact, not just for boosting cycling in the UK, but for boosting tourism wherever it went."" A public consultation in 2014 on changing the law to allow motor racing on English roads met with an ""overwhelming positive"" response, he added.  Mr Jones denied the new rules could send the wrong message when there is fierce debate over traffic pollution in England's cities. A spokesman for London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""In considering whether to support a Grand Prix in London, the mayor would need to see what the impacts are on air pollution."" Khan's spokesman went on to say that the mayor was in discussion with Formula E over whether a race involving environmentally friendly electric-powered cars could be held on London's streets. Under the new laws, local authorities will be allowed to suspend the Road Traffic Act for authorised motorsports events, without the need for an individual act of parliament. The new rules would mark a ""seismic shift for UK motor sport,"" according to the Motor Sports Association (MSA), which has campaigned to bring closed-road events to the UK. ""We can now take motorsport to the people, and in turn those local hosting communities have the opportunity to benefit from the economic boost that these events may provide,"" said MSA chief executive Rob Jones. Silverstone hosted the first Formula One world championship in 1950 and has been the permanent home of the British Grand Prix since 1987. But many international cities host motor racing circuits held on temporarily closed public roads, like the Circuit de Monaco, Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan and Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore.   Three times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, in pole position for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix, has said a street circuit in Beijing would be ""epic"". Former Formula One world champion Nigel Mansell welcomed the new rules, calling them a ""great move forward"" for motorsport.

"Grand National 2017: One For Arthur, ridden by Derek Fox, wins   
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         One For Arthur became only the second Scottish-trained winner of the Grand National after a four-and-a-half-length victory at Aintree. The 14-1 shot, ridden by Derek Fox and trained by Lucinda Russell, charged clear to finish ahead of Cause Of Causes (16-1) and Saint Are (25-1). Jockey Fox only returned to riding this week having broken a wrist and a collarbone in March. The 8-1 favourite Blaklion, who led for much of the contest, was fourth. Gas Line Boy - a 50-1 outsider - was fifth with Becher Chase and Grand National Trial winner Vieux Lion Rouge (12-1) sixth. The win was just the second by a Scottish-trained horse since Rubstic's victory in 1979. In sunny conditions in Liverpool, 19 of the 40 horses finished the race, with Aintree reporting afterwards that all runners came back safely. Fox, who broke his wrist and dislocated a collarbone just over a month ago, told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It's the best feeling I've ever had. He's just such a brave horse. It's a sign of a true racehorse to win the Grand National. It's unbelievable. ""I was injured on 9 March, I got a heavy fall on the novice chase and that was four weeks ago on Thursday.  ""This is the best feeling I have ever had or probably ever will have and I want to take most of it in. I don't often get a chance to ride a horse as good as that.""  Russell, whose partner and assistant is former champion jockey Peter Scudamore, is the fourth woman to train a Grand National winner after Jenny Pitman, Venetia Williams and Sue Smith. ""He's amazing,"" she said. ""He's improved every time. I kept thinking barring accidents, he would win the National and he has. ""Together [Peter and I] we have had good and bad times but the horses are all back in form now. ""He's done us proud, he's done Scotland proud and he's done everyone at the yard proud."" The winning owners are Deborah Thomson and Belinda McClung, who go under the name 'The Two Golf Widows'. Thomson said: ""I just can't believe it. It's been an absolutely amazing day. Arthur just cruised that race, Derek rode so well and I'm just a bit lost for words really. ""He's given us a fantastic journey."" McClung added: ""I thought this morning, it's baking hot so there's no pressure now, he's not going to win on that ground but I have to say he's just shown his class today. ""He's amazing and he got a great ride."" Aintree stewards referred 31 of the 40 Grand National jockeys, including winner Fox, to the British Horseracing Authority after it took three attempts to get the race started. Runners and riders were twice called back after some set off before the starter was happy an orderly line had formed. Nine jockeys were exonerated, but the starter reported the rest to the stewards, saying they approached the tape before the flag was raised. The BHA will consider whether to take further action. After the false starts, the race eventually got under way but began with exits at the first fence for Vicente (16-1) and Cocktails At Dawn (33-1). Definitly Red (10-1), who was an impressive winner at Doncaster last month for Brian Ellison, was pulled up at the Canal Turn, with jockey Danny Cook revealing that an awkward landing sent his saddle slipping round and the pair out of the race. The ending was equally eventful as a collision coming over the last saw Blaklion overtaken before One For Arthur showed greater speed to hold off the valiant Cause Of Causes. Jamie Codd, rider of the Gordon Elliott-trained Cause Of Causes, said: ""He's a fantastic little horse. I thought I had half a chance at the back of the last, but the winner has won quite well on the day. ""My horse has galloped all the way to the line. He's an incredible little horse. I'm disappointed I didn't win, but he's run a great race."" BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght The cheers may have been loudest for this emphatic winner around Lucinda Russell's base near Kinross, but they will echo across jump racing's north of England and Scottish circuit.  Jumping in the north is regularly - and correctly - portrayed as the poor relation to its cousins in the south. The bigger investors tend to stay away. However, three Grand National runners - also Definitly Red and Highland Lodge - boded well, and One For Arthur, who's done a majority of his racing at places like Kelso, Carlisle and Ayr, has been invaluable to show it can be done perfectly well north of the Trent as well; will those biggest investors take notice?

"Saudi Arabia unveils plans for 'entertainment city' near Riyadh Saudi Arabia has unveiled plans for an entertainment city on the edge of Riyadh which will be 50 times the size of Gibraltar once complete. The 334 sq km (129 sq mile) attraction - about the same as Las Vegas - will offer cultural, sporting and entertainment activities - including a Six Flags park and a safari park. The announcement boasts it will be the first of its kind in the world. Building will begin early next year and the first stage finished by 2022. It forms part of a wider master plan. Vision 2030, announced by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman a year ago, aims to diversify the economy and reduce the kingdom's reliance on oil, through a series of projects. The entertainment city - about a fifth of the area of Riyadh in size - is the latest to be announced. Authorities say the hope is it will not only attract visitors but ""achieve a healthy and harmonious life, and provide more entertainment, joy and fun"" for those who live in the capital. However, it is unclear how something like a Six Flags will work in a country where women and men are largely segregated.

"Egypt declares state of emergency after deadly church attacks Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has announced a three-month state of emergency after attacks on two Coptic churches that left at least 44 dead. The measure allows authorities to make arrests without warrants and search people's homes. It needs to be approved by parliament before it is implemented. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the blasts in Tanta and Alexandria on Palm Sunday. The group has targeted Copts in Egypt recently and warns of more attacks. Mr Sisi made a defiant speech at the presidential palace after a meeting of the national defence council to discuss the explosions. He warned that the war against the jihadists would be ""long and painful"", and said that the state of emergency would come into force after all ""legal and constitution steps"" were taken. The majority in parliament backs Mr Sisi. The president had earlier ordered the deployment of the military across the country to protect ""vital and important infrastructure"". The move by Mr Sisi is likely to raise concerns among human rights activists, observers say. The president, a former army chief, has been criticised by local and international groups for severe restrictions on civil and political rights in Egypt. Human Rights Watch says tens of thousands of people have been arrested in a crackdown on dissent, and that security forces have committed flagrant abuses, including torture, enforced disappearances and likely extrajudicial executions.  The attacks coincided with one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar, marking the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem.   IS said that two suicide bombers carried out the blasts. One targeted St George's Coptic church in the northern city of Tanta, where 27 people were killed, the health ministry said. Hours later, police stopped the bomber from entering the St Mark's Coptic church in Alexandria, also in the north. He detonated his explosives outside, leaving 17 dead, including several police officers. ""Crusaders and their apostate allies should know the bill between us and them is very big and they will pay it with rivers of blood from their children, god willing. Wait for us, for we will wait for you,"" the jihadist group said in a statement quoted by Reuters news agency. The blasts came weeks before an expected visit by Pope Francis intended to show support for the country's Christians, who make up about 10% of Egypt's population and have long complained of being vulnerable and marginalised.   This sense of precariousness has only increased in recent years, with the rise of violent jihadism in parts of Egypt, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. The community's trust in the state's ability and willingness to protect them will now be even more deeply shaken after the attacks, our correspondent adds.   The Coptic Orthodox Church is the main Christian Church in Egypt. While most Copts live in Egypt, the Church has about a million members outside the country. Copts believe that their Church dates back to around 50 AD, when the Apostle Mark is said to have visited Egypt. The head of the Church is called the Pope and is considered to be the successor of St Mark. This makes it one of the earliest Christian groups outside the Holy Land. The Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ.  The early Church suffered persecution under the Roman Empire, and there were intermittent persecutions after Egypt became a Muslim country. Many believe that continues to this day.

"Tillerson: Russia 'failure allowed Syria chemical attack' US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has criticised Russia, saying it had failed to prevent Syria from carrying out a chemical attack on a rebel-held town. Russia had agreed to ensure Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles were destroyed - and its failure to do this enabled the attack, he said. G7 foreign ministers are preparing to meet in Italy later on Monday. Talks will focus on how to increase pressure on Russia to distance itself from Syria's President Bashar Al-Assad. On Tuesday, Mr Tillerson will continue from the G7 to Moscow, where he will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Russia is the Syrian government's main ally, and helped facilitate a 2013 agreement to destroy Syria's chemical arsenal. The suspected chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun last Wednesday left 89 people dead. In response, the US fired 59 missiles at a Syrian airbase on Friday. Syria has denied using any chemical agents, and Russia says the US gave no evidence Syria has chemical weapons. The next two days will be dominated by a collective search for arguments to persuade President Vladimir Putin he must now end Russia's military support for President Assad and help accelerate a negotiated political transition. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is expected to press the case for new sanctions against Russia if they don't give ground. Mr Tillerson wants to go on from here to Moscow able to confront the Russians with a strong set of demands backed by key US allies. But Mr Tillerson made clear over the weekend that Washington still regards the number one priority in Syria to be the elimination of so-called Islamic State. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran, President Assad's key military backers, are threatening retaliation if there are any further American air strikes and the task of breaking the present deadlocks over Syria remains enormous. Trump acts decisively in Syria: Now what? Syria 'chemical attack': What we know Why was Syria's Shayrat airbase bombed? Speaking on CBS's Face The Nation, Mr Tillerson said there was no evidence to suggest Russia was part of the alleged chemical attack. However, ""whether Russia was complicit here or whether they were simply incompetent or whether they got outwitted"" by the Syrian government, they had ""failed in their commitment to the international community"", he said. Russia had agreed to ""be the guarantor of the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles... the result of their failure has led to the killing of more children and innocents,"" Mr Tillerson added. The Russian government has denied that Syria carried out a chemical attack, saying that civilians on the ground were poisoned after Syrian planes struck a depot producing chemical weapons for rebels. Western governments, rebel leaders and a weapons expert all criticised this claim, saying the evidence pointed to an attack by the Syrian government. Following the suspected attack, US President Donald Trump launched air strikes against a Syrian government air base, and branded Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad a ""dictator"" who had ""launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians"". The Syrian government called the strikes ""foolish and irresponsible"", while Russia accused the US of ""an act of aggression against a sovereign state delivered in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext"". A joint command centre comprising the forces of President Assad's allies, including Russia and Iran, issued a statement saying the US strike had crossed ""red lines"". ""From now on we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is and America knows our ability to respond well,"" said the statement published by the group on media outlet Ilam al Harbi (War Media).",Monday 10 April 2017,10-Apr-17,Russian 'failure allowed Syria attack',US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Russia did not ensure Syria destroyed its chemical weapons.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39548388
"Chuck Berry: Fans queue to pay their last respects Fans in the US state of Missouri have been paying their final respects to the rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry who died last month aged 90. They were allowed to view the performer's body at the Pageant club in St Louis before a private family funeral on Sunday.  As fans filed past the open coffin a musician played some of Chuck Berry's greatest hits. The guitarist and songwriter died in Missouri after a seven-decade career. Among those paying tribute to the musician on Sunday was Kiss rocker Gene Simmons. The former US President Bill Clinton sent a letter lauding ""one of America's greatest rock and roll pioneers"". ""He captivated audiences around the world,"" the letter said, ""and his music spoke to the hopes and dreams we all had in common.  ""Me and Hillary grew up listening to him."" Berry played at both of Bill Clinton's presidential inaugurations. As the private service for Berry began, the Rev Alex Peterson told the crowd that the aim of the day was ""to celebrate Berry in a rock 'n' roll style"".  ""We're not going to sit here and be sad,"" Mr Peterson was quoted by the St Louis Post-Despatch as saying. As fans earlier filed past the open coffin - which had a red Gibson guitar bolted to the lid - a musician played some of the dead star's most memorable compositions, including Johnny B Goode, Sweet Little Sixteen and Roll Over Beethoven.   Among the floral arrangements was one in the shape of a guitar sent by the Rolling Stones. Seen as one of the fathers of rock 'n' roll, Berry influenced generations of succeeding musicians, most notably The Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys. Berry was known for trademark four-bar guitar introductions and quickfire lyrics that reflected the rebelliousness of 1950s teenagers.  He received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1984 and was among the first inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. Berry was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1926, and had his first hit, Maybellene, in 1955. He went on to score a succession of hits that were aimed at adolescent audiences, transcending the colour bar that plagued many black artists of his generation.",Monday 10 April 2017,10-Apr-17,Final farewells to music icon Chuck Berry,The rock 'n' roll legend is buried in his home town of St Louis after a final day of tributes.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39549251
"Great Barrier Reef: Two-thirds damaged in 'unprecedented' bleaching Unprecedented coral bleaching in consecutive years has damaged two-thirds of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, aerial surveys have shown. The bleaching - or loss of algae - affects a 1,500km (900 miles) stretch of the reef, according to scientists.  The latest damage is concentrated in the middle section, whereas last year's bleaching hit mainly the north.  Experts fear the proximity of the two events will give damaged coral little chance to recover. Prof Terry Hughes, from James Cook University, said governments must urgently address climate change to prevent further bleaching. ""Since 1998, we have seen four of these events and the gap between them has varied substantially, but this is the shortest gap we have seen,"" Prof Hughes told the BBC. ""The sooner we take action on global greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from fossil fuels to renewables, the better."" Almost 800 coral reefs across 8,000km were assessed by the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. The findings showed only the southern section was relatively unscathed. Researcher Dr James Kerry said the damage was unprecedented. ""The central third this year, I would say, was as severe in terms of bleaching as what we saw as the northern third last year,"" he told the BBC. ""For those reefs that were hit two years in a row, it is effectively a double whammy. They have had no chance to recover from last year's events."" The latest damage happened without the assistance of El Niño, a weather pattern previously associated with bleaching events. The reef - a vast collection of thousands of smaller coral reefs stretching from the northern tip of Queensland to the state's southern city of Bundaberg - was given World Heritage status in 1981. The UN says it is the ""most biodiverse"" of all the World Heritage sites, and of ""enormous scientific and intrinsic importance"".",Monday 10 April 2017,10-Apr-17,Damage to Great Barrier Reef 'unprecedented',"Coral bleaching has hit two-thirds of Australia's Great Barrier Reef within two years, surveys show.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39524196

"Masters 2017: Sergio Garcia pips Justin Rose to win at Augusta By Jonathan Jurejko BBC Sport 
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Spain's Sergio Garcia won his first major title at his 74th attempt with a thrilling play-off victory over England's Justin Rose at the Masters. Both players finished on nine under par after 72 holes at Augusta, setting up a sudden-death play-off on the 18th. Garcia, 37, holed a birdie putt for victory after his European Ryder Cup team-mate could only manage a bogey.  Charl Schwartzel was third on six under with England's Paul Casey and Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy in the top 10. Jordan Spieth, one of the pre-tournament favourites, and fellow American Rickie Fowler both fell away badly on the final day. Spieth, champion in 2015, signed for a three-over-par 75, while playing partner Fowler carded a 76 to finish tied in 11th on one under. Garcia finally won one of golf's four majors - the Open Championship, the US Open and the US PGA Championship are the other three - after 22 previous top-10 finishes. He became the third Spaniard to win the Masters - after Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal - on what would have been the 60th birthday of Ballesteros, who died in 2011. ""To join Seve and Jose - my two idols - is amazing,"" said Garcia. Shot one: Rose teed off first on the 18th, pushing his drive right into the trees, only for his ball to bounce back towards play and reappear in the pine needles. Garcia thumped his drive almost 300 yards down the fairway. Shot two: Rose could only punch his way out of trouble onto the fairway, while Garcia landed his approach on the green, 12 feet from the hole. Shot three: The Englishman responded by hitting his ball about 15 foot to the right of the hole - on a similar line to his putt in regulation play about 15 minutes earlier. Rose missed his par putt to the left of the hole, leaving Garcia two shots for victory and the Spaniard rolled in his first attempt, with his ball circling the cup before dropping in. Garcia dropped to his knees in celebration, and Rose instantly walked over to congratulate him as they shared a warm embrace on the green.

                         Garcia and Rose, who started playing against each other as teenagers and have become firm friends since, went out as Sunday's final pairing after sharing the overnight lead on six under. Rose has long craved a follow-up victory to his 2013 US Open win, in order to go down in history as a multiple major champion. For Garcia, the stakes were even higher.  Not only was the Spaniard aiming to win his first major, he was also trying to prove that he had the mental resilience to triumph. What followed was an intense battle filled with drama and tension. Garcia started strongly with birdies on the first and third, opening up a three-shot lead on Rose after he bogeyed the fifth. But the Englishman replied with three straight birdies to rejoin his playing partner on eight under at the turn. Garcia bogeyed the 10th to give Rose the outright lead, then appeared to lose his composure when he pulled his tee shot into the trees on the par-five 13th. He was forced to take a one-shot penalty because of an unplayable lie, but scrambled well to save par.

                         This sparked his revival, A remarkable eagle on the par-five 15th - his first in 452 holes at Augusta - followed by a Rose birdie, meant the pair were tied on nine under with three to play. Garcia pushed a short birdie putt right on the par-three 16th after Rose had holed his to open a one-shot lead, only for the Englishman to bogey the 17th. Both players missed birdie putts on the last, Garcia from four feet, setting up the first Masters play-off between two European players, which Garcia nicked in fading light. ""It has been such a long time coming,"" said the world number 11, who will rise into the top 10 on Monday. ""I knew I was playing well. I felt the calmest I ever felt in a major."" While Garcia was being presented with the Green Jacket in the Augusta clubhouse, Rose was left rueing another near miss. The Olympic champion has not claimed a major since winning the 2013 US Open, but lifted himself into contention for a first Masters title with five birdies in the final seven holes on Saturday. But Rose, who also finished second behind Spieth in 2015, had to settle for a fifth top-10 finish at Augusta National. ""It is disappointing to come so close,"" said the world number 14. ""I felt in control until the end. ""But I'm really happy for Sergio. I'd love to be wearing the Green Jacket but if it wasn't me then I'm glad it is him."" World number two McIlroy's ambition of becoming only the sixth man to win all four majors must wait for at least another year. The 27-year-old, who has already won the Open, US Open and two US PGA Championship titles, battled back from three over par after eight holes on Thursday to finish three under after a closing 69. ""It wasn't quite good enough. I felt like I had an opportunity on Saturday to shoot something in the mid-60s which would have got me closer to the lead and I didn't quite do that,"" said McIlroy. ""I gave a decent account of myself and will come back next year and try again."" Casey, 39, carded four birdies in a bogey-free front nine to move into contention at four under, but could not improve that score as he shot 68 to earn his fourth top-10 finish at Augusta. South Africa's Schwartzel, the 2011 champion, holed five birdies in the final 10 holes to finish with a 68, while American Matt Kuchar aced the 16th - the only hole-in-one of the week - on his way to the day's joint best round of 67.

                         He finished tied fourth on five under with Belgian Thomas Pieters, who impressed on his Masters debut. Two-time major winner Spieth was hoping to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse at the 12th by winning his second Masters. But the 23-year-old American, who was already three over for the day and well down the leaderboard, saw his challenge completely disappear on the iconic par-three when he again knocked his tee-shot into the water guarding the green. It is the first time in his four Masters appearance the 2015 champion has not finished in the top two. Spieth's playing partner Fowler started one shot off the lead as he targeted his first major, only to rack up seven bogeys in a disappointing round. Fellow American Fred Couples, the 57-year-old who won the Masters in 1992, ended up tied 18th at one over. Ken Brown, BBC golf commentator: ""It was an electrifying final day. It was a duel of the highest quality, top sportsmanship and both Sergio and Justin take great credit. ""I think the golfing world thinks 'well, Justin has a major, it is time for Sergio to win one'. ""He thoroughly deserves it, he has been a champion golfer and in the top 20 of the world for virtually 20 years."" Sorry, this content is no longer available.

"Colombia peace deal: Soldier killed by renegade rebels Members of the left-wing Colombian Farc rebel group opposed to last year's historic peace agreement have killed a soldier in an attack in the south-east of the country, the army has said.  It said that dissidents targeted an army vehicle with an improvised explosive device.  Four other soldiers were wounded.  The attack has been condemned by President Juan Manuel Santos, who last year won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on the peace agreement.  The deal ended half a century of conflict but renegade Farc fighters have since clashed with other Farc members as well as government forces.  Colombia landslide: Farc rebels offer to help rebuild town The Farc rebel rapping for peace Dozens of rights activists killed in Colombia in 2016 The government and the Farc signed a peace agreement in November. Most Farc members are now inside or heading to one of 26 transition camps dotted around the country. They were set up as part of the historic peace deal which ended more than five decades of armed uprising.  But some Farc leaders have complained that, despite months of planning, most of the transition camps are still lacking the basic amenities they say they were promised. If the peace process goes to plan, the Farc will transform itself into a political force and its former fighters will re-enter society.  But, for many who have little or no formal education, that may be a huge challenge.

"Large protest in support of Hungary's Soros-backed university Thousands of people have taken part in a protest in Hungary to demand the abolition of laws which could force the closure of one of the country's most prestigious universities. New rules introduced by the government mean the Central European University (CEU) would be unable to award diplomas because it is registered in the US.   The university was founded by philanthropist George Soros. The legislation has already been rushed through parliament.  Demonstrators in the capital on Sunday want President Janos Ader not to sign the controversial legislation backed by the governing right-wing Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said the demonstrations would not cause the government to back down. ""There's no reason to,"" he said. ""It's possible for CEU to fulfil the requirements set out in the new law - they have a year to comply.""  Unlike last Sunday's protest, it was not just students who were out in the street - there were also lots of families, with some middle-aged and some elderly people in the crowd.  They marched peacefully in the bright spring sunshine, crossing Budapest's historic Chain Bridge as they headed towards Parliament. The protesters chanted slogans urging President Janos Ader to ask the Constitutional Court to review the new law adopted by parliament last week that is likely to lead to the closure of the CEU. BBC Budapest correspondent Nick Thorpe says it was probably the biggest anti-government protest in Budapest since Mr Orban came to power seven years ago.  The protesters took to the streets both to defend the CEU and protest against attempts by the government to pressure human rights and environmental groups which support refugees.  At least 50,000 people - organisers say as many as 80,000 protesters - took part in the demonstration.  The government passed amendments to the Higher Education Act last week which would make it impossible for the CEU to continue working in Budapest - 26 years after it was set up by Hungarian-born billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros.  The government opposes the liberal outlook of both the university and many non-governmental organisations (NGOs).  ""We do have a problem with George Soros  - or rather George Soros has a problem with us,"" said Mr Kovacs. ""He's been using his money and influence - through his NGOs - to put pressure on Hungary.""  The CEU has vowed to fight the legislation. The English-speaking university is ranked among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines. Mr Soros has a strained relationship with Mr Orban - a keen supporter of US President Donald Trump - who has accused the financier of wanting a role in Hungarian politics and supporting the influx of migrants into Europe.  Mr Orban recently claimed Hungary was ""under siege"" from asylum seekers. The prime minister won a scholarship sponsored by Mr Soros to study at Oxford university and the pair were allies in the days immediately following the fall of communism in 1989.",Monday 10 April 2017,10-Apr-17,Hungary rally defends Soros university,It was probably the biggest anti-government protest in Budapest since PM Viktor Orban came to power.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39549120
"Trump national security adviser KT McFarland 'to step down' President Donald Trump's deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, has been asked to step down after just three months, US media say. Ms McFarland, an ex-Fox News analyst, has reportedly been offered the role of ambassador to Singapore instead. It comes days after Mr Trump removed his senior strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council (NSC). The NSC advises the president on national security and foreign affairs. Mr Bannon's appointment in January raised fears that the circle of top advisers was being politicised. Decoding the Trump 'war room' photograph Bannon loses National Security Council seat Analysts say the latest moves show Mr Trump's new national security adviser, Lt Gen HR McMaster, reshaping the NSC team appointed by his predecessor. The previous national security adviser, Lt Gen Michael Flynn, was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job, after it emerged he had misled the vice-president over his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the US. Ms McFarland was a favourite of Mr Flynn. According to the New York Times, she did not endear herself to NSC staff by mentioning at one meeting that she was wearing Ivanka Trump shoes and telling them early on that they needed to ""make America great again"", echoing the president's campaign slogan.",Monday 10 April 2017,10-Apr-17,Top Trump security aide 'to step down',"Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland is asked to become Singapore ambassador, US media say.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39546360
"Stockholm attack suspect was refused residency The suspect behind the Stockholm truck attack had been facing deportation and had extremist sympathies, Swedish police say. The 39-year-old Uzbek man - named in Swedish media as Rakhmat Akilov - is suspected of having driven a truck into a city department store on Friday. His application for residency was rejected in June last year and he was being sought by immigration officials. Meanwhile, a second suspect has been placed under formal arrest. Police, who have not formally named Mr Akilov as the first suspect, said they were investigating the second suspect for a ""terrorist crime [by committing] murder"". However, Reuters news agency said the person was arrested on ""a lower degree of suspicion"" than the first suspect. Police have interviewed more than 500 people over the incident, Sweden's TT news agency reports. On Sunday, people gathered in central Stockholm for a ""Lovefest"" vigil against terrorism, and laid flowers outside the Ahlens shop in tribute. More than 20,000 people attended the vigil, AFP reported, citing city officials. City mayor Karin Wanngard told the crowds: ""Terror cannot win... instead we shall think of the kindness and openness that characterises our city."" Mr Akilov had applied for permanent residency in 2014, but this was rejected, and in December 2016 he was given four weeks to leave the country, police chief Jonas Hysing told a press conference.  The suspect then disappeared, and police began searching for him, Mr Hysing added.

"Vimy Ridge centenary: Thousands of Canadians mark battle's anniversary More than 20,000 Canadians have travelled to Europe to mark the centenary of one of the country's defining moments - the Battle of Vimy Ridge during World War One. About 3,600 Canadians died in the battle in northern France, that began on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. It was the first time different Canadian military divisions had fought together under one command. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paid tribute to those who fought. ""The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a turning point in the First World War and for Canada, when Canadians acted - and fought - as one,"" he said. Having laid flowers at the site of the battle earlier on Sunday, Mr Trudeau attended a commemorative ceremony with French President Francois Hollande, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Queen also sent a message to Canadians in French and English commending their soldiers for the sacrifice they made. The battle of Vimy Ridge, near Arras, was part of a wider British-led offensive that acted as a diversion from a French attack to the south, and proved successful in its aim.  The battle across a 7km (4.3-mile) ridge began in heavy snow and sleet and lasted four days. Four Canadians went on to earn the Victoria Cross, the British military's highest award for bravery. Success at Vimy Ridge was the result of intense training over several months, and despite the heavy losses, helped forge Canada's identity on a global scale only 50 years after it had become an independent dominion.  Two years later, Canada was one of the signatories to the Treaty of Versailles, formally ending the war. Among those attending the ceremony in Vimy on Sunday was Ken Piggott, a retired Army captain from Nova Scotia.

"Hijacked ship's crew rescued from pirates near Somalia Nineteen crew members have been freed from a ship captured by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Maritime officials received an alert on Saturday that pirates had boarded the timber-carrying ship about 75 miles (120km) from the coast of Yemen. Ships from three countries diverted to its path. A Chinese team boarded the vessel early on Sunday. The first hijacking by Somali pirates in five years occurred last month, but this is the second raid since then. A spokesman for UK Marine Trade Operations (UKMTO) in Dubai, who co-ordinate safe passage for merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden, said all on board the hijacked ship were safe and heading to an unnamed destination under escort. The UKMTO said the crew was from Syria, but a statement by India's ministry of defence said they were from the Philippines. Maritime piracy threatens to return Reports in India said the hijacked ship was travelling between the ports of Kelang in Malaysia and Aden in Yemen. The UKMTO said navy ships from India, China and Pakistan (the last operating as part of an international combined task force) changed course to approach the Tuvalu-flagged ship soon after the alert was raised. The crew had locked themselves in the citadel, a safe room inside the ship designed to protect those on board from pirates. The crew from the Chinese ship boarded the hijacked ship at dawn today, freeing those on board. India's military said it is believed the hijackers fled the ship during the night. Piracy in the waters off Somalia and Yemen peaked in 2011, with more than 200 attacks. But after five years with no raids, an oil tanker was seized and held for ransom by Somali pirates in early March and there have been a number of attempted seizures since then.",Monday 10 April 2017,10-Apr-17,Crew rescued from ship seized by pirates,The ship was hijacked off Yemen by Somali pirates on Saturday but those on board are now safe.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39543768
"Norway raises terror threat levels after Oslo bomb find Norway's intelligence services have raised the national terror threat level, after a homemade bomb was found in the centre of the capital Oslo. The risk of an attack was now ""probable"" rather than ""possible"", the security services said. On Saturday, police cordoned off a large part of Gronland in central Oslo, and carried out a controlled detonation on an explosive device. A 17-year-old Russian citizen has been arrested. His lawyer told local media that he denied any wrongdoing and that his actions were ""a boy's prank"". The teenager moved to Norway in 2010 and had applied for asylum, Reuters news agency reports. Benedicte Bjornland, head of the Police Security Service, said: ""It's not clear whether the 17-year-old young man intended to commit a terrorist attack.""  Recent attacks in France, Germany, the UK, Russia and Sweden were ""having a contagious effect in Norway"" and could lead to copycat attacks, Ms Bjornland added. The raised threat level will remain in force for two months. The explosive device in Gronland was capable of causing only limited damage, police said.  Police were already on alert after an attack in Sweden on Friday. A truck ploughed into a Stockholm department store, killing four people and injuring 15 more.

"Syria war: US missiles 'took out 20% of aircraft' A US air strike in response to a suspected chemical attack damaged or destroyed 20% of Syria's operational aircraft, the US has said. Defence Secretary James Mattis said Syria would be ""ill-advised ever again to use chemical weapons"". Syria has denied a chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun last week that left 89 people dead. G7 nations are meeting in Italy to discuss policy and how to persuade Russia to abandon its Syrian ally. The US fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase last Thursday, following the suspected chemical attack a day before. Mr Mattis said the ""measured response"" by the US had ""resulted in the damage or destruction of fuel and ammunition sites, air defence capabilities and 20% of Syria's operational aircraft"". He added: ""The Syrian government has lost the ability to refuel or rearm aircraft at Shayrat airfield and at this point, use of the runway is of idle military interest."" The Syrian military admitted significant material damage but a Russian defence ministry spokesman said only six Syrian Air Force MiG-23s, plus a number of buildings, were destroyed and that only 23 of the missiles had reached Shayrat. Mr Mattis said the strike had shown the US would ""not passively stand by while [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad] murders innocent people with chemical weapons"". White House spokesman Sean Spicer said further strikes were on the table. ""The sight of people being gassed and blown away by barrel bombs ensures that if we see this kind of action again, we hold open the possibility of future action,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Associated Press news agency quoted a senior US official as saying that the Russians knew of the chemical attack, because a drone had been flying over a hospital in Khan Sheikhoun as victims sought help. Hours later a jet bombed the hospital in what the US believed was an attempt to cover up the attack, the agency said. Why was Shayrat airbase bombed? The two-day meeting of foreign ministers in Lucca in Tuscany is aiming to hammer out a unified approach to the Syria conflict. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the message from the meeting should be clear - that Russian President Vladimir Putin must be made to abandon his support for Mr Assad. ""He's toxifying the reputation of Russia by his continual association with a guy who has flagrantly poisoned his own people,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the meeting would be ""discussing the possibility of further sanctions certainly on some of the Syrian military figures and indeed on some of the Russian military figures who have been involved in co-ordinating the Syrian military efforts"". Decoding Russia's response to Johnson's cancelled trip Russia is already under a raft of sanctions imposed by the US and EU in response to the annexation of Crimea and the crisis in eastern Ukraine. These would be the first sanctions against Russian figures over Syria if they were to be adopted, but it is far from clear they will be. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson heads from Lucca to Moscow on Tuesday, and will want to confront the Russians with a unified set of demands. However the G7, which groups Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the UK along with the United States - with the EU also represented - is still seeking clarification of Washington's policy on Syria. Mr Tillerson strongly criticised Russia for failing to prevent Syria from carrying out the suspected chemical attack. But he also said there had been ""no change to our military posture"" in Syria following the US  airbase strike and that Washington's ""first priority"" in Syria was to defeat so-called Islamic State (IS). Russia says the US has failed to provide evidence that Syria has chemical weapons. Russia and Iran, President Assad's key military backers, are also threatening retaliation if there are any further American air strikes. Is Trump slipping into Syria quagmire?

"Alabama 'Luv Guv' Robert Bentley quits over relationship with aide Alabama's governor has quit over his relationship with an aide in one of the state's biggest political scandals. Robert Bentley, a two-term Republican, stepped down as lawmakers began impeachment proceedings against him. The tawdry saga has seen his suggestive text and phone messages with a former adviser splashed across media. The state ethics commission last week found reason to believe he had committed four felony crimes involving possible misuse of state funds.  Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey, also a Republican, was sworn in to replace him shortly after his resignation. Mr Bentley, a 74-year-old former Baptist deacon and dermatologist, was last week defying calls to step down, including from leaders of his own party. But a 3,000-page report on Friday from the Alabama House judiciary committee's attorney said Mr Bentley had demanded state officials help him cover up an ""inappropriate relationship"". He had also ""encouraged an atmosphere of intimidation"" to hide the scandal, according to the findings. Mr Bentley insisted his relationship with Rebekah Caldwell Mason, a former TV news reporter and married mother of three, was never physical. But the report said security personnel had seen her ""leaving the [governor's] office with her hair tousled and her clothing in disarray"". In texts between the governor and Mrs Mason, one from her phone said: ""You handsome, wonderful, amazing, delicious, funny, sweet man."" Mr Bentley, who was first elected in 2010, replied: ""You are wonderful my sweet love. I love you.""  In another exchange, the two discussed their desire to elope.  The governor also mistakenly sent his wife, Dianne Bentley, a text message that said, ""I love you Rebekah"". In March 2014 Mrs Bentley secretly recorded an explicit phone conversation between her husband and a woman he addressed as Rebekah. ""When I stand behind you,"" he  is heard saying in a recording that was leaked to local media, ""and I put my arms around you, and I put my hands on your breasts, and I put my hands (unintelligible) and just pull you real close. I love that, too."" Mrs Bentley filed for divorce in August 2015, saying the 50-year marriage had suffered an irreparable breakdown. Mrs Mason, whose husband also worked for the governor, resigned in March last year as the scandal emerged. Mr Bentley's resignation does not draw a line under the scandal.

"United Airlines: Passenger forcibly removed from flight Videos showing a man being violently removed from a United Airlines flight have provoked an outcry on social media. The footage taken inside the airliner shows a man being violently pulled out of his seat and dragged down the aisle as passengers prepared to take off from Chicago to Louisville on Sunday evening. The airline in question - United - has tweeted an apology for what happened and says it is investigating. One 50-second clip of the incident on Twitter was re-tweeted 16,000 times since it was posted that day.  Jayse D Anspach, who posted the footage, tweeted: ""#United overbooked and wanted four of us to volunteer to give up our seats for personnel that needed to be at work the next day."" ""No one volunteered, so United decided to choose for us. They chose an Asian doctor and his wife.""

""Ten minutes later, the doctor runs back into the plane with a bloody face, clings to a post in the back, chanting, ""I need to go home.""

We are all shaky and so disgusted."" Thousands of Facebook comments have been posted about what happened.   One person wrote: ""This is infuriating"" Another posted: ""OMG So sad to see someone being treated like this. I wont fly United ever again."" But another felt the video raised some unanswered questions.  ""There has to be more to this story,"" he said. ""Usually when a flight is overbooked they offer free flight vouchers to those willing to change flights or go on standby and a couple of people will jump at those as their travel plans may be flexible.""  ""I feel like this specific incident HAS to be deeper than what we are seeing in this video,"" he added. In a statement United airlines told the BBC: ""Flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville was overbooked.""  ""After our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate,"" the airline added.

I apologise for having to re-accommodate these customers."" ""Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened.

"San Bernardino shooting: Boy, 8, and two adults dead at California primary school A man walked into a US primary school and fatally shot his wife in her class, also killing a child in the crossfire, before turning the gun on himself. Armed with a .357 Magnum revolver, Cedric Anderson, 53, entered the school in San Bernardino, California, as a visitor before Monday's attack. He killed estranged wife, Karen Elaine Smith, 53, a teacher, and fatally wounded Jonathan Martinez, eight. Police described the incident as a ""murder-suicide"". The shooting happened at 10:30 local time (17:30 GMT) at North Park Elementary School, 60 miles (96km) east of Los Angeles.  The gunman kept his weapon concealed as he entered the school before opening fire in the classroom where 15 children with special needs were being taught, authorities said. ""He simply said he was there to drop something off there with his wife,"" San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan told a news conference. The couple married in January this year but had been separated for several weeks, Mr Burguan added. Another student who was caught in the crossfire, a nine-year-old, was in hospital in a stable condition, the Los Angeles Times reported. San Bernardino Police Lt Mike Madden said: ""This does appear to have been a murder-suicide with both male adult and female adult victim succumbing to injuries, with the male succumbing to a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""  The school, which has around 500 students, was immediately evacuated. They were transferred by bus to nearby Cajon High School, where they were reunited with their parents.

"Triple murder suspect jumps in 'apparent suicide' at Ohio courthouse An Ohio man suspected of killing a 10-year-old girl and her grandparents has jumped to his death at a courthouse in an ""an apparent suicide"", police said. Robert Seman was accused of molesting the girl before killing the family members, according to Mahoning County Sheriff Jerry Greene. Surveillance footage showed Mr Seman walking with two officers before he jumped off a fourth floor balcony.  He was leaving the courthouse after a status hearing before his trial.  Mr Seman was accused of setting fire to a Youngstown home in March 2015, killing Corinne Gump and her grandparents, Bill and Judy Schmidt.

"Russian arrested in Spain 'over mass hacking' Spanish police have arrested a Russian programmer following US allegations of large-scale hacking.  Pyotr Levashov was held in Barcelona on Friday and is remanded in custody. Spanish police said Mr Levashov controlled a botnet called Kelihos, hacking information and installing malicious software in hundreds of thousands of computers. The arrest was part of a ""complex inquiry carried out in collaboration with the FBI"", police said. Mr Levashov is subject to a US international arrest warrant and a Spanish court will hear whether he can be extradited. Much of his alleged activity involved ransomware - blocking a computer's access to certain information and demanding a ransom for its release. Mr Levashov's wife Maria told Russian broadcaster RT that the arrest had been made in connection with allegations that Russians had hacked the US presidential election. She said Spanish police had told her the arrest was in connection with ""a virus which appears to have been created by my husband and is linked to [Donald] Trump's victory"". However, Agence France-Presse news agency quoted a source close to the matter in Washington as saying that Mr Levashov's detention was ""not tied to anything involving allegations of Russian interference with the US election"". A US intelligence report released in January alleged that Vladimir Putin had tried to help Mr Trump to victory, allegations strongly denied the Russian president. Mr Trump later commented that the outcome of the election had not been affected. Several cybersecurity experts, including Brian Krebs, have also linked Mr Levashov to a Russian spam kingpin, who uses the alias Peter Severa.",Tuesday 11 April 2017,11-Apr-17,Russian arrested 'over mass hacking',"Spanish police say he ran the Kelihos botnet, hacking information and installing malicious software.",http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39553250

"Pulitzers: Investigation into Trump's philanthropy wins An investigation into Donald Trump's pledges to charitable causes during the US presidential election campaign has won a Pulitzer prize. Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold's articles ""created a model for transparent journalism"" and cast doubt on Mr Trump's assertions of generosity, the Pulitzer board said. He also revealed Mr Trump's obscene comments about women on a 2005 tape. The Pulitzers are the most prestigious prizes in US journalism. Mr Fahrenthold began asking questions after Mr Trump promised to donate $6m (£4.8m) to military veterans' organisations and found that, while that pledge did get fulfilled, many previous claims of philanthropic activities had been exaggerated, the Washington Post newspaper said. Other Pulitzer winners included The New York Daily News and ProPublica, an online platform specialising in investigative journalism, for uncovering police abuse of eviction rules that saw hundreds of people, mostly poor and from ethnic minority backgrounds, forced out of their homes. The New York Times staff won the international reporting prize for articles on Russian President Vladimir Putin's efforts to project Russia's power abroad. The same newspaper's C J Chivers won the feature writing award for his piece detailing a US marine's post-war descent into violence. Freelance photographer Daniel Berehulak won the Pulitzer for breaking news photography for images published in the New York Times showing the results of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs. The Pulitzers have been awarded since 1917.

She was in a patrol car in Barcelona on 8 March - International Women's Day - but rushed off to a toilet for 5-10 minutes because she was menstruating.  An officer reported her for doing so. A witness quoted by El Pais said the policewoman explained her brief absence to the officer, a lieutenant, who shouted at her: ""Don't tell me fibs, you go to the toilet before or after the patrol, but not during it."" Faced with the official reprimand, the policewoman decided to activate the Guardia Civil's procedure for alleged harassment at work.

"Ed Sheeran settles Photograph copyright infringement claim Ed Sheeran has settled a $20m (£13.8m) copyright infringement claim against him in the US, over his hit song Photograph. Songwriters Thomas Leonard and Martin Harrington sued the singer last June, claiming his hit ballad had a similar structure to their song, Amazing. A lawyer for the pair confirmed to the BBC the claim had now been settled. Leonard and Harrington's track was released by former X Factor winner Matt Cardle in 2012. On Friday, court papers were lodged dismissing the case ""with prejudice"", stipulating that a California federal court would enforce the terms of an agreement.  Richard Busch, who represented Harrington and Leonard, would not comment on the settlement terms.  A spokeswoman for Sheeran's record company, Atlantic Records, told the BBC it did not comment on stories relating to copyright issues. The songwriters originally claimed the chorus of the two songs shared 39 identical notes, with similarities ""instantly recognisable to the ordinary observer"". They submitted the chord structures for both tracks in court documents. Mr Busch is the same lawyer who won a case for the family of the late soul singer Marvin Gaye. He successfully sued Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams for copyright infringement last year over their single Blurred Lines, winning a $7.4m (£5.1m) settlement.

"Decomposing bat found in Walmart salad prompts rabies tests Walmart has issued a recall on a packaged salad after Florida customers found a decomposing bat inside the box.  The two customers ate some of the Organic Marketside Spring Mix salad before the bat was found, officials said. They have been tested for rabies.  The company said customers who may have already purchased the pre-packaged greens, which are sold mainly in southern states, should discard them.  Walmart also said customers can request a full refund for the product.  The two people began eating the salad before they discovered the bat, which was found in a ""deteriorated condition"", according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The bat was sent to a CDC lab and tested for rabies.  ""Both people report being in good health and neither has any signs of rabies,"" the CDC said in a statement. The agency also advised anyone who may have already eaten one of the affected salads and found ""animal material"" to contact their local health department immediately.  But people ""who have eaten the recalled salad and did not find animal material are not at risk and do not need to contact their health department"", the CDC added.  The salads, which bear the production code G089B19, are exclusively sold at Walmart stores throughout the southeastern US.  The company said it worked quickly with officials to remove the entire batch of salads from store shelves, and only one line of its products had been affected.

"Borussia Dortmund football team bus hit by explosions Three explosions have hit a bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund football team to their home Champions League quarter-final match against Monaco. In a news conference, the head of Dortmund police said it was a targeted attack on the team. Player Marc Bartra underwent an operation after breaking a bone in his wrist. No other players were hurt. The state prosecutor said a letter found near the scene was being examined as part of the investigation. The match was postponed until 18:45 local time (16:45 GMT) on Wednesday. Pictures from the scene showed the bus's windows broken and tyres burst in the blasts. Dortmund police said that ""three explosive charges had detonated"" at Hoechsten outside the city at about 19:00 local time. The first indications were that this was an ""attack with serious explosives"", they  said. Fans at the 80,000-capacity Signal Iduna Park were told to stay there until it was safe to leave. The stadium was later evacuated safely and police thanked the fans for their co-operation. ""As many officers as possible"" would be deployed for tomorrow's rescheduled game, they said. Monaco fans were praised for their chants of support for Dortmund. Social media also carried offers from Dortmund residents to Monaco fans in need of a bed for the night on #bedforawayfans. Borussia Dortmund said in a statement: ""Shortly after the departure of the Borussia Dortmund team bus from the hotel to the stadium there was an incident. The bus has been damaged in two places."" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said: ""The whole team is in a state of shock, you can't get pictures like that out of your head. ""I hope the team will be in a position to be able to compete tomorrow on the pitch. In a crisis situation like this, Borussia pulls together."" One of the Dortmund players, Mathias Ginter, was involved in the Germany-France match that was targeted in the terror attacks in Paris on 13 November, 2015. Another present in Paris, Andre Schurrle, was injured for the Monaco match. FC Barcelona, Bartra's former club, tweeted: ""All of our support to @MarcBartra, @BVB and their fans."" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also tweeted his support, wishing Bartra a quick recovery. Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football organising body condemned the incident and wished Bartra a ""speedy recovery"".

Oscar Munoz said he ""continues to be disturbed"" by the incident, captured on a video that went viral on Twitter. He said the company would ""fix what's broken so it never happens again"". The family of the passenger, David Dao, issued a statement expressing gratitude for the ""outpouring of support"". He is undergoing treatment at a Chicago hospital. The footage taken inside the airliner shows a man being pulled out of his seat and dragged, screaming, down the aisle. He is later seen with blood on his face. The flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, on Sunday evening had been fully booked, United spokesman Jonathan Guerin told USA Today newspaper. The airline wanted to get four passengers to leave the flight to make room for four staff members who were needed in Louisville the next day. United had previously described the flight as overbooked. United Airline's public relations disaster Why do airlines overbook? Three passengers agreed to leave the plane. But Dr Dao said he worked in a hospital and needed to see his patients the next day, an eyewitness tweeted. A video that appears to show him dazed and with blood around his mouth, saying ""just kill me"", having run back on the plane, also emerged online. Earlier, Mr Munoz had defended employees' conduct and said the passenger had been ""disruptive and belligerent"". Employees were ""left with no choice but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight"", he added. He came under intense criticism online and the incident reached the ears of the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, who called it ""troubling"". Would you change your flight for money? The statement released on behalf of Dr Dao said the family ""wants the world to know that they are very appreciative of the outpouring of prayers, concern and support they have received"". It said the family was at present only concerned with Dr Dao's medical care and would not be making further statements until he was discharged. One of the aviation security officers involved in removing Dr Dao from the plane has been ""placed on leave"", the Chicago Department of Aviation said, and his actions were ""obviously not condoned by the department"". It also said it would carry out a review into the incident, which it said was ""not in accordance with our standard operating procedure"".

"White House gaffe on Hitler and chemical weapons draws ire White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has apologised after declaring that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons during World War Two. ""I mistakenly used an inappropriate and insensitive reference about the Holocaust and there is no comparison,"" he said. ""For that I apologise. It was a mistake to do that."" Critics pointed out gas was used to kill Jews and others in the Holocaust.  Mr Spicer had been criticising Russia's support for the Syrian government. The White House says Russia has been trying to deflect blame for a chemical weapons attack that killed 89 people.  US intelligence reports say the Syrian government used chemical weapons during air strikes. Syria denies this and Moscow has instead blamed rebel forces, which it says were storing chemical weapons which were hit in the raids. The US responded by launching nearly 60 missiles on a Syrian military base.  Spicer had choice - apologise or dig Why does everyone keep making Nazi comparisons? Mr Spicer's comments, made during the Jewish festival of Passover, drew looks of astonishment from journalists. Mr Spicer was asked to clarify his remarks during the news conference and garbled his words during the response. ""I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he [Hitler] was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Asshad [sic] is doing."" He added: ""There was not, in the, he brought them in to the Holocaust centres, I understand that, what I'm saying, in the way that Assad used them, where he went into towns dropped them down to innocent, into the middle of towns, it was brought to, so the use of it, and I appreciate the clarification, that was not the intent."" But the comments sparked backlash online, where Twitter users quickly condemned the remarks and noted that Hitler used gas to kill Jews, German citizens and political opponents of the Nazi Party.  Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, was among those to rebuke Mr Spicer.  Some users also criticised Mr Spicer for referring to concentration camps as ""Holocaust centres"". Senator Ben Cardin weighed in on Twitter, saying: ""Someone get @PressSec a refresher history course on Hitler state #Icantbelievehereallysaidthat"". He added: ""Sean Spicer: Really? The term you were looking for was concentration camps"".  The Anne Frank Center called on President Donald Trump to sack Mr Spicer. Executive director Steven Goldstein said: ""On Passover no less, Sean Spicer has engaged in Holocaust denial, the most offensive form of fake news imaginable, by denying Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death.""  His statement added that the remarks were ""the most evil slur upon a group of people"" ever heard from a White House press secretary, and he should be fired. In January, the White House was criticised for issuing a statement to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which did not mention Jews, Judaism or anti-Semitism.  White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus later defended the statement, arguing Mr Trump has family members who are Jewish and ""there was no harm or ill will or offence intended by any of that"".",Wednesday 12 April 2017,12-Apr-17,White House remark on Hitler draws ire,Press secretary Sean Spicer backpedals after saying Hitler did not use chemical weapons.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39572902
"Nigeria road safety commander cut hair of female employees Nigeria's road safety organisation has disciplined a senior commander after he was filmed punishing female employees by cutting off their long hair. Photos showing the male commander taking a pair of scissors to the women's hair at an inspection parade sparked outrage online. There are rules governing the hairstyles of female staff at the Federal Road Safety Corp (FRSC). But a spokesman said the officer's action was ""outside"" the FRSC mandate. Lauretta Onochie, an aide to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, condemned the haircuts as a ""humiliation of women"" in a post on Twitter. Andrew Kumapayi, regional commander for the FRSC in the southern Rivers State, reportedly carried out the punishment at an early-morning parade in the city of Port Harcourt on Monday. He has not given any comment.   An official guide for female staff at FRSC parades says they must ""maintain a hairstyle that can be tucked into their beret"", but does not mention a ban on long hair. A Facebook post containing photos of the incident has now been deleted from the organisation's official page, though the pictures have been shared thousands of times on social media. The post said that Mr Kumapayi was carrying out a ""hair, uniform and fingernails inspection"" of staff. Other officers involved in the incident had also been recalled, FRSC spokesman Bisi Kazeem told the state-run News Agency of Nigeria.

"Taiwan bans slaughter of cats and dogs for human consumption Taiwan's parliament has approved a bill banning the slaughter of cats and dogs for human consumption.  The bill also prohibits those using a car or motorbike from pulling their pets alongside them on a lead as they travel. Anyone caught breaching the order faces a large fine or up to two years in prison - and having their names and photographs made public. The measures were introduced to improve the country's animal protection laws. The move on Tuesday is a landmark amendment to Taiwan's Animal Protection Act, and is the first of its kind in Asia. In 2001, Taiwan passed legislation banning the sale of meat and fur of pets such as cats and dogs for what it described as ""economic purposes"". Dog meat was once regularly consumed on the island, but the animal is now more likely to be considered a member of the family. Last year, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen adopted three retired guide dogs to live along with her two cats, Cookie and A-Tsai. Ms Tsai, who is Taiwan's first female leader, attracted attention at the time with what was dubbed the country's new ""first family"".

"Katty Kay: Spicer had choice - apologise or dig It's never clear to me why it's so hard for people to say sorry. It's a simple word, just two syllables and its positive impact is enormous.  But to be effective the ""sorry"" needs to come fast and be said sincerely. Take too long or add a caveat and your apology loses its power.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer and United Airlines chief executive Oscar Munoz could both go to apology classes today.  Mr Munoz came up with his sincere apology late today - 48 hours and three attempts too late.  He did finally say he was ""deeply"" sorry for the terrible way a passenger was treated on a United flight, and said the airline took full responsibility.  But since this followed a previous statement that was totally defensive, suggesting the forced ""re-accommodation"" was the passenger's own fault for being belligerent, Mr Munoz's ultimate ""sorry"" just didn't sound so sincere.  If Mr Munoz had come out on Monday morning with the statement he finally put out on Tuesday afternoon, he'd be in a much better PR position. He had to say sorry eventually; all he got by waiting was a slump in the company's share price and millions of angry customers.  Sean Spicer also put out a statement clarifying his offensive, and incorrect, press briefing remark that even Hitler ""didn't sink"" to using chemical weapons. It was probably a slip; I doubt very much that Mr Spicer is a Holocaust denier. But his statement missed the ""sorry"" standard. In fact it may have made things worse because it bizarrely seemed to infer that the millions who died in Hitler's gas chambers weren't innocent.  Mr Spicer later came out on CNN to apologise when the groundswell of outrage reached a crescendo. ""I mistakenly used an inappropriate and insensitive reference to the Holocaust,"" he said.  ""For that, I apologise. It was a mistake to do that."" Such a quick, full apology is rare from public figures, especially in the White House, and raises the question - does Mr Spicer still have the full support of the president?  Politicians live in mortal terror of ever saying they are sorry about anything, because that would suggest they have been wrong. It is often a trait of powerful people not to want to be seen to back down. But with the Anne Frank Center already calling for Mr Spicer's immediate dismissal, the press secretary is under pressure. A position he may be getting rather used to.

"France migrants: Hundreds without shelter after Grand-Synthe camp fire French authorities have been scrambling to find shelter for 1,500 migrants left homeless after fire destroyed the Grande-Synthe camp near Dunkirk. About 500 people have been accommodated in gymnasiums but the rest, including unaccompanied children as young as 12, have been sleeping outside, NGOs say. Candidates in the French presidential election have called for changes in migration policy. Migration has been a key issue in the run-up to the poll on 23 April. A spokesman for the centrist candidate, Emmanuel Macron, said an agreement with Britain that left the French acting ""as its border guards"" would have to be reviewed during Brexit negotiations.  His far-right rival Marine le Pen called a fight between Kurds and Afghans just before the blaze started as a sign of migratory chaos.  The Grande-Synthe camp was home to one of the largest groups of migrants attempting to reach the UK following last October's destruction of the ""Jungle"" camp near Calais, about 40 km (25 miles) away.  The number of people there had almost doubled and the arrival of more Afghans increased tensions with Kurds living in the camp, reports said. Five people were hurt in a knife fight between Afghans and Kurds which was broken up by riot police. Another migrant was in a serious condition after being hit by a vehicle on a nearby motorway, Reuters reported. A local official said the fires had been started deliberately following the clashes. Sixty firefighters fought the blaze but it destroyed 70% of the densely packed wooden huts and left the site unusable. France has reinforced its police presence in the area and Belgium has upped its border patrols to prevent migrants from entering its territory, the Belga news agency reported. The French authorities have said they will speed up admission to reception centres for migrants wanting to apply for asylum in France. Campaigners have called on both the French and British governments to improve legal migration routes. Last week, some Grand-Synthe residents tried to block a nearby highway with tree trunks and branches in an attempt to stop traffic and clamber onto trucks, Reuters reported.",Wednesday 12 April 2017,12-Apr-17,Hundreds lose shelter in France camp fire,"Unaccompanied children as young as 12 are among those sleeping outside, NGOs say.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39573736
"US accuses Russia of covering up Syria chemical attack Russia has tried to deflect blame for a deadly chemical attack away from the Syrian government, the US has said. White House officials told reporters that intelligence reports confirmed that Syria was responsible for the incident, which killed 89 people. Syria has denied it and Moscow has instead blamed rebel forces. The US fired 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase in retaliation, but the global community is divided over how to respond. On Tuesday, senior White House officials discussed a four-page declassified report that says Syria and Russia have used ""false narratives"" to try to confuse the international community. ""Russia's allegations fit with a pattern of deflecting blame from the [Syrian] regime and attempting to undermine the credibility of its opponents,"" said an official. The report said the government of President Bashar al-Assad carried out an air strike on 4 April in Idlib province to hit rebels in the area. A chemical agent was flown by aircraft that departed from the Shayrat airfield, the document said. ""I think it's clear that the Russians are trying to cover up what happened there,"" one of the officials said. But they refused to comment on whether Russia colluded with Syria on the attack or knew about it in advance, a point echoed later by the US secretary of defence. James Mattis added: ""There is no doubt the Syrian regime is responsible for the decision to attack and for the attack itself."" His comments came just after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Russia to challenge the Kremlin over its support for Mr Assad.  A two-day summit of G7 ministers in Italy ended in division over Syria, as the UK proposed - without success - sanctions against Syrian and Russian military figures over the chemical attack.",Wednesday 12 April 2017,12-Apr-17,US accuses Russia of cover-up in Syria,"Russia has tried to deflect blame for a deadly chemical attack away from the Syrian government, the US has said.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39573526
"African migrants sold in Libya 'slave markets', IOM says Africans trying to reach Europe are being sold by their captors in ""slave markets"" in Libya, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says. Victims told IOM that after being detained by people smugglers or militia groups, they were taken to town squares or car parks to be sold. Migrants with skills like painting or tiling would fetch higher prices, the head of the IOM in Libya told the BBC. Libya has been in chaos since the 2011 Nato-backed ousting of Muammar Gaddafi. Hundreds of young sub-Saharan African men have been caught up in the so-called slave markets, according to the IOM report. A Senegalese migrant, who was not named to protect his identity, said that he had been sold at one such market in the southern Libyan city of Sabha, before being taken to a makeshift prison where more than 100 migrants were being held hostage. He said that migrants held at the facility were told to call their families, who would be asked for money to pay for their release, and some were beaten while on the phone to allow relatives to hear them being tortured. He described ""dreadful"" conditions where migrants were forced to survive on limited food supplies, with those unable to pay either killed or left to starve, the report adds. Another witness, who was able to raise the funds needed for his release after nine months, was later taken to hospital with severe malnutrition, weighing just 5.5 stone (35 kg). Women, too, were bought by private Libyan clients and brought to homes where they were forced to be sex slaves, the witness said. The IOM's chief of mission for Libya, Othman Belbeisi, told the BBC that those sold into slavery found themselves priced according to their abilities. ""Apparently they don't have money and their families cannot pay the ransom, so they are being sold to get at least a minimum benefit from that,"" he said.  ""The price is definitely different depending on your qualifications, for example if you can do painting or tiles or some specialised work then the price gets higher."" An IOM staff member in Niger said they confirmed the reports of auctions in Libya with several other migrants who had escaped. ""They all confirmed the risks of been sold as slaves in squares or garages in Sabha, either by their drivers or by locals who recruit the migrants for daily jobs in town, often in construction. ""Later, instead of paying them, [they] sell their victims to new buyers."" Some migrants, mainly Nigerians, Ghanaians and Gambians are forced to work ""as guards in the ransom houses or in the 'market' itself"", the IOM employee added. The organisation has called the emergence of these markets ""a disturbing new trend in the already dire situation for migrants in Libya"". In February, the UN children's agency Unicef released a report documenting - in sometimes horrific detail - stories of slavery, violence and sexual abuse experienced by large numbers of vulnerable children travelling from Libya to Italy. The report, A Deadly Journey for Children, said that almost 26,000 children - most of them unaccompanied - crossed the Mediterranean in 2016, many of them suffering abuse at the hands of smugglers and traffickers.

"Charlie Gard case: Doctors can withdraw baby's life support Doctors can withdraw life support from a sick baby with a rare genetic condition against his parents' wishes, a High Court judge has ruled. Specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital said eight-month-old Charlie Gard has irreversible brain damage and should be moved to palliative care. His parents Connie Yates and Chris Gard, from London, had wanted to take him to the US for a treatment trial. They said they were ""devastated"" by the decision but intended to appeal. Their solicitor, Laura Hobey-Hamsher, said they could not understand why Mr Justice Francis had not ""at least given Charlie the chance of treatment"". She said the couple would take further advice on challenging the ruling once their legal team had studied it. They have three weeks to lodge an appeal. Hospital bosses said they would continue to provide life-support treatment until a decision about an appeal had been made. In his judgement, Mr Justice Francis said he made the decision with the ""heaviest of hearts"" but with ""complete conviction"" that it was in the best interests of the child. He paid tribute to Charlie's parents for ""their brave and dignified campaign on his behalf"" and ""their absolute dedication to their wonderful boy, from the day that he was born"". The judge, who had visited Charlie in hospital, added: ""I know this is the darkest day for Charlie's parents...my heart goes out to them. ""I only hope in time they will come to accept it is in Charlie's best interests to let him slip away peacefully, and not put him through more pain and suffering."" Charlie, who was born on 4 August, has a disorder called mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare disease which affects the genetic building blocks that give energy to cells. It causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage.  His parents, of Bedfont, west London, had told the Family Division of the High Court they wanted to give their baby ""one chance of life"". In their bid to fund the treatment abroad they set up a crowdfunding campaign which has raised in excess of £1.25m from more than 80,000 donors. A GoFundMe spokesman said it will ""be speaking privately to the family"" about what would happen to the money raised. Mr Gard was ""shaking and visibly very upset"" as he waited for the judgment, BBC News correspondent Helena Lee, who was in court, said. When the judge ruled the treatment could be withdrawn, he shouted out ""no"". Both he and Ms Yates broke down in tears and buried their heads in their hands. They left the court building without listening to the judge's full reasoning behind his judgement. During five days of evidence, Mr Justice Francis heard competing arguments over what should happen to Charlie. Debra Powell QC, representing hospital bosses, had told the court a number of ""world-renowned"" experts agreed the child should not be given long-term life support as his ""quality of life"" is ""so poor"". Barrister Victoria Butler-Cole, who was appointed to represent the eight month old, said proposed treatment in the US was ""purely experimental"" and continuing his life support would only ""prolong the process of dying"".

"Chechen police 'kidnap and torture gay men' - LGBT activists Gay men are fleeing brutal persecution in Chechnya, where police are holding more than 100 people and torturing some of them in an anti-gay crackdown, Russian activists say. Natalia Poplevskaya of the Russian LGBT Network said ""we are working to evacuate people"".  A government spokesman called the reports ""lies"" and said homosexual people ""simply don't exist in the republic"". Homophobia is widespread in Chechnya. The mainly Muslim region is run by Ramzan Kadyrov, an authoritarian leader with a notorious private militia, fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ms Poplevskaya told the BBC that victims - either gay or just perceived as gay - are being held at a detention centre near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. She said the LGBT Network, based in St Petersburg, was aware of ""an organised campaign to detain gay men"" in Chechnya.  ""Torture is going on with electric shocks, beatings with cables. All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,"" she said. Three deaths have been reported. More than 30 people were crammed into one cell, she added. Despite appeals to the Russian authorities to stop the abuses, no action has been taken, she complained.  Kadyrov spokesman Alvi Karimov denied the alleged persecution. ""You can't detain and repress people who simply don't exist in the republic,"" he said.  The gay rights group has an email hotline to help victims, or potential victims, flee to other parts of Russia. Ms Poplevskaya declined to say where those victims were being sheltered. News of the crackdown was broken by the Russian daily Novaya Gazeta, which specialises in human rights investigations. It reported that the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. ""We confirm what was said in Novaya Gazeta,"" Ms Poplevskaya said, while declining to name her sources in Chechnya. Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors' Russia's mixed messages on LGBT Vigilantes claiming to be enforcing Muslim morals have long targeted gay people in Russia's North Caucasus.  But persecution of gay people in Chechnya intensified in late February, she said.  LGBT Network submitted reports about the crackdown to the Russian prosecutor-general's office, the Federal Investigative Committee (SK) and federal commissioner for human rights.  ""We got no response, despite all the appeals. The only thing was that the Russian ombudswoman said she would initiate an investigation. That was only after Amnesty International filed their own statement,"" she said.  ""The office of the military commandant is now the unofficial detention centre for torture, near Argun. All the victims confirmed that,"" she said.  But it is not a ""concentration camp"" for gays, she said, rejecting the description used in some media reports.  Foreign governments and human rights groups have voiced concern about the alleged abuses, urging the Russian and Chechen authorities to stop them.  The EU, the US state department, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are among those who have complained.

"Michigan student charged in 'peanut butter hazing' A US student has been charged with smearing peanut butter in the face of an undergraduate who has a potentially deadly allergy. Dale Merza, 20, is charged with misdemeanour hazing after the alleged attack last October on Andrew Seely, 19, at Central Michigan University. Mr Seely, who was sleeping at the time of the incident, sought medical treatment for serous facial swelling. The accused could get 93 days in jail and a $1,000 (£800) fine if convicted.   Mr Merza's legal representative told the Detroit Free Press his client, who was charged on Friday in Isabella County District Court, was innocent. ""This case has been blown way out of proportion by the individual's family members, who were not present and don't have any of the facts,"" lawyer Bruce Leach told the newspaper.  It is an induction ritual meted out typically to new members of the US college men and women's social clubs known as fraternities and sororities, but also to military recruits. The practice can include physical violence, sexual coercion, forced alcohol consumption, or degrading and dangerous ""pranks"" such as forcing people to eat vile food mixtures or consume large amounts of water. It is illegal in most US states, amounting usually to a misdemeanour charge, unless there are serious injuries. There has been a nationwide crackdown on hazing after high-profile deaths including that of Florida A&M University drumming student Robert Champion. Why is hazing so common? Mr Seely was targeted at an off-campus fraternity house, Alpha Chi Rho, which was sanctioned in 2011 for hazing incidents. His mother, Teresa Seely, wrote about the alleged hazing in a viral Facebook post in March, saying: ""He could have been killed."" The accounting student only told his family what had happened months afterwards. He blamed the incident for his decision to leave the college. The teenager's father, Paul Seely, told CBS News his son could have been killed if the peanut butter had entered his mouth. The Seely family said their son had made known to other members of the fraternity that he had a severe peanut allergy, for which he carries medication. The National Fraternity of Alphi Chi Rho condemned the incident, saying it did not condone such behaviour. ""Alpha Chi Rho is appalled and upset by the actions taken by individuals against Andrew Seely,"" said its statement.",Wednesday 12 April 2017,12-Apr-17,Student charged in 'peanut butter hazing',A 20-year-old is charged with misdemeanour hazing over the incident at Central Michigan University.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39569664
"Newlywed shoots 'wonderful' wife in San Bernardino class A newlywed who fatally shot his wife and a child before turning the gun on himself at a US school had projected a blissful marriage on social media.  Cedric Anderson entered a primary school on Monday in San Bernardino, California, and gunned down estranged spouse Karen Elaine Smith, 53. On Facebook, he referred to the special needs teacher as ""my wonderful little wife"", ""sexy"" and a ""pure spirit"". But some online posts by Anderson, also 53, hinted at a darker side.  The couple, who had reportedly been in a relationship for years, wed in January, but were separated within a few weeks. Anderson initially seemed to be a smitten husband, rhapsodising about his bride and proclaiming himself ""blessed"". ""She has no guile or pretense,"" he wrote in one post of Ms Smith. ""She has no ill will toward anyone. (It amazes me!).  ""I praise God for such a wonderful Lady!"" But in February Anderson exposed a violent streak as he boasted on Facebook of having ""almost personally attacked 3 Coaches to get my son Jared a scholarship"". ""A father is like a lion. He will kill you for his Blood!"" he wrote. On 12 March, he shared a New York Post video of a man kicking an elderly woman in the face on a bus, entitled: ""Can you hear me now?"" Anderson wrote along with the video: ""Deranged? Yea!"" Ms Smith's mother, Irma Sykes, told ABC News: ""We thought he was a fine person. Until they were married and then he showed the other side of him.  ""Which we had never seen before. We were shocked. He began to pick on my daughter and talk down to her.  ""And they had dated for four years. And after about three weeks, my husband and I decided, you need to get away from him.  ""He is not the kind of person you thought he was."" In 2013 Anderson was charged with assault and battery, brandishing a weapon and disturbing the peace, but the charges were dismissed a year later. In 1993, he was charged with two misdemeanour counts of battery in Kern Superior Court, the Los Angeles Times reported.  However, court records show both charges were dismissed six months later.  Somehow, the man who posted a selfie on Facebook a month ago celebrating ""date night!!!"" with his new wife was able to walk into the classroom on Monday morning where she was teaching and gun her down in cold blood with a Smith and Wesson .357 revolver. Without saying a word, he discharged 10 shots and stopped to reload, police said.

"Trump says Nato 'no longer obsolete' US President Donald Trump has said Nato is ""no longer obsolete"", reversing a stance that had alarmed allies. Hosting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House, Mr Trump said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. He called on Nato to do more to help Iraqi and Afghan ""partners"".  Mr Trump has repeatedly questioned Nato's purpose, while complaining that the US pays an unfair share of membership.  The Nato U-turn wasn't Mr Trump's only change of heart on Wednesday. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said he would not label China a currency manipulator, despite having repeatedly pledged to do so on his first day in office. At a joint press conference with Mr Stoltenberg, Mr Trump said: ""The secretary general and I had a productive discussion about what more Nato can do in the fight against terrorism. ""I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism. ""I said it [Nato] was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete."" But Mr Trump reiterated his call for Nato member states to contribute more funding to the alliance. ""If other countries pay their fair share instead of relying on the United States to make up the difference we will all be much more secure,"" said the US president. Mr Stoltenberg thanked Mr Trump for ""an excellent and very productive meeting"". Earlier this week Nato welcomed Montenegro as its 29th member nation. The meeting at the White House comes hours after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a trip to Moscow. ""Things went pretty well. Maybe better than anticipated,"" Mr Trump said about that meeting. ""Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all.

"Borussia Dortmund: Thomas Tuchel says club 'ignored' over Monaco tie   Borussia Dortmund felt ""completely ignored"" over the rescheduling of their Champions League game against Monaco, says manager Thomas Tuchel. Dortmund lost 3-2 in the first leg of the quarter-final on Wednesday, less than 24 hours after an attack on their bus caused the match to be postponed. ""We were told by text message that Uefa was making this decision,"" said Tuchel. ""A decision made in Switzerland that concerns us directly. We will not forget it, it is a very bad feeling."" Following Tuchel's comments, Uefa released a statement saying the decision to play the match at 17:45 BST on Wednesday was made in ""complete agreement with clubs and authorities"". European football's governing body added: ""We were in touch with all parties today and never received any information which suggested that any of the teams did not want to play."" Three explosions hit Dortmund's team bus as they travelled to their Westfalenstadion home on Tuesday, with the match rescheduled later that evening. ""Of course we have to keep it going, but we still want to be competitive,"" added Tuchel. ""We do not want to use the situation as an excuse. ""We wished we would have had more time to deal with what happened, but someone in Switzerland decided we must play."" Spain defender Marc Bartra suffered a broken wrist and has subsequently had surgery, but no other players were hurt. ""Every player has the right to deal with it in his way. The team did not feel in the mood, in which you must be for such a game,"" said Tuchel. ""We let the players choose if they wanted to play. But this morning, we found that the training had done good, that it had made us think of something else."" German police have described it as a targeted attack and detained a suspect with ""Islamist"" links. ""We were attacked as men and we tried to solve the problem on the ground,"" said Tuchel, who has been in charge of the Bundesliga side since 2015. ""Everyone has their own way of reacting to events. The players had the choice not to play, but no-one chose this option.""

                         Dortmund were 2-0 and 3-1 down to French side Monaco, for whom 18-year-old forward Kylian Mbappe scored twice. ""The team has shown an incredible character,"" added Tuchel. ""We have won the second half, the spirit in the second half was great."" Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim had some sympathy with Tuchel's view, but said the packed fixture calendar contributed to the hasty rescheduling.

"Melania Trump wins damages from Daily Mail over 'escort' allegation The UK's Daily Mail newspaper has agreed to pay damages and costs to the first lady of the United States over an article about her modelling career. The newspaper had reported allegations that Melania Trump once worked as an escort, but later retracted the claims. The story was published during the US election campaign last year. Mrs Trump accepted damages and an apology from the newspaper at London's High Court. The article was published by the Daily Mail newspaper, and subsequently the paper's digital operation Mail Online. In a statement, Mrs Trump's lawyer said that she is ""very pleased"" and ""will remain vigilant to protect her good name and reputation from those who make false and defamatory statements about her"". Mrs Trump filed a lawsuit against the Daily Mail in the UK, and filed against Mail Online in the US. The payout settles the case both in New York and the UK, despite London's High Court having no jurisdiction in the US. The US suit, filed last year, sought damages of $150m (£120m). The amount accepted by Mrs Trump in London was not disclosed in court. However, reports suggest the payout was closer to $3m, including legal costs and damages. In its apology, the Daily Mail acknowledged it had published ""allegations that she provided services beyond simply modelling"". The article also claimed that Mr and Mrs Trump may have met three years before they actually did, and later ""staged"" their first meeting. ""We accept that these allegations about Mrs Trump are not true,"" the newspaper said. A lawyer for Mrs Trump told the London court the allegations ""strike at the heart of the claimant's personal integrity and dignity"". Her lawyer said the double-page spread in August last year, titled ""Racy photos and troubling questions about his wife's past that could derail Trump"", featured an old nude photo of Mrs Trump from her modelling career. ""Readers of the newspaper that day could not fail to miss the article,"" he said. And so the mighty Mail titles have been Trumped. Well, almost. There are people in the legal profession flabbergasted at the size of the damages that Melania Trump has received from Associated Newspapers. But given some of the figures bandied about when this case first arose, that isn't as bad as some at the Mail group may have feared.  Moreover, the Mail are pointing out that they stick by some aspects of their original story, but accept error on the most salacious: that the First Lady was an escort. It will be interesting to see if this settlement encourages others to be more aggressive toward UK papers, and also whether it helps to spread the trend for legal action across multiple jurisdictions.  Charles Harder, Mrs Trump's lawyer, also acted for Hulk Hogan when the wrestler brought his $140m (£112m) case against Gawker Media, forcing its sale.  Compared to that, this action is small fry. Mrs Trump's lawsuit initially said that Mrs Trump had the ""unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity... to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which [she] is one of the most photographed women in the world"". Critics used the phrasing to question whether Mrs Trump had plans to make financial gains from her position as first lady.  A second version of the suit, re-filed weeks later, dropped the controversial wording. Mrs Trump was born Melanija Knavs, in Sevnica, a small town about an hour's drive from Slovenia's capital of Ljubljana. She was signed to a modelling agency in her late teens, and began flying around Europe and the US, appearing in high-profile ad campaigns.  She met Donald Trump in 1998, when she was 28 years old, at a party during New York Fashion week.  They married seven years later.

"Illinois woman plotted Valentine's Day Canada mall massacre A US woman has admitted plotting to carry out a mass shooting in a Canadian shopping centre on Valentine's Day. Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, 25, made the surprise plea to conspiracy to commit murder, during a routine court hearing. She was charged alongside Canadian Randall Steven Shepherd for planning a massacre at the mall in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2015.  They wanted to use rifles and gas bombs to kill shoppers at a food court. Shepherd pleaded guilty in November and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Chris Hansen, a spokeswoman with the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service, said the American's plea on Tuesday in Nova Scotia's Supreme Court ""was unexpected"".  Souvannarath, of Geneva, Illinois, was scheduled to go on trial in May.  According to an Agreed Statement of Facts filed in the province's top court, 21-year-old Shepherd, Souvannarath, and a third person, 19-year-old James Gamble, plotted online to commit mass murder on 14 February 2015 in Halifax.  In December 2014, Gamble began an online relationship with Souvannarath, who ""had a pre-existing interest in school shootings and Nazism"". They bonded over a shared obsession with the 1999 Columbine High School attack in Colorado and other mass shootings.  Gamble eventually confessed his desire to commit mass murder, and the two began plotting the shooting spree throughout January and early February of 2015, targeting the Halifax Shopping Centre.  They even gave their plot a codename, Der Untergang, which means ""the downfall"" in German.   Gamble kept a hesitant Shepherd abreast of the plot, according to the court filing.  Police discovered the plans following a tip-off from Crime Stoppers just a day before the shooting spree was due to take place, as Shepherd was collecting Souvannarath from Halifax airport.  Gamble committed suicide as police closed in.  Souvannarath's sentencing is scheduled for early October. The Crown has yet to make sentencing recommendations.

"Malala is 'humbled' by honorary Canadian citizenship Nobel Peace prize laureate Malala Yousafzai says she is ""humbled"" to become the sixth person to receive an honorary Canadian citizenship.  At 19, she is also the youngest ever person to receive the honour.  During the official ceremonies in Ottawa, she called on Canadian politicians to use their influence to help fund education for girls worldwide, including refugees.  Ms Yousafzai is a global advocate for women's rights and education.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau praised Ms Yousafzai for her advocacy, calling her ""the newest and possibly bravest citizen of Canada"".  The Pakistani schoolgirl activist was originally meant to receive her citizenship in October 2014, an honour bestowed on her under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper's government.  That event was cancelled when it coincided with the shooting death of a ceremonial guard Nathan Cirillo and an attack on Parliament by gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.  Soldier killed in Canada shootings Malala spoke of the attack in her address said in an address to legislators in the Canadian Parliament on Wednesday. Many in the audience were in Ottawa that day.  ""The man who attacked Parliament Hill called himself a Muslim,"" she said. ""But he did not share my faith.""  She said he instead shared the same hatred as the man who allegedly shot six people at a Quebec City mosque in January, the attacker who killed six people in London in March, and the Taliban gunmen who in 2012 shot her for defying their ban on girls attending school in her native Pakistan.  ""These men have tried to divide us and destroy our democracies, our freedom of religion, our right to go to school. But we - and you - refuse to be divided,"" she said.  She also praised Canada's embrace of refugees and its ongoing international development work for women and girls.  Only five other people have received honorary Canadian citizenship: Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, religious leader Aga Khan, Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Malala was accompanied on Wednesday by her parents Ziauddin and Toor Pekai Yousafzai.  Earlier in the day, Malala surprised Ottawa high school students by arriving unannounced to take their questions during an event with by Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, Mr Trudeau's wife.  Ms Yousafzai will also meet Conservative interim opposition leader Rona Ambrose, who called her a ""symbol of determination and hope for young girls around the world"".  In 2009, when she was just 11 years-old, Malala began writing a blog for the BBC Urdu service under a pseudonym, describing her life under the Taliban.

Steam train hits 100mph landmark on line A steam train has reached 100mph on Britain's mainline rail network for the first time in 50 years. The Peppercorn class A1 steam locomotive Tornado clocked the speed during a test run on the East Coast Main Line between Doncaster and Newcastle early on Wednesday morning. The trip was part of a bid to raise Tornado's speed limit for passenger trips from 75mph to 90mph by the end of the year. Tornado was the first steam locomotive to be built in the UK for almost half a century when it was completed in Darlington in 2008. Thousands of people turned out to watch the locomotive when it operated regular services on the Settle to Carlisle line for three days in February.,Thursday 13 April 2017,13-Apr-17,Steam train hits 100mph landmark,The Peppercorn class A1 steam locomotive roared along the East Coast Main Line overnight.,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-39581712
"Manchester by the Sea plotline 'inspired couple to kill son' Spoiler alert: This story contains details of a plot twist in the movie Manchester by the Sea. A US couple are accused of murdering their adopted disabled son and razing the house to cover up the crime after watching Manchester by the Sea. Jeffrey Franklin, 16, was murdered by his parents on 28 February in upstate New York, right after his mother saw the film, a court heard. The Oscar-winning Casey Affleck picture is about a man who accidentally kills his children in a house fire. Heather and Ernest Franklin each face charges of murder and arson. ""Within two hours of that movie playing to this defendant,"" said Chenango County District Attorney Joseph McBride, ""Jeffrey's deceased."" The prosecutor told a judge that Affleck's character is spared prosecution in the movie after being told a person cannot be charged for an accidental crime. Only days after the film won two Academy Awards, a fire was reported at the Franklins' home in Guilford - about 180 miles (290km) north of New York City. ""The victim was badly burned,"" Mr McBride said, according to a transcript of proceedings as the couple appeared in Chenango County Court on Friday.  ""Because of the damage to the body by the fire, the pathologist is not able to determine the cause of death,"" he added However, the boy did not have smoke or soot in his mouth or airway, which would have indicated he had been alive when the fire broke out, said officials. According to the prosecutor, the boy had special needs and suffered from chronic incontinence. Mrs Franklin, 33, had complained on Facebook about the toll taken by caring for Jeffrey, whom the couple adopted in around 2012. ""There was a very big strain in the family relationship because of Jeffrey's special needs and that this defendant was complaining on Facebook about the strain that that was putting on her,"" said Mr McBride. Mrs Franklin - who is currently pregnant - told investigators that she had visited two shops looking for medication that night. But the prosecution says evidence shows she did not go to the store aisles where the drug was stocked. Mr Franklin, 35, said he had been outside chasing his dogs when the fire occurred. But while Affleck won a Best Actor Oscar for his role as a grief-stricken father in the movie, investigators did not find Mr Franklin so convincing. Mr McBride said police found the husband to be ""very calm, cool, collected"" as they arrived at the home. He allegedly ""pointed to the room where Jeffrey was lying and the defendant had no physical injuries from any attempt to try to save him"". Mrs Franklin's lawyer told the court she was innocent until proven guilty. He added the state was ""charging her with murder without even knowing what caused the death"". If convicted, the couple faces up to 25 years in prison.  Nearly $11,000 (£8,700) raised by a GoFundMe campaign was returned to donors after criminal charges were filed, according to WBNG News.

"Mammoth tusk haul seized by Chinese customs Chinese customs officers have seized more than a tonne of tusks from animals that have been extinct for thousands of years - mammoths. State media are reporting that the massive haul came from Russia and was seized in north-east China in February. The largest piece of mammoth ivory seized was more than 1.6m (5ft) long, a customs officer was quoted as saying. There is no international ban on the trade but Chinese officials said the haul was not declared. The stockpile is part of a booming trade between Russia and China in ivory taken from the skeletons of mammoths found in the Siberian tundra. The effects of global warming in the Arctic has made it easier to collect tusks preserved in ice for thousands of years, researchers say. More than 100 woolly mammoth tusks were seized at the port of Luobei in Heilongjiang province, in addition to 37 woolly rhino horn parts and more than a tonne of jade. They were hidden in concealed compartments in a truck, according to reports. The truck driver is alleged to have claimed he was only carrying soybeans, and to have fled the scene when the truck was inspected. He and another person were later arrested. Listen: The growing and legal trade in mammoth ivory (BBC Radio 4) DNA clues to why woolly mammoth died out There are estimated to be around 10 million mammoths that ""remain incarcerated within the permafrost of the Arctic tundra"", according to Douglas MacMillan, a professor of conservation and applied resource economics at the University of Kent. Some mammoth experts have suggested that the trade in mammoth ivory should be banned, even though the animals are extinct. They argue that their tusks are often sold as elephant tusks, and thus encourage overall demand for ivory. It is estimated that more than 50% of the ivory sold into China, which has has the biggest ivory market in the world, is mammoth ivory. Hong Kong is a major destination, and the ivory is used to make jewellery and other objects, including ornamental tusks. But other experts like Prof MacMillan say that a ban would not halt the trade but rather ""drive it underground and attract the attention of organised crime groups"". Most of the world's woolly mammoths had died out by about 10,500 years ago. Scientists believe that human hunting and environmental changes played a role in their extinction. China has announced a ban on all elephant ivory trade and processing activities by the end of 2017.",Thursday 13 April 2017,13-Apr-17,Haul of mammoth tusks 'hidden in truck',"There is no international ban on the trade in the mammoth ivory, most of which is found in Siberia.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-39583877

"Syria war: US says 'low point' of Russia ties cannot continue US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says ties with Russia are at a low point and must improve. After two hours of talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, he said that the ""two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this relationship"". Although there was some ""common ground"" on Syria, ""broad differences"" remained. Mr Lavrov said the two sides needed to overcome ""time-bomb issues"" inherited from Barack Obama's administration. Tensions have risen since a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last week that left 89 people dead.  The US and its allies blamed the Syrian government, and the US fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase in response. Syria denied carrying out the chemical attack and has the support of its main ally, Russia, which on Wednesday vetoed a motion brought to the UN Security Council which would have required Bashar al-Assad's government to co-operate with investigators.  It is the eighth time Moscow has used its veto to protect Syria. Both Mr Tillerson and Mr Lavrov said the discussions were frank. Mr Tillerson said: ""I expressed the view that the current state of US-Russia relations is at a low point. There is a low level of trust between our two countries."" He added: ""We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of greatest importance to both of us."" It was a view echoed by President Donald Trump later, who said at a press briefing with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: ""We may be at an all-time low in terms of our relationship with Russia."" Mr Trump said ""it would be a fantastic thing"" if the nations improved ties, but warned ""it may be just the opposite"". Mr Lavrov said a pragmatic conversation was needed to remove the ""irritants that piled up under the Obama administration"". Both ministers said there was agreement on working towards a stable and unified Syria, and in defeating so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Both agreed to work towards an international investigation of the chemical attack. But it was obvious there were many differences. Mr Tillerson said there was clear evidence that the recent chemical attack ""was planned, directed and executed by Syrian regime forces"". He said the reign of Bashar al-Assad must end and that Mr Trump's description of the Syrian president as ""an animal"" was ""a characterisation President Assad has brought on himself"". Mr Lavrov said there was no evidence Syria was behind the chemical attack and pointed to the turmoil that had been brought to other nations when leaders had been removed. There was little concrete to come from the meeting, although the fact Mr Putin granted Mr Tillerson an audience - which had been in doubt - was a measure of success. Mr Putin did say he was ready to restore the US-Russia air safety agreement over Syria, and Mr Tillerson said there would be working groups set up on smaller issues. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Lavrov said Russia had ""a lot of questions regarding very ambiguous and contradictory ideas... coming from Washington"".  Afterwards he said ""we understand each other better"" and there were ""many prospects for co-operation with the US"". He said there were ""certain time-bomb issues inherited from the previous administration - we know to overcome these obstacles we have to make efforts and that the Americans must move towards us as well"". Earlier, the US and Russian presidents revealed the wide gulf between them over Syria. Referring to Mr Assad in a Fox Business Network interview, Mr Trump said: ""Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person... if Russia didn't go in and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now."" He later called Mr Assad a ""butcher"". Speaking on Mir television, Mr Putin rejected allegations that Syria was behind the chemical attack, saying Syria had given up its chemical stockpile. He said: ""Where is the proof that Syrian troops used chemical weapons? There isn't any."" Referring to the US air strike, he said: ""But there was a violation of international law. That is an obvious fact.""

"Bangladesh executes Islamist for 2004 British envoy attack Bangladesh has hanged an Islamist militant more than a decade after he injured a top British envoy in a grenade attack. Mufti Abdul Hannan, the leader of Harkatul Jihad Al Islami (HuJI), was hanged at the same time as two associates on Wednesday. All had been found guilty of the 2004 attack at a 14th-Century Sufi shrine in Sylhet, in which three people died. The British high commissioner, Anwar Choudhury, sustained leg injuries. Mr Choudhury, who was born in Sylhet, was just 18 days into the job when he was caught up in the attempt on his life.  At the time, Mr Choudhury, who is now ambassador to Peru, told AFP news agency: ""The bomb hit my stomach after it was hurled, but did not explode [then]. ""It fell on the ground near the foot of the district chief and then exploded with a big bang."" Hannan had fought in Afghanistan against the Soviets before joining HuJI, which has been accused of being behind several attacks. Prosecutors said he had headed the organisation since the late 1990s, but - speaking on Wednesday - his wife said he was innocent of all charges. Last month, militants threw bombs at a prison van carrying him, reportedly in an attempt to free him.

"Tesla board 'too close to Elon Musk' A group of Tesla shareholders has questioned the independence of the electric carmaker's board, warning it is too close to boss and co-founder Elon Musk. In a letter, they said the board was ""largely unchanged"" since the firm went public and at risk of ""groupthink"". They urged it to re-elect members annually and to add two new independent directors to the board. In a tweet Mr Musk said the investors ""should buy Ford stock"" instead.  The shareholders include the California State Teachers Retirement System, Hermes Equity Ownership Services and CtW Investment Group, among others, and collectively manage assets worth $721bn (£547.5bn). In a letter to Tesla lead independent director Antonio Gracias, they called for action before the firm launched its Model 3 sedan later this year - its first vehicle aimed at the mass market. ""While meeting the technical definition of independence, five of the six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgment,"" the letter said. ""A thoroughly independent board would provide a critical check on possible dysfunctional group dynamics, such as groupthink."" With an almost Trumpian flair, Elon Musk has regularly used Twitter to sound off about his frustrations with Tesla's investors. With stock surging, he gloated that there was ""stormy weather in ShortsVille"" - a dig at those who shorted - sold - their Tesla stock believing its value was about to fall. On Wednesday, Mr Musk tweeted that the investment group should buy into Ford if they wanted a different corporate culture, a comment that has more weight now that Tesla is, according to market cap, worth more money. I don't see this demand gaining much traction. The concerned group thinks there are too many personal ties between board members at Tesla, potentially clouding judgement. But there are other investors who support Tesla precisely for that reason: it's Mr Musk's team, vision and ambition. And so far he's doing very well. Tesla board members include Mr Gracias, a shareholder and board member of SpaceX, another company controlled by Elon Musk; as well as Brad Buss, a former chief financial officer at solar power business SolarCity, which was founded by Mr Musk and later bought by Tesla. The $2bn deal was widely criticised on Wall Street and led to a 13% fall in Tesla's share price when it was announced last June. A Tesla spokesman said it regularly engaged with shareholders and valued their feedback.  ""We are actively engaged in a search process for independent board members, which is something we committed to do several months ago, and expect to announce new additions fairly soon."" However, Mr Musk tweeted: ""This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing..."" This month Tesla became most valuable US car company, beating General Motors for the top spot. Last year it sold 76,230 vehicles, missing its target of at least 80,000 cars sold.

"US military drops 'mother of all bombs on IS' in Afghanistan The US military says it has dropped a 21,600lb (9,800kg) bomb on a tunnel complex used by Islamic State militants in Afghanistan. The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB), known as ""the mother of all bombs"", is the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in a conflict. The Pentagon said it was dropped from a US aircraft in Nangarhar province. The news came hours after the Pentagon admitted an air strike in Syria mistakenly killed 18 rebels. It said a partnered force had mistakenly identified the target location as an IS position, but the strike on 11 April had killed rebels from the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is backed by Washington. How powerful is 'mother of all bombs'? The strike in Afghanistan follows last week's death of a US special forces soldier fighting IS in Nangarhar. The GBU-43/B bomb was dropped in Achin district on Thursday evening local time, the Pentagon said. It is more than 9m (30 feet) in length. It was first tested in 2003, but had not been deployed in combat before. ""We targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely, making it easier for them to target US military advisers and Afghan forces in the area,"" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, using another name for IS. He said necessary precautions were taken to prevent civilian casualties and ""collateral damage"". Achin district governor Esmail Shinwari told the BBC there were no civilian casualties because no civilians lived in the area. Earlier Mr Shinwari told the AFP news agency that the explosion was the biggest he had ever seen and that huge flames ""engulfed the area"". The US has not yet confirmed the results of the strike in detail, but a local official told the BBC that many IS militants were killed, allegedly including the brother of a senior leader. US President Donald Trump called it ""another successful job"". The clue is in the ungainly name - the MOAB or GBU-43/B massive ordnance air blast is the US military's most destructive conventional (that is non-nuclear) bomb.  It is a huge weapon and is GPS-guided. It was dropped from a MC-130 aircraft - the US Special Forces variant of the Hercules transport. The weapon is carried on a special cradle inside the aircraft from which it is extracted by a parachute. Its principal effect is a massive blast over a huge area. It is a larger version of weapons used during the Vietnam War.  The Trump administration's policy towards Afghanistan remains under consideration but the use of this weapon sends a powerful signal that IS is top of the administration's target list wherever its offshoots may be found. Gen John Nicholson, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, said the jihadist group's ""losses have mounted, they are using IEDs, bunkers and tunnels to thicken their defence.  ""This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive."" Mr Shinwari said clearance operations by Afghan special forces with US air support had begun in the area nearly two weeks ago. Many IS militants had been killed or injured, he added. IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015. It was the first time that IS had officially spread outside the Arab world. It was the first major militant group to directly challenge the Afghan Taliban's dominance over the local insurgency.  IS in Afghanistan: How successful has the group been? However, experts say it has struggled to build a wide political base and the indigenous support it expected in Afghanistan.  It has also steadily lost territory and fighters to US air strikes and an assault by Afghan forces on the ground Estimates about IS's numerical strength inside Afghanistan vary, ranging from several hundred to a few thousand fighters. US forces say their number has been cut in half since early 2016 due to military operations.",Friday 14 April 2017,14-Apr-17,US drops 'mother of all bombs on IS',"The GBU-43/B bomb was used for the first time in combat to target an IS tunnel complex, the US says.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39595989
"Eurovision: Russia will not broadcast contest after Ukraine ban Russian broadcaster Channel One will not broadcast the Eurovision Song Contest next month because the country's singer has been barred from host country Ukraine. Russia's decision removes any chance of it competing this year, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said. Ukraine is refusing to allow Julia Samoilova to perform at Eurovision because she has visited Crimea, the peninsula seized by Russia in 2014. The EBU has condemned the ban. It says Ukraine is undermining the non-political nature of the contest. The union, which produces Eurovision, said it had offered two possible solutions to Channel One. The proposals were for Ms Samoilova to perform via satellite from Russia or for another contestant to be allowed to travel to Ukraine to take her place. Both were rejected and the broadcaster has now announced it will not televise the event. ""Unfortunately this means Russia will no longer be able to take part in this year's competition,"" the EBU said. ""We very much wanted all 43 countries to be able to participate and did all we could to achieve this."" The Eurovision tension explained X Factor singer to represent UK Ukraine banned the Russian performer under a law which excludes anyone who entered Crimea via Russia. Frank Dieter Freiling, chairman of the event's steering committee, said the ban ""thoroughly undermines the integrity and non-political nature"" of the contest and its mission to unite nations in friendly competition. But he added: ""Our top priority remains to produce a spectacular Eurovision Song Contest in May."" Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads since the annexation of Crimea and the subsequent separatist conflict in east Ukraine which Moscow is accused of stoking. Ukraine is hosting Eurovision because its singer, Jamala, won in Sweden last year. She took the crown with 1944, a song about Josef Stalin's mass deportation of Crimean Tatars during World War Two. The alleged political overtones of the song annoyed many Russians. Moscow is especially irked by the ban on Samoilova, 28, as she uses a wheelchair and the slogan of this year's Eurovision is ""Celebrate diversity"".",Friday 14 April 2017,14-Apr-17,Russia will not broadcast Eurovision,"Its competitor has been barred by host Ukraine, and now Russia will have no chance of taking part.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39596927
"United Airlines passenger ordeal 'worse than fall of Saigon' A man dragged screaming off a United Airlines flight described his ordeal as ""more horrifying"" than his experiences in the Vietnam War, his lawyer says. Attorneys for Dr David Dao, who lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose and ""significant"" concussion in the incident, say they will sue. His daughter, Crystal Dao Pepper, told the news conference in Chicago the family was ""sickened"" by what happened. Video of the incident has been watched by millions of people online. Law enforcement officials dragged Dr Dao off Sunday evening's Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, flight because it was fully booked, and the airline wanted four passengers to make way for staff members. The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician had refused to leave, saying he needed to go home to see his patients. Lawyer Thomas Demetrio told journalists on Thursday: ""He [Dr Dao] said that he left Vietnam in 1975 when Saigon fell and he was on a boat and he said he was terrified.  ""He said that being dragged down the aisle was more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam."" Ms Dao Pepper, who lives in suburban Chicago, said: ""What happened to my dad should have never happened to any human being, regardless of the circumstance. ""We were horrified and shocked and sickened to learn what happened to him and to see what happened to him."" Dr Dao's lawyers have filed an emergency court request for the airline to preserve evidence ahead of a hearing next Monday morning. The filing with an Illinois state court demands that United Airlines and the city of Chicago preserve all surveillance videos, cockpit voice recordings, passenger and crew lists related to the flight. United Airlines said it would refund the ticket costs of all passengers on Sunday's flight. Dr Dao was released on Wednesday night from a Chicago hospital, his lawyer said, adding that he planned to have reconstructive surgery. Mr Demetrio, and a second lawyer for Mr Dao, said that neither they nor the Dao family had heard from United Airlines yet. ""For a long time airlines, United in particular, have bullied us,"" Mr Demetrio told the press conference.  ""We want respect and we want dignity, that's it! Not a big deal."" The lawyer said he did not believe Mr Dao's race played a factor, despite an email he had received suggesting he was ""the modern day, Asian Rosa Parks"", a reference to the civil rights activist who refused to give up her seat on an Alabama bus in 1955. Mr Demetrio also said the family had not heard from United yet. But the airline said in a statement that its chief executive, Oscar Munoz, and the company had ""called Dr Dao on numerous occasions to express our heartfelt and deepest apologies"". The company did not comment on the potential litigation. On Wednesday, United's CEO said he felt ""shame and embarrassment"" and vowed it would never happen again.  More than 150,000 people have signed online petitions calling for Mr Munoz to resign, but he has refused to do so. The CEO said Dr Dao had not been at fault, adding ""no one should be treated that way. Period."" However, Mr Munoz initially described Dr Dao as ""disruptive and belligerent"". The airline has confirmed it is offering compensation to customers on United Flight 3411 for their flights. Three aviation security officers involved in removing Dr Dao from the plane have been ""placed on leave"", says the Chicago Department of Aviation.

"Trump reverses course in 24 hours from Nato to China to Fed US President Donald Trump has reversed course in the space of 24 hours on an array of populist positions he adopted during the election campaign. He declared Nato was ""no longer obsolete"" and dropped his pledge to declare China a currency manipulator. Mr Trump also said he was no longer opposed to a federal exports agency he once dismissed as ""unnecessary"". And the president signalled he was open to reappointing Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, his administration dropped a freeze on federal hiring that it imposed in January. The about-faces suggest the mercurial Mr Trump may be favouring a more pragmatic, moderate approach to the hardline economic nationalism that helped elect him. The startling series of flip-flops come amid reports of a titanic White House power struggle between chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Jared Kushner. According to the Washington rumour mill, Mr Bannon - the former Breitbart News executive - has been sidelined after falling out with the president's son-in-law, Mr Kushner. Mr Trump's decision not to label China a ""currency manipulator"" emerged in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. That U-turn follows his talks last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a ""currency manipulator"" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of ""raping"" the US. But experts said a formal declaration to that effect by the Treasury Department could have led to US sanctions, which would have prompted retaliation from Beijing. Mr Trump's last campaign ad depicted Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, as a member of a shadowy globalist cabal ""who control the levers of power in Washington"". On Wednesday, he told the Wall Street Journal he ""respects"" the US central bank chief. He also indicated he might consider reappointing her next year, saying she would not be ""toast"". Mr Trump was once highly critical of the Fed, saying its low interest rate policy had hurt savers. Now he says he likes ""a low-interest rate policy"". On his first working day in office, Mr Trump signed a presidential memorandum to suspend hiring of non-military federal workers, in a move that delighted small government conservatives. The order mandated that ""no vacant positions… may be filled and no new positions may be created"". But that policy was gone on Wednesday. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said: ""It does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly.""  He said they were ""replacing it with a smarter plan, a more strategic plan, a more surgical plan"". In the Wall Street Journal interview, the president praised the Export-Import Bank, which he dismissed in August last year as an ""unnecessary"" agency with ""a lot of excess baggage"". The bank, which provides taxpayer-backed loans for the purchase of US exports, is accused by conservatives of corporate cronyism and welfare. Now he plans to fill two vacancies on its board. ""It turns out that, first of all,"" Mr Trump told the Journal, ""lots of small companies are really helped.""  Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose during the campaign. But as he hosted Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House on Wednesday, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. ""I said it [Nato] was obsolete,"" Mr Trump said. ""It's no longer obsolete."" CNN political pundit David Gregory says the shifts show Trump is willing to be a dealmaking president. ""He's flexible, perhaps unprincipled, with a pragmatic approach to government,"" he said. But he warned that, although tacking back and forth is fine, it is dangerous to be ""all over the map"" because people stop believing what you say.

"Saturn moon 'able to support life' Saturn's ice-crusted moon Enceladus may now be the single best place to go to look for life beyond Earth.  The assessment comes on the heels of new observations at the 500km-wide world made by the Cassini probe.  It has flown through and sampled the waters from a subsurface ocean that are being jetted into space.  Cassini’s chemistry analysis strongly suggests the Enceladean seafloor has hot fluid vents - places that on Earth are known to teem with life.  To be clear: the existence of such hydrothermal systems is not a guarantee that organisms are present on the little moon; its environment may still be sterile. But the new results make a compelling case to return to this world with more sophisticated instrumentation - technologies that can re-sample the ejected water for clear evidence that biology is also at play.  ""We're pretty darn sure that the internal ocean of Enceladus is habitable and we need to go back and investigate it further,"" said Cassini scientist Dr Hunter Waite from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. ""If there is no life there, why not? And if there is, all the better. But you certainly want to ask the question because it's almost as equally as interesting if there is no life there, given the conditions,"" he told BBC News.  The sub-surface ocean on Enceladus is thought to be many kilometres deep, kept liquid by the heat generated from the constant gravitational squeezing the moon receives from the mighty Saturn. Cassini has already established that this voluminous liquid is in contact with the rock bed from the types of salts and silica that have also been detected in the jets.  But what scientists really wanted to know is if a particular interactive process seen at Earth was taking place in the distant abyss - something called serpentinisation.  At the mid-ocean ridges on our planet, seawater is drawn through, and reacts with, hot upwelling rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium. As the minerals in these rocks incorporate H2O molecules into their crystal structure, they release hydrogen - a byproduct that can be used by some microbes as an energy source to drive their metabolism.  It is the definitive signal for molecular hydrogen in the plumes of Enceladus that Cassini has now confirmed.  ""If you were a micro-organism, hydrogen would be like candy - it's your favourite food,"" explained Dr Chris McKay, an astrobiologist with the US space agency (Nasa).  ""It's very good energetically; it can support micro-organisms in grand style. Finding hydrogen is certainly a big plus; icing on the cake for the habitability argument, and a very tasty one at that.""  The type of microbes described by Dr McKay are called methanogens because they make methane as they react the hydrogen with carbon dioxide.   Nasa, which leads the Cassini mission, was due to make the hydrogen announcement a couple of months after the probe's last fly-through of the moon's jets in October 2015. But the agency held off.  One of the concerns was that the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer on the satellite can actually make molecular hydrogen inside itself if water enters the instrument in a particular way.  Dr Waite's group has spent a year analysing the data to make sure the hydrogen signal is intrinsic to the jets and not merely some artefact of the INMS's operation. And although serpentinisation is arguably the best explanation for the signal, it is possible to produce the gas also from the heating of very primitive (meteoritic) rock.  The Cassini mission is coming to a close. Having spent 12 years circling Saturn, it is now running low on fuel and will be dumped in the atmosphere of the ringed planet in September - to ensure it cannot collide with Enceladus at some future date and contaminate it.  As brilliant as the probe's instruments are, they were never designed to make a direct life detection at the bright white moon. This would need a whole new class of spectrometers. A proposal is being put together to fly them in 2026.  Nasa has already green-lit a mission to Europa, an ocean moon of Jupiter. It very likely has serpentinisation going on as well. But its ice shell is very much thicker and it could be that very little of the water escapes to space. The appeal of Enceladus is the ease with which its subsurface can be studied because of the material carried into space by its network of geysers. A probe only needs fly through the emission to make the investigation.   ""The Cassini mission has really brought Enceladus to the fore in terms of the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System,"" commented British Cassini scientist Dr Andrew Coates.  “The top three now I would say are about equal. There's Mars, which may have had life 3.8 billion years ago when conditions were very different to what they are now. There's Europa, which has a subsurface ocean; and now Enceladus. Those three may have, or had, the right conditions for life."" Dr Waite added: “For life, you need liquid water, organics, and the CHNOPS elements (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur). OK, we haven't yet measured phosphorus and sulphur at Enceladus. But you also need some kind of metabolic energy source, and the new Cassini results are an important contribution in that regard.""

"CIA chief Pompeo: Wikileaks 'hostile intelligence service' The head of the CIA Mike Pompeo has described anti-secrecy organisation WikiLeaks as a ""non-state hostile intelligence service"" that is often abetted by states such as Russia. Russian military intelligence used Wikileaks to distribute hacked material during the US election, he added. Earlier this month Wikileaks published details of what it said were CIA hacking tools. The FBI and CIA have launched a criminal investigation into the leak. ""WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,"" Mr Pompeo said, speaking at a Washington think tank. ""It overwhelmingly focuses on the US, while seeking support from anti-democratic countries and organisations,"" he added. Wikileaks responded by posting a screenshot of a tweet sent by Mr Pompeo last July, in which the then member of the House of Representatives referred to material contained in the Wikileaks release of Democratic party emails. The tweet has since been deleted. US intelligence agencies say Russia stole emails from the Democratic party to try to tilt the election in favour of Republican Donald Trump. However Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has said the release was not intended to affect the election. The CIA has refused to comment  on the Wikileaks release of papers said to detail a wide range of hacking methods including using mobile phones and smart TVs. But former CIA boss Michael Hayden told the BBC the leak was ""incredibly damaging"" and had made the US ""less safe"". US officials say IT contractors are likely to have breached security and handed the documents to Wikileaks. Mr Assange has said Wikileaks will give technology firms access to the full details of the alleged spying programmes so they can defend their products against the hacking. The Wikileaks founder has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012 after seeking refuge there when he lost his appeal against extradition to the Sweden, where he faces rape allegations. He says the sex was consensual and believes the allegations are politically motivated with the aim of having him extradited to the US to face charges over Wikileaks's release of US military documents.",Friday 14 April 2017,14-Apr-17,Wikileaks 'hostile to US' - CIA chief,"The anti-secrecy organisation is abetted by states such as Russia, Mike Pompeo says.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39597055

"Syria chemical attack 'fabricated' - Assad Syria's President Bashar al-Assad says reports of a chemical attack by his forces were ""100% fabrication"". In an exclusive video interview with AFP news agency, he said ""there was no order to make any attack"". More than 80 people were killed in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April, and hundreds suffered symptoms consistent with a nerve agent. Witnesses said they saw warplanes attack the town but Russia says a rebel depot of chemical munitions was hit. Shocking footage showed victims - many of them children - convulsing and foaming at the mouth. Sufferers were taken to hospitals across the border in Turkey. Syria 'chemical attack': What we know The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said on Thursday that allegations of a chemical attack were ""credible"" based on a preliminary examination of the evidence. Mr Assad accused the West of making up events in Khan Sheikhoun so it had an excuse to carry out missile strikes on the government's Shayrat airbase, which took place a few days after the alleged attack. ""It's stage one, the play [they staged] that we saw on social network and TVs, then propaganda and then stage two, the military attack,"" he told the AFP, questioning the authenticity of the video footage. Mr Assad also said the Syrian government had given up its chemical arsenal in 2013, adding ""even if we have them, we wouldn't use them"". Since 2013, there have been continued allegations that chemicals such as chlorine and ammonia have been used against civilians, by both the Syrian government and rebel groups. Turkey and the UK say tests show Sarin or a Sarin-like substance was used in Khan Sheikhoun, which would be the first time since 2013 that a prohibited chemical had been used on such a scale. President Assad's flat denial that his country has used chemical weapons and that last week's incident was a fabrication concocted by al-Qaeda and Washington does not square with the ""case for the prosecution"".  Indeed it sits uneasily with the Russian version of events which says that a rebel warehouse was hit by a bomb from a Syrian warplane thus releasing the chemical agent.  President Assad's denials must contend with the fact that samples from some of the victims were analysed in Turkey and the results indicated a Sarin-like agent was used.  Then there is the detailed narrative, provided by the Americans who tracked the aircraft they say launched the attack, from its base, to the target location, and then home again.  There are too the many videos that were released immediately after the attack showing the victims. Their timing and location have been verified by independent researchers.  UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday it was ""highly likely"" the Assad regime was behind the attack. ""Apart from anything else, we believe it's the only regime that has the capability to make such an attack,"" she added.  Turkey, which treated many of the wounded, says it has ""concrete evidence"" Sarin was used. The US, UK and France reacted angrily on Wednesday after Russia, Syria's key ally, vetoed a draft UN resolution condemning the alleged chemical attack. It is the eighth time Russia has cast a veto at the UN Security Council over the Syrian conflict. However, both the Turkish and Russian leaders have agreed, in a telephone conversation, to support the OPCW investigation. Mr Assad told AFP that he would only allow an ""impartial"" investigation, involving ""unbiased countries... to make sure that they won't use it for politicised purposes. The US had, until its Shayrat attack, limited its involvement in Syria to removing the so-called Islamic State (IS) from its stronghold in the city of Raqqa. The Pentagon admitted on Thursday that it accidentally killed 18 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces, its ally in the fight against IS, in an airstrike on Monday, just south of the town of Tabqa, some 40km (25 miles) from Raqqa.

"Canada unveils plans to legalise recreational marijuana Canada has laid out its plan to legalise the sale of recreational marijuana by June 2018. If it passes, the country will be the largest developed nation to end marijuana prohibition. The law was tabled on Thursday, and would allow adults over 18 to possess up to 30g of dried marijuana. The proposed legislation would allow the federal government to license producers, but provinces would be in charge of regulating consumer sale. Other issues, such as pricing, taxation and packaging must still be worked out.  ""This is a very important day, I've spent most of my adult life keeping children and communities safe,"" said MP Bill Blair during a press conference shortly after the legislation was presented to parliament. The former police chief had chaired the government's cannabis task force, which laid out a blueprint for legal recreational pot in Canada.  The government is pitching the legislation as a way to keep pot out of the hands of minors and undercut organised crime.  The law would increase penalties for those who sell to children, and revamp impaired driving laws to make it easier to prosecute people who drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  It would allow police to test people's saliva if they think a driver has been using marijuana. The current legal prohibitions have been an ""abject failure"" at keeping the children from getting a hold of marijuana, says Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale.  Canada has some of the highest marijuana use in the world, according to the task force, especially amongst young people. About 30% of people aged 20-24 use cannabis. The new framework would make it illegal to market marijuana products to children, or sell to anyone under 18. Provinces could raise the minimum age of consumption if they choose, the government says. New laws would also increase the penalty for people who sell to the under-aged, as well as create a new offence for people ""exploiting children in the trafficking of cannabis"".  Trafficking cannabis outside the government's new legal framework would remain illegal.  Initially, only fresh and dried cannabis, cannabis oils, seeds and plants would be licensed for sale, but adults could grow up to four plants and make edibles at home for their personal use. Marijuana won't become legal overnight. The government still has to debate the bill and provinces will have to draft their own regulations for sale.  ""There's still a lot of questions,"" said Lynne Belle-Isle, who works for the Centre for Addictions Research. Ms Belle-Isle participated in the task force's public consultations, and said she's happy with the government's focus on health and safety.  ""We agree that legalisation is the way to go, I think criminalisation is a lot more harmful,"" she said. One thing her organisation has been pushing for is to have the sale of marijuana contained to government-controlled stores that enforce minimum pricing. The system is already used in many provinces for hard alcohol, and she said research shows it cuts down on abuse. In a report released on Tuesday, the CD Howe Institute warned that if the cost is too high, it would do little to undercut the illicit market, but if it is too low, it could encourage consumption and fail to generate significant government revenue.  Mr Goodale advised that, in the meantime, police will enforce existing marijuana laws. ""This is an orderly transition, not a free-for-all,"" he admonished.  Illegal pot dispensaries have sprouted up in cities across Canada in the last few years, especially in Vancouver and Toronto.  Many have been regularly raided by police and two prominent marijuana activists and retailers - Marc and Jodie Emery - were recently arrested and charged with a number of offences including drug trafficking.

"Trump's Mar-a-Lago kitchen cited for food safety violations Health and safety inspectors have found more than a dozen violations in the kitchen of the Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, owned by President Donald Trump. The 13 issues included broken fridges which meant that meat and fish were kept at temperatures deemed unsafe.  Tap water was not warm enough to properly sanitise employees' hands, and a shelf in a walk-in freezer was covered in rust. The initiation fee at the private club is $200,000 (£159,000).

"Canada unveils plans to legalise recreational marijuana Canada has laid out its plan to legalise the sale of recreational marijuana by June 2018. If it passes, the country will be the largest developed nation to end marijuana prohibition. The law was tabled on Thursday, and would allow adults over 18 to possess up to 30g of dried marijuana. The proposed legislation would allow the federal government to license producers, but provinces would be in charge of regulating consumer sale. Other issues, such as pricing, taxation and packaging must still be worked out.  ""This is a very important day, I've spent most of my adult life keeping children and communities safe,"" said MP Bill Blair during a press conference shortly after the legislation was presented to parliament.

"Pakistan student killed over 'blasphemy' on university campus A university student in Pakistan accused of blasphemy against Islam has been killed by a mob of fellow students on campus, police say. Many students have been arrested after the brutal attack in the northern city of Mardan, and the campus has been closed. Reports suggest that two young men were accused of posting offensive content on Facebook. One survived with injuries. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive and incendiary issue in Pakistan. Critics say blasphemy laws, which allow the death penalty in some cases, are often misused to oppress minorities. There have been other cases where people accused of it have been killed by an angry crowd. The murdered student has been identified as Mashal Khan, who studied journalism. Some reports say he was shot, while others say he was beaten to death with planks. ""He was badly tortured after being shot at a close range... He was beaten with sticks, bricks and hands,"" senior police official Niaz Saeed told the AFP news agency. Hundreds of people were involved, the officer said. Graphic video footage of the incident has emerged online. Police had not been investigating the two accused men, nor had any case been filed against them, and the mob appeared to have acted on rumours, the Dawn newspaper reports. Last month Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif voiced his support for a wide-ranging crackdown on blasphemous content on social media. In a statement on his party's official Twitter account, he described blasphemy as an ""unpardonable offence"". An official at Abdul Wali Khan University who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr Khan was disliked by other students for his liberal and secular views.  At least 65 people have been murdered in Pakistan after being accused of blasphemy since 1990, a recent think tank report said.

"Senior New York judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam found dead in Hudson River US judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, the first black woman to serve in New York's highest court, has been found dead in the city's Hudson River. New York police said they pulled the 65-year-old from the water and pronounced her dead on Wednesday after being alerted by an emergency call. Her husband had reported her missing, police said. They are reportedly treating the death as a possible suicide but an investigation is ongoing.  The body was fully clothed and showed no signs of trauma or criminality, police said. Her husband told police she had not been heard from since Tuesday morning. Born Sheila Turner in Washington DC in 1952, she graduated from Columbia Law School and worked for low-income people in Brooklyn before later serving as a New York state assistant attorney general. She was widely reported to have been the country's first female Muslim judge. However her surname, which she kept for her career, came from her first husband. The New York Times quotes Court of Appeals spokesman Gary Spencer as saying she had told him that she was not Muslim. Ms Abdus-Salaam was appointed to the New York Court of Appeals by Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2013. ""Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam was a trailblazing jurist whose life in public service was in pursuit of a more fair and more just New York for all,"" Mr Cuomo said in a statement. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called her death ""an enormous loss for New York, our judiciary, and all who knew, respected and loved her"".

"China fears North Korea-US conflict 'at any moment' China has warned that ""conflict could break out at any moment"" as tension over North Korea increases. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said if war occurred there could be no winner. Mr Wang's comments come as the US voices increasing concern at North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and deploys a Navy carrier group off the Korean peninsula. China, North Korea's only backer, fears conflict could cause the regime to collapse and problems on its border. Mr Wang said: ""One has the feeling that a conflict could break out at any moment.  ""I think that all relevant parties should be highly vigilant with regards to this situation."" ""We call on all parties to refrain from provoking and threatening each other, whether in words or actions, and not let the situation get to an irreversible and unmanageable stage."" Adding to Chinese unease, President Donald Trump said on Thursday that ""the problem of North Korea"" would be ""taken care of"". ""If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A."" The North Korean military responded on Friday by saying it would ""mercilessly foil"" any US provocation. ""Our toughest counteraction against the U.S. and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive,"" read a statement from the army, reported in English by North Korea's official news agency, KCNA. The US president has recently demonstrated his willingness to resort to military methods. He ordered a cruise missile attack on Syria in retaliation for a suspected chemical weapons attack, and the US military just used a huge bomb against so-called Islamic State in Afghanistan.  Washington is concerned North Korea might develop the ability to launch a nuclear weapon at the US.  Mr Trump and China's President Xi Jinping have been in contact by phone since their summit last week in Florida, and Reuters quotes US officials as saying tougher economic sanctions against North Korea are also being considered.  China is concerned any conflict could lead to a huge refugee problem on its border with North Korea. It also fears the collapse of the North Korean regime, which would remove a buffer between China and a country with US military bases, and has thus long been wary of pushing Pyongyang too hard. But, in a sign of growing frustration with its neighbour, it recently blocked coal imports from the North. And Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reports that the government will suspend direct Air China flights between Beijing and Pyongyang from Monday 17 April. There is also intense speculation that North Korea could carry out a sixth nuclear bomb test or another missile launch - possibly a long-range missile - on Saturday.  Saturday marks the 105th anniversary of the birth of its first leader, Kim Il-sung.  In an interview with the Associated Press, North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Han Song Ryol accused the Trump administration of ""becoming more vicious and more aggressive"" in its policy towards the North.  An institute linked to the North Korean foreign ministry also warned that ""thermo-nuclear war may break out any moment"".

"Jerusalem stabbing: Tributes paid to Hannah Bladon The University of Birmingham says it is ""deeply saddened"" by the death of its student Hannah Bladon. Ms Bladon, 20, was stabbed to death on a tram in Jerusalem on Good Friday. She was on an exchange at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which expressed ""deep sorrow"" over her death.  Ms Bladon was stabbed several times in the chest while she travelled on a tram in Tzahal Square and died in hospital. A 57-year-old Palestinian man was detained at the scene.  Ms Bladon had been taking classes in bible studies, archaeology, and Hebrew at the Rothberg International School, part of the Hebrew University. The school said: ""Her friends described her as an inquisitive and adventurous student who made the most of her opportunity to learn and experience life in Israel."" The University of Birmingham said: ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends during this tragic time and we will be providing support for any student affected by this terrible event."" Police say the suspect, a resident of Ras al-Amud in east Jerusalem, was recently released from a psychiatric hospital.  Jerusalem police chief Yoram Halevy told the AFP news agency that the man was ""very mentally disturbed"". An off-duty policeman travelling on the tram pulled an emergency brake and then tackled the attacker, with the help of another passenger.  He told the AFP news agency: ""I was travelling with my family when I heard the cries of 'attack, attack'. ""I sounded the alarm then rushed to the scene of the attack. We overpowered him."" A 30-year-old pregnant woman and a 50-year-old man were also injured in the attack.  BBC Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman said the pair were either hurt when the tram came to a sudden stop or in the panic to get away.  A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm the tragic death of a British national in Jerusalem. ""We are providing support to her family at this difficult time and are in touch with local authorities."" There will continue to be heightened security in Jerusalem after measures were brought in ahead of the Jewish Passover Festival and Easter celebrations.

"MOAB strike: US military defends use of massive bomb in Afghanistan The top US military commander in Afghanistan says the decision to use a powerful bomb in the country was based purely on tactical considerations.  Gen John Nicholson said the most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in combat had been the right weapon to target a suspected Islamic State (IS) base in Nangarhar province. A 300m (328yds) long network of tunnels and caves was destroyed, he said.   The US coordinated the attack with Afghanistan, Afghan officials said. About 36 suspected militants were killed, according to Afghan officials, but IS has denied suffering any casualties.   Known as the ""mother of all bombs"", or MOAB, the device was dropped on Thursday evening by an MC-130 transport plane, falling in Nangarhar's Achin district. Chief Executive of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with his government  and ""great care had been taken to avoid civilian harm"". When IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015, it was the first time the group had officially spread outside the Arab world. ""The enemy had created bunkers, tunnels and extensive mine fields, and this weapon was used to reduce those obstacles so that we could continue our offensive in southern Nangarhar,"" said Gen Nicholson. US and Afghan forces at the site saw ""no evidence of civilian casualties"", he added. US President Donald Trump called the strike ""another successful job"". Local eyewitness Qari Mehrajuddin first saw ""lightning like a thunder storm"" followed by the roar of an explosion, he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""I thought there was a bombing just outside my home,"" he added but, in reality, the blast was around 5km (three miles) away, according to Reuters. The 21,600lb (9,800kg) bomb also destroyed a large stash of weapons, the Afghan defence ministry says. IS commander Siddiq Yar was among those killed, presidential spokesman Shah Hussain Murtazawi told the BBC. IS fighters in the tunnels had ""come from Pakistan and were persecuting people in the local area"", he added. Massive blast area - Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent The clue is in the ungainly name - the MOAB or GBU-43/B massive ordnance air blast is the US military's most destructive conventional (that is non-nuclear) bomb.  It is a huge weapon and is GPS-guided. It was dropped from a MC-130 aircraft - the US Special Forces variant of the Hercules transport. The weapon is carried on a special cradle inside the aircraft from which it is extracted by a parachute. Its principal effect is a massive blast over a huge area. It is a larger version of weapons used during the Vietnam War.  The Trump administration's policy towards Afghanistan remains under consideration but the use of this weapon sends a powerful signal that IS is top of the administration's target list wherever its offshoots may be found. Achin district governor Ismail Shinwary told the BBC that Afghan special forces, with the help of American air support, had begun anti-IS operations in the area 13 days ago. He said IS targets had been bombed regularly but ""last night's bombarding was very powerful... the biggest I have ever seen"". A member of an anti-IS group in the area who gave his name only as Mohammad told the BBC all civilians had left the area since the start of the anti-IS operations. Achin resident Mir Alam Shinwari told Reuters that IS were ""not human beings, they are savages"".

"Borussia Dortmund bombs: Letters at scene 'not from Islamists' Investigators in Germany say there is ""significant doubt"" that Tuesday's attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus was the work of radical Islamists. They say letters found at the scene may be an attempt to trick people into thinking there was an Islamist motive. But they said it may have been the work of political extremists - from the left or right - or violent football fans. Two people received medical treatment after three bombs exploded near the team bus, shattering glass. Spanish footballer Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack, Borussia Dortmund's Champion's League match against Monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led Dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. On Wednesday, a 25-year-old Iraqi ""with Islamist links"" was arrested. But the three identical letters found near the scene - which said the attack was done ""in the name of Allah"" - may be fakes, intended to pin the blame on radical Islamists. The developments came to light when  two German state broadcasters - NDR and WDR - together with the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported the study on Friday. When asked to comment, state prosecutor Frauke Köhler agreed the media reports were ""accurate"". They highlight that ""many things"" from the letters are ""untypical"" for groups like so-called Islamic State (IS). These include a claim that sportspeople and other famous figures were in danger unless the Ramstein Air Base is closed and German warplanes withdrew from Syria. IS normally does not negotiate in such a way, Ms Köhler added. The Ramstein Air Base in southern Germany is a US base and a centre of drone operations. Anonymous security experts quoted in the Süddeutsche piece (in German) say the text of the letters was likely written by a native German speaker who built in mistakes to make it look like it was written by someone for whom German was their second language. Investigators were still not clear about what kind of attacker might have wished to frame Islamists for an attack, but said the explosives used in the attack were professionally-made. And another German newspaper, Tagesspiegel, said it had received an email from someone with right-wing motives, who said the attack was a warning and made racist threats. The authorities are taking that email seriously, the newspaper reported.",Saturday 15 April 2017,15-Apr-17,Doubt over Islamist link to Dortmund bombs,Investigators believe the attackers may have been political extremists or violent football fans.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39603467
"US elite school Choate Rosemary Hall 'sorry' over sexual abuse Students at an elite boarding school in the US were sexually abused by at least 12 members of staff over a period of four decades, according to a report. Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut, which includes former President John F Kennedy among its alumni, published the findings following an investigation. Allegations of abuse dating from the 1960s were handled internally at the school, the report said. The school acknowledged the findings, adding: ""We profoundly apologise."" ""The conduct of these adults violated the foundation of our community: the sacred trust between students and the adults charged with their care,"" the school said. The apology comes after the boarding school, which US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka also attended, launched an independent investigation into historic reports of ""adult sexual misconduct with students"". It said that after asking people to come forward with information relating to the allegations, it ""received numerous calls and emails"". The earliest incidents recorded concerned conduct from the early 1960s, with faculty members at the school allegedly abusing students until as recently as 2010.  The greatest number of recorded incidents took place in the 1980s, according to the report. There were no reports of sexual misconduct involving current members of staff. In an incident reported in 1999, a Spanish language teacher is alleged to have raped a 17-year-old female student in a swimming pool during a school trip abroad, the report said. In some instances the school, which dealt with the misconduct internally rather than involving the police, ""moved quickly and decisively,"" the report said. But in other cases, it was ""slow to respond"" and allowed the accused member of staff to ""remain at the school for a considerable length of time"". ""Many of the Choate graduates who reported incidents to us did not tell any adult at the school at the time of the incidents,"" it added.  The school said that some students did not report the abuse because they did not recognise it as such or ""did not want the school to find out"". The investigation found that the school knew that faculty members engaged in ""intimate kissing"" and ""intimate touching"" with male and female students, but reported none of the incidents to police. ""Our investigation further showed that when reports of sexual misconduct were substantiated by the Choate administration, sexual misconduct matters were handled internally and quietly.  ""Even when a teacher was terminated or resigned in the middle of the school year because he or she had engaged in sexual misconduct with a student, the rest of the faculty was told little and sometimes nothing about the teacher's departure and, when told, was cautioned to say nothing about the situation if asked."" The school said that it had released the report to fulfil its ""pledge to be at the forefront of the highest standard of care in preventing and addressing adult sexual misconduct"".",Saturday 15 April 2017,15-Apr-17,US elite school 'sorry' for years of abuse,"Students at an elite school in Connecticut were sexually abused for over four decades, a report says.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39604353
"Chechnya anti-gay violence: Newspaper fears 'retribution' for reports The Russian daily Novaya Gazeta says it is alarmed by a Chechen Muslim call for ""retribution"" after the paper reported violence against gay men in Chechnya. Chechen Muslim clerics met on 3 April, two days after the paper's revelations, and said the report had insulted their faith and the dignity of Chechen men. ""Retribution will catch up with the true instigators, wherever and whoever they are,"" their resolution said. Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for ""reprisals against journalists"". ""We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,"" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed.  The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true.  Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. ""All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,"" said Natalia Poplevskaya.  Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them ""lies"". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that ""retribution"" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.   ""There will be retribution!"" he told the Russian news website RBC. ""Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics."" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters.   In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.  ""We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,"" he wrote, urging dialogue.  Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses.

"Egypt's shaken Copts mark Good Friday after double bombing The head of the Coptic Christian Church has led a Good Friday service in the cathedral in Cairo in the aftermath of last Sunday's deadly bomb attacks.  Pope Tawadros II had been in one of the two churches targeted on Palm Sunday when 45 people were killed in attacks claimed by so-called Islamic State. Security has been tightened at churches across Egypt and Easter celebrations have been scaled back. Both suicide bombers were Egyptians, the government said. A three-month state of emergency was imposed following the bombings in Alexandria and the Nile Delta city of Tanta. The attacks on Christians, who make up about 10% of Egypt's population, raised security fears ahead of a visit to Cairo by Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, scheduled for 28 and 29 April. In a visit to Pope Tawadros, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi vowed to hunt down those who had organised the bombings.  Good Friday is the day Christians commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. ""With these incidents we are now living with Christ in his pain,"" Coptic Bishop Kirillos told AFP news agency. ""Given the current circumstances and our solidarity with the families of the dead, we are going to limit our celebrations to Easter Mass,"" the Church said in a statement. There would be no decorations in churches and rooms normally reserved for the reception of worshippers wishing to exchange season's greetings would remain closed, an official at the Coptic patriarchate told AFP. Another Coptic bishop, Macarius, told Reuters news agency earlier that the Church wanted greater guarantees of security. ""We can consider ourselves in a wave of persecution but the Church has gone through a lot in 20 centuries,"" he said. ""There are waves of persecution. It reaches to the highest point like a pyramid and then it goes down again. We are at a very high point."" Victims of the attacks will be mourned at Masses on Saturday night. The bombers were both identified as coming from the southern province of Qena. One used to work for a petroleum company and was linked to a cell that carried out the attack on a Cairo church last December, in which 25 people were killed. He blew himself up after being stopped by police at the gates of St Mark's Cathedral in Alexandria, where Pope Tawadros was leading a Palm Sunday service. The other bomber was identified as a member of a ""terrorist"" cell. Meanwhile, in the province of Minya, Muslims fought with Christians who had tried praying in an abandoned home in a village on Thursday, AFP reports.   The Muslims then set fire to four nearby homes, police officials were quoted as saying.

"Islamic State mufti killed in Mosul air strike, Iraqi forces say One of the most senior religious leaders in the Islamic State (IS) group has been killed in west Mosul, according to Iraqi forces.  Abdullah al-Badrani, also known as Abu Ayoub al-Atar, reportedly died in an air strike by the US-led coalition on Thursday. Al-Badrani issued many of the group's dictates, leading to the torture, death and sexual abuse of civilians.  Iraqi security forces are trying to retake al-Nuri mosque in the old city. The Islamic State group has made its name feared and reviled through the very public atrocities and human rights abuses it has committed against whole communities.  Abu Ayoub al-Atar was infamous in Mosul and beyond for the religious decisions - or fatwas - he issued that permitted some of these acts.   He is believed to have given the justification for the enslavement and sexual abuse of women from the Yazidi minority in northern Iraq.   More recently, he has given the authority for IS to continue to attack civilians in the eastern side of Mosul, which Iraqi forces have recaptured.  He called the civilians apostates who deserve to be killed. The Iraqi government has issued instructions to civilians on how to stay safe as forces continue their assault on the IS-held western side of the city. Al-Nuri mosque is a significant target as it is where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi first appeared after the declaration of caliphate across parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014.",Saturday 15 April 2017,15-Apr-17,IS religious leader 'killed in Mosul',"The militants lose one of their most infamous religious leaders in an air strike, Iraqi forces say.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39603491
"White House to keep visitor logs secret President Donald Trump will not release logs of those who visit the White House, reversing his predecessor's voluntary disclosure policy.  The White House cited ""grave national security risks and privacy concerns"" as the reason for its decision. Former President Barack Obama voluntarily disclosed more than 6 million records during his presidency. Critics say the logs allow for monitoring of individuals or groups who may be trying to influence policy. White House Communications Director Michael Dubke said the administration is following a 2013 federal court ruling that found most of the logs are considered presidential records and are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). He argued Mr Trump has taken steps to improve ethics such as imposing new restrictions on lobbying and opening to the White House news briefing room to outlets that previously did not have access.  Senior White House officials also contend Mr Trump's new policy mirrors what previous administrations have done before Mr Obama. The Obama administration began releasing visitor records in September 2009 in response to legal challenges.  The policy had some exceptions, which included private visits to the Obama family and those in attendance for ""sensitive meetings"", such as potential Supreme Court nominees.  But the records were not made available immediately and sometimes took months before they appeared online.  White House lawyers also redacted names for national security concerns and other reasons before the logs were made public.  In 2012, Mr Trump criticised Mr Obama for concealing names.  Under the new directive, records of those entering the White House complex will be kept confidential until at least five years after Mr Trump leaves office.  But White House agencies such as the Office of Management and Budget and the US Trade Representative may be subject to Freedom Of Information Requests.  Earlier this week, a coalition of watchdog groups filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration with the aim of publishing the visitor records. The Obama administration published the logs on a White House-maintained web page. Since Mr Trump took office, the page has been shuttered.  White House officials said on Friday they would no longer maintain the web page and said it would save taxpayers $70,000 (£55,867) by 2020.  Democratic lawmakers have also proposed legislation that would require the Trump administration to disclose the names of visitors at other places where he conducts business, including his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.  Mr Trump has been widely criticised for his lack of transparency. He has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, breaking with decades of precedent.  Thousands of protesters are expected to march on Saturday in cities across the US calling on Mr Trump to release his personal tax returns.

"United Airlines passenger 'stung by scorpion' on flight A Canadian man says he was stung by a scorpion while travelling in business class on a United Airlines flight. Richard Bell said the scorpion fell from the overhead bin and onto his head during lunch on a trip from Houston, Texas to Calgary in Canada. After putting it on his plate, he was stung. United has offered compensation. It happened on Sunday, the same day a United passenger was violently dragged from a plane after refusing to give his seat to a staff member. Video of the incident has been watched by millions of people online. Dr David Dao, a 69-year-old Vietnamese-American, lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose and a ""significant"" concussion in the incident. Mr Bell, who was travelling with his wife, Linda, told CBC: ""While I was eating, something fell in my hair from the overhead above me. ""I picked it up, and it was a scorpion. And I was holding it out by the tail, so it couldn't really sting me then."" A fellow passenger, he said, warned him that the creature was a scorpion and could be dangerous. ""So I dropped it on my plate and then I went to pick it up again, and that's when it stung me. It got my nail, mostly,"" he said  Mr Bell flicked the scorpion on to the floor and a flight attendant covered it with a cup before throwing it away in the bathroom. A nurse who happened to be on board gave him a painkiller as a precaution, he said. When the plane landed in Calgary he was taken to a hospital, and later released after being cleared of any medical issue. Mr Bell said he had no plans to launch a lawsuit. United Airlines has offered the couple flying credit as compensation, CBC reports. In the incident with Dr Dao, law enforcement officials were called after he refused to leave the overbooked plane travelling from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, saying he needed to get home to see his patients. Dr Dao's lawyers have filed an emergency court request for the airline to preserve evidence ahead of a hearing on Monday. He was released on Wednesday night from a Chicago hospital, his lawyer said, adding that he planned to have reconstructive surgery.",Saturday 15 April 2017,15-Apr-17,Man 'stung by scorpion' on United flight,The alleged incident occurred on the same day a passenger was dragged off a different United flight.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39599999
"N Korea missile launch fails day after military parade A North Korean missile has detonated soon after launch, South Korean and US military officials have said, a day after Pyongyang warned the US amid rising tension in the region. The US said a ballistic missile exploded within seconds of launch. Hours earlier, North Korea paraded what appeared to be long-range ballistic missiles at a major military display. It has already conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in contravention of UN resolutions. The latest development came as US Vice-President Mike Pence arrived in the South Korean capital, Seoul, where he was expected to discuss the best way to deal with North Korea's missile and nuclear programmes. Mr Pence, beginning a long-planned 10-day Asia trip, his first official visit to the region, addressed US soldiers at an Easter service, telling them that the commitment to South Korea had ""never been stronger"".  The South Korean defence ministry said that ""North Korea attempted to test an unidentified type of missile from [its eastern port of] Sinpo"". It added that the launch on Sunday had ""failed"".  The US Pacific Command later confirmed the failed test, adding that it had detected and tracked what it believed to be a North Korean ballistic missile. ""The missile blew up almost immediately,"" said US Navy Commander Dave Benham, quoted by Reuters. One unnamed US official said it was unlikely to have been an intercontinental (ICBM) missile, but investigations were continuing. Ballistic missiles follow high trajectories and are initially powered and guided, but fall to their target under gravity. ICBMs follow a sub-orbital trajectory, others stay within the atmosphere. North Korea frequently tests missiles, in contravention of UN resolutions. The success rate has been improving but its record is still hit and miss. This failure underlines that Saturday's huge parade in Pyongyang of rows and rows of missiles of different types does not mean the country yet has an effective nuclear arsenal. Recently, the US has reacted minimally to news of North Korean military exploits. This might be taken as ""the time for words is over, now is the time for action"". But what action?   The US is aware of the potential cost of attacking North Korea, given that Seoul is within easy range of North Korean artillery. And China would be unlikely to stand aside if an attempt were made to topple Kim Jong-un (though the US has said that regime change is not an aim). So what action might President Trump take? Only he knows the answer to that - or perhaps he does not. On Saturday, North Korea marked the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founding president, Kim Il-sung, with a huge military parade in Pyongyang amid speculation that current leader Kim Jong-un could order a new nuclear test. The event appeared to include new intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. ""North Korea showing a variety of offensive missiles at yesterday's military parade and daring to fire a ballistic missile today is a show of force that threatens the whole world,"" South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement. Adding to the tension in the Korean peninsula, a US aircraft carrier group is steaming towards the region. Washington has stepped up pressure on the isolated North, with President Donald Trump saying that the US is ready to act alone to deal with the nuclear threat. At the parade on Saturday, North Korean military official Choe Ryong-hae, who is believed to be the country's second most powerful official, said that his country was ""prepared to respond to an all-out war with an all-out war"". ""We are ready to hit back with nuclear attacks of our own style against any nuclear attacks,"" he said. North Korea has suffered test failures in the past but they have not deterred its development programme. Pyongyang resident Rim Chung-ryol told Reuters: ""If the news is true, failure is the mother of success. We will make more efforts to make even more powerful weapons in the future."" North Korea's aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM that can reach targets around the world. Pyongyang has claimed to have miniaturised nuclear warheads for use on missiles, though experts have cast doubt on that given the lack of evidence. The state is banned from any missile or nuclear tests by the UN, though it has repeatedly broken those sanctions. Earlier this month, North Korea test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile from Sinpo into the Sea of Japan. The launch took place on the eve of a visit by China's President Xi Jinping to the US to meet Mr Trump. The two later discussed how to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes. On Friday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that the situation in the region was escalating, adding that ""conflict could break out at any moment"".

"Trump tax march: Thousands urge president to release finances Protests have been taking place in more than 150 locations across the United States to call on President Donald Trump to release his tax returns. Mr Trump broke a long-held tradition by not releasing his paperwork during his presidential campaign. His critics want to know who he has been dealing with and if there are any conflicts of interest.  The protests were timed to coincide with the traditional mid-April deadline for Americans to file their returns. At least 21 people were arrested in Berkeley, California, in clashes between Trump opponents and supporters at a separate free speech rally. There is no law requiring presidents to release their tax returns, but Mr Trump has found himself under public pressure and  some information from a 2005 tax return was leaked to the media last month.  ""I think it is critical we know about his investments, his donations and any entanglements he has,"" said one protester, Chuck Wash, at a march in Washington DC. The idea for the themed march came from law professor Jennifer Taub, who was angered when presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said President Trump would not be releasing his tax returns because ""people don't care"".  In January, Ms Taub tweeted of the need for a nationwide protest to show the president that many people do care.  The idea quickly caught on.  ""I wanted to express myself and never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be standing here today, seeing this idea that I tweeted out in January come to life,"" she told the BBC at the Washington DC march.  Ms Taub said the march had broader aims than just wanting to see the president's paperwork.  ""This is also about having a tax system that is fair,"" she said. ""Both in terms of making sure everyone pays their fair share and also in taking public resources - our taxes - and spending them on things that make everyone flourish."" She said less should be spent on wars, and more should go to public service television and the Meals on Wheels programme, which Mr Trump has made funding cuts to in the first months of his presidency. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, was also at the march in Washington DC. She said the Trump administration has a ""huge"" transparency problem.  ""He [Trump] talked about draining the swamp and making everything transparent. He lied again,"" said Ms Waters. She also criticised Friday's announcement that President Donald Trump will not release the logs of those who visit the White House. The White House cited ""grave national security risks and privacy concerns"" as the reason for its decision, reversing former President Barack Obama's voluntary disclosure policy. Participants used the hashtag #showusyourtaxes to share their images on social media.  President Trump's supporters have also gone online to express their support for the president. One Twitter user accused protesters of ""flogging a dead horse"" and many said they had no interest in seeing the returns.  Separately, more than a dozen people were arrested in Berkeley, California, after supporters of Mr Trump clashed with anti-fascist demonstrators at a free speech rally, police said. Several people were injured when fighting broke out at a park in the city as opponents and supporters of the US president met on the streets during Saturday's protests, according to CNN.  Footage shared on social media showed crowds of people throwing items at one another and demonstrators being attacked with what appeared to be chemical sprays and makeshift weapons.  The incident occurred after hundreds of anti-Trump protesters staged a counter-rally alongside an event billed as a ""Patriots Day free speech rally and picnic"", organised by the president's supporters.

"Syria war: Huge bomb kills dozens of evacuees in Syria A huge car bomb has blasted a convoy of coaches carrying evacuees from besieged government-held towns in Syria, killing about 75 people, state media said. It shattered coaches and set cars on fire, leaving a trail of bodies including children, as the convoy waited in rebel territory near Aleppo. There were fears of revenge attacks on evacuees from rebel-held towns, being moved under a deal. But the exchange later resumed, with coaches reaching safety on both sides. The ""Four Towns"" deal brokered by Iran and Qatar was meant to relieve suffering in besieged towns - Foah and Kefraya in the north-west which are under government control, and rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani, near Damascus.  Some 20,000 besieged people would be taken out in all. According to AFP news agency, up to 5,000 government evacuees and 2,200 from rebel towns had been stranded in transit on Sunday.  Last month, the UN described the situation in the besieged towns  as ""catastrophic"". More than 64,000 civilians are ""trapped in a cycle of daily violence and deprivation"", it said. The bomb reportedly went off at Rashidin, west of government-held Aleppo, at around 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) at the checkpoint where the handover was due to take place. A suicide bomber driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies blew it up near the coaches, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports. ""A van was distributing crisps,"" one civilian evacuee told Zaman English News. ""Children started running after it. It then exploded."" At least 45 body bags were counted at the scene of the blast, while White Helmets rescuers, who operate in rebel-held areas, said at least 100 people had been killed. Many were also injured. Images from the scene show bodies lying on the ground outside blackened and devastated vehicles. Most of the dead were evacuees but they also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses, the Observatory says. Convoys on both sides had been held up overnight, but by Saturday evening 15 coaches from the government towns had arrived at their destination in Ramouseh while between 25 and 30 carrying evacuees from the rebel towns had reached Rashidin.  Rebels had accused the government of breaching the terms of the deal, accusing it of trying to bring out more loyalist fighters than agreed, along with civilians. According to a 24Aleppo tweet, a special unit of the Russian army surrounded the convoy from the rebel-held towns after the bombing and closed the road there to ""prevent any reaction"".  Evacuees from Madaya heard the blast from a bus garage where they had been waiting in Ramouseh, just a few miles away, Reuters news agency reports. They called on international organisations to protect them from any possible retaliation, saying they condemned the attack on the other convoy. Madaya resident Ahmed, 24, told Reuters earlier that evacuees had been waiting without drinking water or food at a since Friday night. The Madaya and Zabadani evacuees are going to rebel-held territory in Idlib province.  Many people are reported to have died as a result of shortages of food or medicine in the four towns. Foah and Kefraya, most of whose residents are Shia Muslims, have been encircled by rebels and al Qaeda-linked Sunni Muslim jihadists since March 2015. Madaya and Zabadani, which are predominantly Sunni Muslim, have been besieged since June 2015 by the Syrian army and fighters from Lebanon's Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement. A previous attempt at mutual evacuations failed in December when rebels burnt coaches due to be sent to the towns. More than 300,000 people have lost their lives and millions of people have been displaced since a peaceful uprising against President Bashar al-Assad six years ago turned into a full-scale civil war. More than 80 people were killed in a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, in the north-west, on 4 April, prompting the US to bomb a government air base with missiles. Russia and Iran also have military forces deployed in the country, backing President Assad. Rescue workers from both the government and rebel sides worked at the scene of Saturday's attack. ""Today, rebels and regime, Sunnis and Shias shed blood, sweat and tears together to save #Syria children,"" tweeted BBC producer Riam Dalati. ""Maybe not all is lost, yet.""",Sunday 16 April 2017,16-Apr-17,Bomb kills dozens of Syrian evacuees,"A blast rips through buses carrying people from pro-government towns, waiting at a rebel checkpoint.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39609288
"Turkey referendum: Campaigning ends ahead of landmark vote The final day of campaigning in Turkey has ended ahead of a referendum on whether to grant sweeping new powers to the president. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking to replace the parliamentary system with an executive presidency. Approval could see him stay in office until 2029. Supporters say a ""yes"" vote would streamline and modernise the country; opponents fear the move would lead to increasingly authoritarian rule. If the referendum vote falls in Mr Erdogan's favour, it would give him vastly enhanced powers to appoint cabinet ministers, issue decrees, choose senior judges and dissolve parliament. The campaign, which has polarised the country, could bring about the biggest change to the governing system since the modern republic was founded almost a century ago. It takes place under a state of emergency which was imposed following a failed coup last July. A government crackdown since then has seen tens of thousands of people arrested. President Erdogan told supporters at one of his final rallies on Saturday in Istanbul's Tuzla district: ""The new constitution will bring stability and trust that is needed for our country to develop and grow. Turkey can leap into the future."" Mr Erdogan assumed the presidency, a largely ceremonial position, in 2014 after more than a decade as prime minister. The referendum on constitutional change would abolish the post of prime minister, allowing the president to bring all state bureaucracy under his control. The president says the new system will resemble those in France and the US and will bring calm in a time of turmoil marked by a Kurdish insurgency, Islamist militancy and conflict in neighbouring Syria that has led to a huge refugee influx.  Critics fear the change would put too much power in the president's grasp, amounting to one-man rule, without the checks and balances of other presidential systems. They say his ability to retain ties to a political party - Mr Erdogan could resume leadership of the AK Party (AKP) he co-founded - would end any chance of presidential impartiality. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), told a rally in Ankara that a ""yes"" vote would endanger the whole country.

"World's oldest person, Emma Morano, dies at age of 117 The world's oldest person has died in Italy at the age of 117, reports say. Emma Morano was born on 29 November 1899 in the Piedmont region of Italy. She was officially the last person born in the 1800s still living. She had attributed her longevity to her genetics and a diet of three eggs a day, two of them raw. Ms Morano was the oldest of eight siblings, all of whom she has outlived. She died at her home in the northern city of Verbania.  Her life not only spanned three centuries but also survived an abusive marriage, the loss of her only son, two World Wars and more than 90 Italian governments. Ms Morano had admitted that her longevity was partly down to genetics: her mother reached 91 and several sisters reached their centenary. But it was also down to a rather unusual diet of three eggs - two raw - each day for more than 90 years. It was a regime she took up as a young woman, after the doctor diagnosed her with anaemia shortly after World War One. She had cut down to just two eggs a day, and a few biscuits recently. Her doctor of 27 years, Carlo Bava, had told AFP news agency that she rarely ate vegetables or fruit.  ""When I met her, she ate three eggs per day, two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon, and chicken at dinner."" Ms Morano also credited her longevity to her decision, in 1938, to kick out her husband - a year after her baby boy died at just six months old. The marriage had never been healthy, she said. She had been in love with a boy who was killed during World War One, and had no interest in marrying someone else. But, she told La Stampa newspaper in an interview when she was a spritely 112 that she was left with little choice. ""He told me: 'If you're lucky you marry me, or I'll kill you'. I was 26 years old. I got married.""  Eventually, it became too much. Though they separated in 1938, they remained married until he died in 1978. Ms Morano, who worked until she was 75, chose never to marry again. ""I didn't want to be dominated by anyone,"" she told the New York Times. She had only taken on a full-time carer a couple of years ago - but had not left her small two-room apartment for 20 years. According to the US-based Gerontology Research Group (GRG), the world's oldest registered human is now Jamaican Violet Brown, who was born on 10 March 1900.  Another 117-year-old, Elizabeth Gathoni Koinange from Kenya, recalled her long life in a BBC World Service documentary told by her great granddaughter, Priscilla Ng'ethe.",Sunday 16 April 2017,16-Apr-17,World's oldest person dies at 117,Italian Emma Morano was officially the last person born in the 1800s still living.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39610937
"April the Giraffe gives birth, finally At long, long last, after what seemed like aeons, the world's most famous giraffe has given birth. April the Giraffe, whose prolonged pregnancy has been watched by millions of amateur zoologists online, has delivered her fourth calf. ""We have a baby! Everything went absolutely perfect. This is great!"" park owner Jordan Patch said. Since a live feed of her enclosure started in February, April has become an internet celebrity. April lives at the Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, almost 200 miles north-west of New York. The park has given no details on the gender of the calf yet. The mother, whose every move has been closely followed, and baby are said to be fine. The delivery does not mean they are going away from the public's eyes. There will be a competition to determine the calf's name. Now April will raise the calf, and weaning could take between six to 10 months, the park explains. The young giraffe will then be moved to another facility for a breeding programme. April's delivery has not been without (virtual) hurdles. Her live feed was briefly removed from YouTube in February after it was flagged as being sexually explicit or having nude content. The park blamed animal rights activists for reporting the video as inappropriate, a move that infuriated her followers.

"Pakistan PM says he is shocked by blasphemy killing Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said he is ""shocked and saddened"" by the killing of a university student accused of blasphemy against Islam. He says the state will not ""tolerate"" that citizens take the law ""in their own hands"". The journalism student was brutally killed by fellow students on campus. Eight have now been charged with murder and terrorism, officials say. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive and incendiary issue in Pakistan. Critics say blasphemy laws, which allow the death penalty in some cases, are often misused to oppress minorities. The murdered student has been identified as Mashal Khan, who was accused of posting blasphemous messages on social media. Local media report he was stripped and beaten in the hostel at Abdul Wali Khan University in the northern city of Mardan. Graphic video posted online showed dozens of men outside the building kicking and throwing objects, including planks, at a half-naked body sprawled on the ground. Mr Sharif, who has supported a wide-ranging crackdown on blasphemous content on social media, condemned the attack, in his first statement on Thursday's killing. ""The nation should stand united to condemn this crime and to promote tolerance and rule of law in society,"" he said. ""Let it be known to the perpetrators of this act that the state shall not tolerate citizens taking the law in their own hands."" The police have denied allegations that officers did not act to save Mr Khan's life, saying that the student was already dead when they arrived at the scene. They have arrested 12 people over the incident and are hunting for more suspects. Human rights activists held small protests in several Pakistani cities on Saturday condemning the murder, and the UN in Pakistan urged authorities ""to take firm action and bring the perpetrators to speedy justice"". Witnesses told media that Mr Khan was disliked by other students for his liberal and secular views, and had been in a heated debate during a class the day he was killed. The imam at the local mosque refused to lead the prayer at Mr Khan's funeral on Friday. But the student's father said the accusations of blasphemy were unfounded. ""First they killed my son and now they are adding salt to our wounds,"" Iqbal Shaer told Reuters news agency. At least 65 people have been murdered in Pakistan after being accused of blasphemy since 1990, a recent think tank report said.",Sunday 16 April 2017,16-Apr-17,Pakistan PM shock over blasphemy killing,Condemnation follows the brutal death of a student at the hands of a campus mob.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39610175
"MOAB strike: 90 IS fighters killed in Afghanistan At least 90 militants from the Islamic State (IS) group were killed by a huge bomb dropped by the US in Afghanistan, a regional governor says. The most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in combat was dropped on an IS base in Nangarhar province. A network of tunnels and caves was destroyed on Thursday evening local time, US officials said. The death toll was confirmed to the BBC by Ismail Shinwary, the governor of Achin province within Nangarhar. IS had earlier said it had not suffered any casualties in the blast. No civilians were killed in the explosion, Mr Shinwary said. The Chief Executive of Afghanistan, Abdullah Abdullah, said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with his government and ""great care had been taken to avoid civilian harm"".  However, one resident close to where the blast happened told the BBC some homes were destroyed. The explosion lit up the whole night sky, he said. Known as the ""mother of all bombs"", or MOAB, the device was dropped on Thursday evening by an MC-130 transport plane, falling in Nangarhar's Achin district. It was the first time the bomb, one of only 15 ever built, had been used in combat. When IS announced the establishment of its Khorasan branch - an old name for Afghanistan and surrounding areas - in January 2015, it was the first time the group had officially spread outside the Arab world. ""The enemy had created bunkers, tunnels and extensive mine fields, and this weapon was used to reduce those obstacles so that we could continue our offensive in southern Nangarhar,"" said Gen John Nicholson, the most senior US military commander in Afghanistan. While the attack was supported by the Afghan government, former president Hamid Karzai said it represented an ""inhuman and most brutal misuse of our country as testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"". Mr Shinwary had earlier confirmed to the BBC that Afghan special forces, with the help of American air support, had begun anti-IS operations in the area two weeks ago. But reports say fighting has intensified in recent days. Last Saturday, an American special forces soldier was killed fighting militants.",Sunday 16 April 2017,16-Apr-17,IS death toll from Afghan bomb reaches 90,The fighters were killed in the most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in combat.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39607213
"Dana Vollmer, the Olympic swimmer racing while six months pregnant With a little more than 1,000 days to go until the 2020 Tokyo Olympics begin, preparation - even at this stage - is key. Such is the case with American swimmer Dana Vollmer, who claimed her seventh Olympic medal in Rio last year. But she has had to adapt her preparation for Tokyo to cater for, in her words, the ""bowling ball"" in her stomach. In her first race since Rio on Thursday, Vollmer was six months pregnant. The first obstacle was finding a swimming costume that worked for her - up from the size 26 she wore in Rio to a size 32 at Thursday's race in Mesa, Arizona. ""It kind of holds everything in,"" she said, in an interview on the Team USA website. ""We had to go up a few sizes to hold the belly."" Vollmer raced with her doctor's permission, and has amended her training programme while pregnant by doing more strength training. In an interview before the race with ESPN, she said training was a welcome distraction. ""As hard as people think this is, the race is only 30 seconds long as opposed to the entire day I spend holding and chasing around a 35-pound two-year-old,"" she said. ""This will feel like a break."" After winning gold in the 100m butterfly in the 2012 London Olympics, Vollmer took time off to have her first child, son Arlen, and returned in time to qualify for Rio. But this time around, she has made the decision to continue training. Baby number two, a boy, is due in July. ""Putting the health of the baby first doesn't just mean sitting on the couch,"" the 29-year-old said. Why it's OK to run when you are pregnant Vollmer isn't the first woman to race while heavily pregnant - in June 2014, Alysia Montano competed in the 800m quarter finals of the US track and field championships while eight months pregnant. Plenty of women have also taken part in the Olympics while pregnant, though none did in Rio, due to concerns over the effect of the Zika virus on unborn children. The website of the US Swimming Masters, an organisation helping promote the sport, advises that women can carry on swimming even while heavily pregnant, but that each case is different. Competing in the 50 metres freestyle only three months before giving birth did present one particular challenge for Vollmer.

"Turkey referendum grants President Erdogan sweeping new powers Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has narrowly won a referendum to expand presidential powers, which could keep him in office until 2029. With 99.45% of ballots counted, the ""Yes"" campaign had won 51.37% and ""No"" 48.63%, and the electoral board called victory for ""Yes"". Erdogan supporters say replacing the parliamentary system with an executive presidency will modernise the country.  Turkey's two main opposition parties said they would challenge the results. The Republican People's Party (CHP) demanded a recount of 60% of votes. They criticised a decision to accept unstamped ballot papers as valid unless proven otherwise. As jubilant Erdogan supporters rallied in the big cities, pots and pans were banged in Istanbul by opponents of the referendum, in a traditional form of protest.    Three people were shot dead near a polling station in the south-eastern province of Diyarbakir, reportedly during a dispute over how they were voting.  The European Commission called on the Turkish authorities in a statement to ""seek the broadest possible national consensus"" when implementing the constitutional reforms.  They are rejoicing into the night here outside the headquarters of the governing AK party (AKP), confident in the victory claimed by President Erdogan. He and his government say more than 51% of voters have backed the constitutional reform but the opposition has cried foul, claiming massive irregularities over invalid votes and vowing to challenge the result at the supreme electoral board.  Mr Erdogan said the clear victory needed to be respected. In a typically rabble-rousing speech, he proposed another referendum on reinstating the death penalty, which would end Turkey's EU negotiations.  But this has not been the resounding win he wanted and doubts will linger over its legitimacy. It was hoped this vote might bring Turkey stability but that still seems some way off. ""Today... Turkey has taken a historic decision,"" Mr Erdogan told a briefing at his official Istanbul residence, the Huber Palace. ""With the people, we have realised the most important reform in our history."" He called on everyone to respect the outcome of the vote. The president also said the country could hold a referendum on bringing back the death penalty. He usually gives triumphant balcony speeches, the BBC's Mark Lowen notes, but this was a muted indoors address. Deputy Prime Minister Veysi Kaynak admitted the ""Yes"" vote had been lower than expected. The draft states that the next presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on 3 November 2019.  The president will have a five-year tenure, for a maximum of two terms. Mr Erdogan says the changes are needed to address Turkey's security challenges nine months after an attempted coup, and to avoid the fragile coalition governments of the past. The new system, he argues, will resemble those in France and the US and will bring calm in a time of turmoil marked by a Kurdish insurgency, Islamist militancy and conflict in neighbouring Syria, which has led to a huge refugee influx. Critics of the changes fear the move will make the president's position too powerful, arguing that it amounts to one-man rule, without the checks and balances of other presidential systems such as those in France and the US. They say his ability to retain ties to a political party - Mr Erdogan could resume leadership of the AKP he co-founded - will end any chance of impartiality. CHP deputy leader Erdal Aksunger said he believed there had been irregularities in the count: ""Many illegal acts are being carried out in favour of the 'Yes' campaign right now.  ""There is the state on one side and people on the other. 'No' will win in the end. Everybody will see that."" The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) also challenged the vote. Critics abroad fear Erdogan's reach The day a Turkish writer's life changed Many Turks already fear growing authoritarianism in their country, where tens of thousands of people have been arrested, and at least 100,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs, since a coup attempt last July.  The campaign unfolded under a state of emergency imposed in the wake of the failed coup. Mr Erdogan assumed the presidency, meant to be a largely ceremonial position, in 2014 after more than a decade as prime minister. Under his rule, the middle class has ballooned and infrastructure has been modernised, while religious Turks have been empowered. Relations with the EU, meanwhile, have deteriorated. Mr Erdogan sparred bitterly with European governments who banned rallies by his ministers in their countries during the referendum campaign. He called the bans ""Nazi acts"".

"Turkey referendum: Key reactions Turkey is divided between those who are celebrating a win in a national referendum, and those demanding a recount.  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has claimed victory in the vote, which looks set to grant him sweeping new powers.  But international observers have highlighted an ""unlevel playing field"" and critics have warned it closes the door on Turkey's faltering bid to join the European Union. President Erdogan said in his victory speech that Turks had voted for ""not just an ordinary or simple change"". ""This is the first time in Turkish history that the Turkish people have cast their votes on such an important constitutional change. ""In the past it was the parliament who actually decided whether to make any constitutional changes but today, for the first time, the will of the people has shown through this referendum and this is the first time in our history and very important."" He also said voters abroad were a big part of the success. ""We would like other countries and institutions to show respect to the decision of the nation,"" he added. The main opposition, the Republican People's Party (CHP), called for a recount, its deputy leader Bulent Tezcan denouncing ""violations"" in the electoral process involving one-and-a-half million unstamped ballot papers. The party produced footage apparently showing election officials stamping ballot papers after counting began. ""We will pursue a legal battle. If the irregularities are not fixed, there will be a serious legitimacy discussion,"" said Mr Tezcan. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which has had two of its leaders imprisoned under President Erdogan, said the result would not be legitimate until an appeal was finalised.  ""Our co-chairs being jailed, the referendum being held under a state of emergency, and other oppressive measures cast a shadow and legitimacy problem over the vote,"" HDP spokesman Osman Baydemir told reporters. Exiled Erdogan critic Can Dundar, ex-editor in chief of Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper, told Germany's Die Welt that this would be a Pyrrhic victory that marked ""the beginning of the end of the Erdogan era"".  Even with a media that had almost exclusively backed a Yes vote the majority was still so tiny, he said. The opposition Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) had internal fights over the referendum and expelled a rebel member, Meral Aksener, who became a leading ""No"" campaigner.  Leader Devlet Bahceli, who led the party's push for ""Yes"", said the result was an ""undeniably successful achievement"" and should be respected, according to Reuters news agency.  Ms Aksener is disputing the result.  Some of the most damning criticism came from the small team of international monitors, which complained of an ""unlevel playing field"".  ""In general, the referendum did not live up to Council of Europe standards,"" said Cezar Florin Preda, head of the Council's Parliamentary Assembly delegation. Among the objections:  While the margin of victory within Turkey was small, a far larger 59% of Turks voting abroad supported boosting the president's powers.  In Germany, which has the EU's biggest Turkish community, 63% voted Yes. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a joint statement with Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, warned that the ""tight referendum result shows how deeply divided Turkish society is and that means a big responsibility for the Turkish leadership and for President Erdogan personally"". Elmar Brok, the German head of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee, said the result did not legitimise a complete overhaul of the state. And the president of Germany's Turkish community, Gokay Sofuoglu, said parties and organisations within Germany had to ""find ways of better reaching people who live in freedom in Germany and yet want autocracy for people in Turkey"". The US President Donald Trump called Mr Erdogan ""to congratulate him on the success of the referendum"", the state-run news agency Anadolu reported citing unnamed sources. Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said the result was a ""clear signal against the European Union"". The ""fiction"" of Turkey's bid to join the bloc must be ended, he said. Julia Klöckner, a leading voice in Angela Merkel's German CDU party said the door to EU accession was ""well and truly shut"" and called for billions of euros in contributions to finance Turkey's bid to stop. The European Commission urged Turkey to seek ""the broadest possible consensus"" in implementing changes. It pointed to ""alleged irregularities"" in the vote and said it was awaiting the assessment of international observers. In claiming victory, President Erdogan said he would review Turkey's suspension of the death penalty. That would not only bring an end to Turkey's faltering bid to join the EU but bring it into conflict with the Council of Europe's aim of abolishing capital punishment. The French president's office warned that any referendum on reviving the death penalty would ""obviously be a break with values and engagements"" that Turkey had accepted in joining the Council of Europe. The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, tweeted his own concerns. The pan-European human rights body of which Turkey is a member said it was ""of utmost importance to secure the independence of the judiciary in line with the principle of rule of law enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights"".

"Facebook murder suspect Steve Stephens hunted across US A nationwide manhunt is under way in the US for the suspect who shot dead a grandfather on the street apparently at random and posted the footage. The suspect, Steve Stephens, said in another video post that he had killed 13 people and would kill more. He shot dead 74-year-old Robert Godwin in Ohio as the victim walked home from Easter lunch on Sunday afternoon.  Facebook has launched a review of its procedures after criticism that the footage stayed on the site for hours. Justin Osofsky, Facebook’s vice-president of global operations, said the first complaint made about the video showing the killing came nearly two hours after it was posted. But he added: “We know we need to do better.”  A 'monster' who 'just snapped' Facebook to review violent content policies Police have asked residents of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania to be on the alert, saying suspect could be anywhere. Cleveland police department have issued a photo of Mr Stephens, 37, on its website, describing him as a black male, 6ft 1in (1.86m) and 244lb (110kg).  Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters on Monday that Mr Stephens, who has a licence to carry a concealed firearm, is armed ""without a doubt"".  Cleveland officials have also offered a $50,000 (£39,805) reward for information that leads to his location.  His mobile phone signal was last tracked on Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania. Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said in a press conference on Monday morning: ""Steve is still out there some place… we're still asking Steve to turn himself in, but if he doesn't we'll find him."" FBI Special Agent Stephen Anthony said: ""Quite frankly, he could be in a lot of places."" US Marshall Peter Elliot said law enforcement agencies across the US were helping create a dragnet to ""make this individual's world very, very, very small"". Investigators said Mr Stephens' boast about other killings was still not verified.   Police say the victim in Sunday's graphic video appeared to have been selected at random.  The suspect approaches Mr Godwin and asks him to say the name of a woman believed to be the gunman's former girlfriend, before shooting him in the head. ""Can you do me a favour?"" asks the gunman. ""Can you say Joy Lane?"" The victim says: ""Joy Lane."" Mr Stephen says: ""Yeah, she's the reason why all this about to happen to you. How old are you?"" The grandfather and father of nine appears to try to shield himself by holding up a plastic bag. The woman, Joy Lane, confirmed to CBS News that she and Mr Stephen had been in a ""relationship for several years"". ""I am sorry that all of this has happened. My heart & prayers goes out to the family members of the victim(s). Steve really is a nice guy... he is generous with everyone he knows.  ""He was kind and loving to me and my children,"" she wrote in a text message.  Maggie Green, the suspect's mother, told CNN that he was ""mad with his girlfriend. That's why he is shooting people and he won't stop until his mother or girlfriend tell him to stop.""

"United Airlines changes policy after 'horrific' passenger ordeal United Airlines is changing its policy on giving staff last-minute seats on full flights after a man was dragged screaming from a fully  booked plane. The airline said that in future crew members would be allocated seats at least an hour before departure. It comes after passenger Dr David Dao lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose when he was forcibly removed from a flight last Sunday. United Airlines said the move was aimed at improving its customer services.  The incident involving Dr Dao caused outrage and widespread condemnation of the airline after shocking footage was shared and watched by millions of people online.  His daughter, Crystal Dao Pepper, later told a news conference in Chicago that the family had been ""sickened"" by what had happened. Law enforcement officials dragged Dr Dao off a flight departing from Chicago for Louisville, Kentucky, because it was fully booked, and the airline wanted four passengers to make way for staff members. The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician had refused to leave, saying he needed to go home to see his patients. He was then dragged down the aisle of the aircraft.  His lawyer later said that Dr Dao found the experience ""more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam"". The ordeal led to demonstrations at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and turned into a public relations disaster for United Airlines.  The situation escalated when a response from the airline's chief executive, Oscar Munoz, failed to mention any use of excessive force. ""This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologise for having to re-accommodate these customers,"" he said in a statement. He also said that Dr Dao was ""disruptive and belligerent"". Days later Mr Munoz, who was facing calls to resign from online petitions that had received thousands of signatures, said he felt ""shame and embarrassment"" and vowed that it would never happen again.

"Prince Harry 'in total chaos' over mother Diana's death Prince Harry has revealed he sought counselling after spending nearly 20 years ""not thinking"" about the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said it was not until his late 20s that he processed the grief - after two years of ""total chaos"" and coming close to a ""complete breakdown"". But he was in a ""good place"" because of the ""process I have been through"". Harry, 32, also said boxing had ""saved"" him by helping him let out aggression. The Telegraph says Prince Harry had decided to talk about his past in the hope it would encourage people to break the stigma surrounding mental health issues. Along with his brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he is promoting the Heads Together mental health campaign, the London Marathon's charity of the year. Speaking to the paper's Bryony Gordon, Prince Harry said: ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well."" He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is a senior royal as we rarely see or hear them.   Prince Harry is part of the future of an institution that once embodied the British stiff-upper-lip approach to life.   Such an approach was dealt a blow by Diana, Princess of Wales.  In her 1995 BBC Panorama interview, she told Martin Bashir about her post-natal depression, her self-harming and her bulimia.   Now, Prince Harry is following his mother's example. In the podcast, which is a compelling listen, Harry admits to feeling nervous as he speaks openly about suffering from anxiety, coming close to a breakdown and being a ""problem"" for much of his 20s.  Prince Harry is this country's most high profile person yet to talk about his personal mental anguish.    His privileged life in a palace hasn't protected him from ill-health.   Diana's son hopes that his up-front display of honesty will help to break the taboo that still surrounds mental health.  Read more from Peter The Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. Prince Harry said: ""My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?"" ""(I thought) it's only going to make you sad, it's not going to bring her back. So from an emotional side, I was like 'right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything.'"" He described himself as a ""typical 20, 25, 28-year-old running around going 'life is great', or 'life is fine' and that was exactly it. ""And then [I] started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with."" He said he decided to act after his brother - the Duke of Cambridge - told him: ""Look, you really need to deal with this. It is not normal to think that nothing has affected you."" Prince Harry opened up to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon over a cup of tea at Kensington Palace during a half-hour interview recorded for a podcast on mental health issues. Gordon, who has previously spoken of her own struggles with bulimia, alcoholism and an obsessive compulsive disorder, said the pair had been alone in the room. She said it had been unusual to hear a royal talk for half an hour on any subject and described Prince Harry as ""really articulate and a sound guy"". Prince Harry said: ""Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever - the Americans call them shrinks - someone you have never met before.  ""You sit down on the sofa and say 'listen, I don't actually need your advice. Can you just listen'. And you just let it all rip."" Asked whether he had counselling, he said: ""I've done that a couple of times, more than a couple of times, but it's great."" But he said he could ""safely say"" his concerns were not related to his service as a soldier in Afghanistan. On taking up boxing, Prince Harry told the paper: ""Everyone was saying boxing is good for you and it's a really good way of letting out aggression. ""And that really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone."" Prince Harry said: ""Because of the process I have been through over the past two-and-a-half years, I've now been able to take my work seriously, been able to take my private life seriously as well, and been able to put blood, sweat and tears into the things that really make a difference and things that I think will make a difference to everybody else.""

"North Korea nuclear: US 'working with China' on response The US and China are working on a ""range of options"" on North Korea, the US top security adviser has said, as tensions mount over the country's nuclear and missile programmes. Lt Gen HR McMaster told ABC News there was consensus with China that this was a situation that ""could not continue"". The comments come after a failed missile test launch by North Korea and a massive military parade. President Trump had earlier said China was ""working with us"" on the issue. Beijing, Pyongyang's biggest ally, has come under pressure from Washington to exert more pressure on its neighbour. Sunday's comments appear to be the first confirmation that both countries are working together on how to deal with the North Korean issue.  Gen McMaster, who was in the Afghan capital, Kabul, said the latest launch ""fits a pattern of provocative and destabilising and threatening behaviour"". ""The president has made clear that he will not accept the United States and its allies and partners in the region being under threat from this hostile regime with nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""I think there's an international consensus now, including the Chinese and the Chinese leadership, that this is a situation that just can't continue."" President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed North Korea during a meeting last week. Mr Xi offered co-operation on ""communication and co-ordination"", the BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai reports. Earlier on Sunday, South Korean and US military officials said a North Korean missile had detonated soon after launch. The US Pacific Command said it believed it to be a ballistic missile. Investigations were continuing, but one unnamed US official said it was unlikely to have been an intercontinental (ICBM) missile. Ballistic missiles follow high trajectories and are initially powered and guided, but fall to their target under gravity. ICBMs follow a sub-orbital trajectory, others stay within the atmosphere. North Korea's aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an ICBM that can reach targets around the world. Pyongyang has claimed to have miniaturised nuclear warheads for use on missiles, though experts have cast doubt on that given the lack of evidence. The state has already conducted five nuclear tests and a series of missile launches in contravention of UN resolutions. It has suffered test failures in the past but they have not deterred its development programme. Meanwhile, US Vice-President Mike Pence is on a 10-day tour of Asia intended to reassure allies of US commitment to their security. In the South Korean capital, Seoul, Mr Pence called the failed launch a ""provocation"". He is set to discuss North Korea with acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson meanwhile issued another warning to North Korea after its failed missile launch. ""They must stop these belligerent acts and comply with UN resolutions,"" he said. On Friday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that the situation in the region was escalating, and that ""conflict could break out at any moment"".

"Bastia v Lyon abandoned amid crowd trouble as fans try to attack players   A match between French Ligue 1 sides Bastia and Lyon was abandoned after home fans invaded the pitch in Corsica. Kick-off was delayed by 55 minutes, as Bastia fans tried to attack visiting Lyon players during their warm-up. Stewards held off fans while players were rushed down the tunnel and a gate closed behind them. Lyon were then persuaded to start the match - having initially refused - before further incident caused the abandonment at half-time. The Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which governs France's professional leagues, will meet on Thursday to decide what action to take. It called on Bastia to issue stadium bans to the fans responsible, adding: ""The LFP condemns with the greatest firmness the incidents which took place before the game and at half-time of the Bastia-Lyon game."" Trouble began before the match as Lyon's players, including former Manchester United forward Memphis Depay, came out on the pitch to warm up. Their goalkeeper Mathieu Gorgelin found himself caught in the middle of a group of pitch invaders before the players were directed back to the dressing room. Lyon defender Jeremy Berthod said: ""Bastia fans kicked balls into Gorgelin's goal. He and Memphis tried to move them out of the way before being attacked by many SC Bastia fans. ""The players then huddled together. They and the staff are very shocked. The moment it happened, none of them wanted to come out of the dressing room and play this match."" It has been a difficult week for Lyon, with crowd trouble before their Europa League game with Besiktas on Thursday. Fans clashed before their quarter-final first leg in France, with kick-off delayed by 45 minutes as a result. Lyon went on to win 2-1. Lyon face four Uefa charges from that game, for the setting-off of fireworks, blocking stairways, insufficient organisation and a pitch invasion after a late winning goal.

"Syria war: 'At least 68 children among 126 killed' in bus bombing At least 68 children were among 126 people killed in Saturday's bomb attack on buses carrying evacuees from besieged Syrian towns, activists say. A vehicle filled with explosives hit the convoy near Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said at least 109 evacuees from government-held towns were killed, along with aid workers and rebel soldiers. Many more were injured in the attack, the group said.  The explosion shattered buses and set cars on fire, leaving a trail of bodies, as the convoy waited in rebel territory near Aleppo.  Separately, several people, mostly children, are reported to have been injured by shelling in the capital, Damascus. At least three shells landed near the central Umayyad Square, state and pro-government media outlets reported. State TV blamed ""terrorists"". The evacuees attacked on Saturday were being moved from Foah and Kefraya, mostly Shia Muslim government-held towns which have been encircled by rebels and al-Qaeda-linked Sunni jihadists since March 2015. No group has claimed responsibility for the bus attack. In his Easter Sunday address, Pope Francis called the bombing a ""vile attack on fleeing refugees"". ""May [God] sustain the efforts of those who are actively working to bring comfort and relief to the civilian population in beloved Syria, who are greatly suffering from a war that does not cease to sow horror and death,"" he said. The bomb went off at Rashidin, west of government-held Aleppo, at about 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) at the checkpoint where the handover of evacuees was due to take place. It happened when a vehicle loaded with food arrived and started distributing crisps, attracting many children, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Lina Sinjab said. Another vehicle then exploded.  She said it was not clear how the vehicle could have reached the area without government permission. But there is also no evidence that rebels were involved in the attack, as the government claims. It would not be in the rebels' interest, our correspondent says, as they were waiting for their own supporters to be evacuated from the other towns. The planned evacuation was part of the so-called ""four towns"" deal, where thousands of civilians in towns under siege by both sides would be allowed to leave. It applies to Foah and Kefraya, as well as rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus.  There were fears of revenge attacks on evacuees from rebel-held towns, being moved under a deal. But the exchange later resumed, with coaches reaching safety on both sides. Evacuations were due to continue on Sunday. Rebels had earlier accused the government of breaching the terms of the deal, accusing it of trying to bring out more loyalist fighters than agreed, along with civilians. Madaya and Zabadani, which are predominantly Sunni Muslim, have been besieged since June 2015 by the Syrian army and fighters from Lebanon's Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement. A previous attempt at mutual evacuations failed in December when rebels burnt coaches due to be sent to the towns.",Monday 17 April 2017,17-Apr-17,Syria blast 'killed at least 68 children',The explosion targeted buses carrying evacuees from besieged Syrian towns on Saturday.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39613313
"Drones flying into prisons to be examined by new police team The Prison Service and police are to pool intelligence to stop drones flying drugs and mobile phones to prison inmates in England and Wales. They will forensically examine captured drones to try to find out who was flying them. The invention of easy-to-fly, remote-controlled aircraft has caused a huge security headache for prisons. But critics have called the plan a ""red herring"" to distract people from ""chaos and crisis"" in prisons.  The national initiative will see police and prison officers share information about the quadcopters and methods used. Prisons Minister Sam Gyimah said: ""We are absolutely determined to tackle the illegal flow of drugs and mobile phones into our prisons and turn them into places of safety and reform. ""The threat posed by drones is clear but our dedicated staff are committed to winning the fight against those who are attempting to thwart progress by wreaking havoc in establishments all over the country. ""My message to those who involve themselves in this type of criminal activity is clear: we will find you and put you behind bars."" The Prison Service could not give details about how many officers would be involved, but reports suggested £3m would be spent on the new task force. John Podmore, former head of the service's anti-corruption unit, said whilst there was an issue with contraband in prisons, targeting this money at drones was a ""PR stunt"".  ""I have seen no evidence that there is a real problem with drones,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think the number of incidents last year was 33.  ""There are some 10,000 mobile phones found every year in prisons. My question to the Prison Service would be, how many of those were found hanging from drones?"" Instead, Mr Podmore thought the service should be looking the wider issue of contraband smuggling, including the ""main route [of] staff corruption"". Mike Rolfe, national chair of the Prison Officers Association, said prisoners had told him that they had seen two or three drones a night delivering packages over the walls. However, he said he agreed with Mr Podmore that the initiative was an attempt to distract people from ""the real issue [of] jails in complete chaos, in a crisis and flooded with drugs, mobile phones and weapons"". BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford says prison walls are now not much of a barrier for those wanting to smuggle contraband into jails. There have been some recent successes in finding and punishing those who are behind the drone flights, says the Ministry of Justice. In December, Dean Rawley-Bell, 21, was jailed for four years and eight months after he used a drone in attempts to smuggle drugs and mobile phones into Manchester Prison. Renelle Carlisle, 23, was sentenced to three years and four months in October after he was caught outside Risley Prison in Warrington with a drone in his bag, trying to smuggle drugs inside. In July, 37-year-old Daniel Kelly was jailed for 14 months for trying to supply contraband to offenders in Elmley and Swaleside Prison in Sheppey, Wandsworth Prison in London and the Mount Prison in Hemel Hempstead.

"Migrant boats: Thousands saved off Libyan coast over Easter Thousands of migrants have been saved from the sea near Libya during one of the busiest weekends of the year for rescue workers. More than 2,000 people were rescued on Friday and 3,000 on Saturday in dozens of separate rescues, the Italian Coast Guard said. But at least seven people drowned as aid workers struggled to rescue more than 1,500 migrants in one operation. An eight-year-old boy was among the dead, rescue workers said. An earlier agency report said 20 bodies had been recovered by the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (Moas), but this was later corrected. Moas said its rescue started in the early hours of Saturday and had continued non-stop into Sunday afternoon. The group said it had rescued at least 453 people, but more than 1,000 remained in danger. Chris Catrambone, one of the founders of Moas, said it had requested ""urgent assistance"" on Saturday morning. ""Our crew says they've never seen anything like it,"" the organisation tweeted.  Italian NGO Sea Eye and the German group Jugend Rettet were also aiding the rescue attempt. Doctors without Borders (MSF) said its rescue boats Prudence and Aquarius had rescued about 1,000 people during Friday's operations, during which one migrant is believed to have died. The improving Spring weather may have factored into the sudden surge of ocean crossings. The Libyan coastline remains a hotspot for such rescues, as unscrupulous smugglers crowd wooden boats or inflatable dinghies with hundreds of desperate migrants. At least 97 migrants died the previous Thursday, when their boat sank. Just 23 men were rescued, clinging to a flotation device. In late February, the bodies of 87 people washed ashore in a Libyan city. Although the Mediterranean migrant crisis has subsided from its 2015 peak, the Libyan trafficking situation prompted EU leaders to agree a plan of action. They gave €200m (£170m) to Libya's UN-backed government to reinforce its coastguard and disrupt the people-smuggling networks. But that government has limited control over the largely lawless strife-torn nation, and human rights groups argue that turning refugees away and forcing them back to the dangers of Libya is unacceptable. The United Nations estimates that 32,750 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, despite the dangerous winter weather. An estimated 826 are dead, or missing. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

"Sebastian Vettel beats Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain thriller By Andrew Benson Chief F1 writer in Bahrain  Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel won a hectic and thrilling Bahrain Grand Prix as Lewis Hamilton's hopes were hit by a penalty for gamesmanship. Mercedes' Hamilton was penalised five seconds for driving slowly on pit entry to hold up Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Serving it at his second and final pit stop, Hamilton rejoined in third place. Team-mate Valtteri Bottas was ordered to let Hamilton by so he could chase Vettel, but 12 seconds in nine laps was too big a task and he took second. Vettel's win gives him a seven-point lead over Hamilton in the championship. It was not completely clear who had the quickest car - Ferrari argued it was them; Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said Hamilton was the fastest. And the world champions may well feel this was a race that got away from them. But the best race of the season, in which all three so far have been good, underlined one key fact - Ferrari are absolutely competitive and they and Mercedes are in a titanic struggle for the championship. Hamilton and Vettel look like the men who will fight it - Bottas is not yet on Hamilton's level and Kimi Raikkonen was again relatively anonymous, a poor start leaving him a long way behind but recovering to take fourth place ahead of Ricciardo. Red Bull's Max Verstappen may well have been in the fight, too, but crashed out after 11 laps with brake failure. It turned on two key moments - an aggressive early pit stop by Ferrari for Vettel; and Hamilton's decision to slow on the way into the pits when the safety car was sent out following a collision between Williams driver Lance Stroll and Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz. But other issues played a part, too - Hamilton should probably have taken pole but made a mistake at Turn 10 on his final qualifying lap, allowing Bottas to do so for the first time in his career. And Mercedes, in a very difficult position in only the third race of the year, waited until just short of half-distance to order the slower Bottas to let Hamilton by for the first time. The combination of those two things left Hamilton with too much to do on a frustrating afternoon on which he and Mercedes were arguably the fastest combination but victory slipped through their fingers. Hamilton's decision to slow in front of Ricciardo on the way into the pits on lap 13 was made because he was behind Bottas, who was also coming in, and he wanted to give himself time to have his tyres changed straight after his team-mate and not lose a place to the Australian.  He apologised to the team afterwards for his actions, which he said might have cost him victory. A slow pit stop for Bottas made matters even worse for Mercedes. Ferrari's aggressive strategy was triggered when Bottas converted his first career pole, in his third race for Mercedes, into a first-lap lead but did not have the pace to get away from his pursuers. Team boss Wolff said Bottas had too-high tyre pressures as a result of a problem on the grid. The Finn found himself leading a five-car train, comprised of Vettel, Hamilton and the Red Bulls of Verstappen and Ricciardo. Unable to pass, but clearly being held up, Ferrari chose a very early first pit stop for Vettel on lap 10, switching onto a second set of the super-soft tyres. Verstappen followed him in a lap later but suffered brake failure at the last corner immediately afterwards. Hamilton closed in on Bottas, only for the safety car to be introduced on lap 13 after the crash at the first corner. All the remaining front runners pitted - Hamilton earning his penalty - and Bottas fitted the super-softs and Hamilton the more durable softs. At the re-start four laps later, Vettel led Bottas and Hamilton and the Ferrari started to pull away, and as he built a lead of more than four seconds by lap 25, Mercedes finally ordered Bottas to let Hamilton through into second place. Hamilton closed his deficit to Vettel from 6.3 seconds on lap 27 to 4.3 on 32, and the Ferrari pitted for the final time a lap later, rejoining 17 seconds behind on soft tyres Hamilton but immediately setting fastest laps. Hamilton served his penalty at his final pit stop on lap 41, fitting another set of soft tyres and rejoining 18 seconds behind the leader, and now it was the Englishman's turn to set fastest laps. Bottas moved out of the way into Turn 13 on lap 47, leaving Hamilton with 12 seconds to close in 10 laps. It was too much. A gripping race was enlivened by battles throughout the field, one of the most intense of which was between Renault's Jolyon Palmer, Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat and McLaren's Fernando Alonso. They swapped positions for many laps, racing furiously, but Alonso's frustration at battling with his down-on-power Honda engine grew throughout. He said he had ""never raced with less power in my life"" and later, after losing out to Kvyat but finally moving clear of Palmer, he found Esteban Ocon's Mercedes-powered Force India coming up behind him and blasting past on the straight. ""He was, what, 300 metres behind us on the straight?"" Alonso said to his engineer Mark Temple. ""We're considering Plan B,"" Temple said. ""How are the tyres?"" Alonso replied: ""Do what you want, man."" Alonso eventually retired with an engine problem, the latest in a series for Honda in a weekend in which they have lost four MGU-Hs, one of them on team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne's car before the race even started.

"James Bond actor Clifton James dies at 96 Actor Clifton James, who appeared as Sheriff JW Pepper in two James Bond films, has died at the age of 96. He died close to his childhood home in Gladstone, Oregon, on Saturday due to complications from diabetes. James was best known for appearing alongside Sir Roger Moore in the Bond films Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun during the 1970s. His daughter Lynn said: ""He was the most outgoing person, beloved by everybody."" She added: ""I don't think the man had an enemy. We were incredibly blessed to have had him in our lives."" In 1973 James played Louisiana sheriff JW Pepper in Live and Let Die, in which he made a memorable appearance in a chaotic boat chase sequence. His character proved so popular he was asked to reprise the role in 1974's The Man with the Golden Gun, involving another car chase, in Thailand, and a scene where he gets pushed into water by a baby elephant. Paying tribute on Twitter, Sir Roger wrote: ""Terribly sad to hear Clifton James has left us. As JW Pepper he gave my first two Bond films a great, fun character."" While many James Bond characters either feature once or have recurring roles in the series, Sherriff Pepper is among a select few characters to have featured in just two different titles. Here are four others:  Sylvia Trench: A love interest of Bond played by Eunice Gayson. She appeared alongside Sir Sean Connery in the 1962 film Dr No, as well as 1963's From Russia with Love. Jaws: One of Bond's most famous villains, Jaws was played by the late Richard Kiel. The character appeared with Sir Roger Moore in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me and later in 1979's Moonraker. Valentin Zukovsky: An ex-KGB agent turned Russian mafia head who was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane. He featured with Pierce Brosnan in the 1995 film GoldenEye and 1999's The World is Not Enough. Rene Mathis: A French intelligence operative played by Giancarlo Giannini. He appeared alongside Daniel Craig in the 2006 film Casino Royale and 2008's Quantum of Solace. James grew up just outside Portland during the heart of the Great Depression, in which his family lost all their money. He served as a soldier with the US Army in the South Pacific during World War Two, for which he was awarded two Purple Hearts, a Silver Star and a Bronze star. His acting career spanned five decades and included stints on stage, TV and film. Other credits include appearing in the TV series Dallas and films Superman II and The Bonfire of the Vanities. His last film credit was a 2006 comedy, Raising Flagg but he had also been cast to star in an upcoming independent film called Old Soldiers, according to IMDB.",Monday 17 April 2017,17-Apr-17,James Bond actor Clifton James dies at 96,He appeared alongside Roger Moore as Sherriff JW Pepper in two Bond films during the 1970s.,http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39615966
"North Korea 'will test missiles weekly', senior official tells BBC North Korea will continue to test missiles, a senior official has told the BBC in Pyongyang, despite international condemnation and growing military tensions with the US. ""We'll be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis,"" Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the BBC's John Sudworth. He said that an ""all-out war"" would result if the US took military action. Earlier, US Vice-President Mike Pence warned North Korea not to test the US. He said his country's ""era of strategic patience"" with North Korea was over. Mr Pence arrived in Seoul on Sunday hours after Pyongyang carried out a failed missile launch. On Tuesday, while visiting Tokyo, he called the North Korea regime ""the most ominous threat"" to the region. He reiterated that while the US and allies would exert economic pressure, ""all options are on the table"" in dealing with Pyongyang. Tensions have been escalating on the peninsula, with heated rhetoric from both North Korea and the US. Mr Han told the BBC: ""If the US is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method."" North Korea has accelerated its nuclear and missile tests in recent years, despite international condemnation and UN sanctions. Its aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach targets around the world, including the US. US President Donald Trump has said that will not happen, and stepped up pressure on the isolated North.  He has sent a navy strike group towards the Korean Peninsula, and the US and South Korea are moving ahead with the early deployment of a controversial missile defence system. Despite the tension, North Korea may carry out a sixth nuclear test soon, observers say. It test-fired a missile on Sunday that exploded within seconds of launch, following a grand military parade on Saturday. Speaking alongside South Korea's acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn on Monday, Mr Pence said North Korea should not test US President Donald Trump. ""Just in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan,"" Mr Pence said. ""North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region."" He reiterated US support for South Korea, telling his host: ""We are with you 100%."" Last month, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned that pre-emptive military action was ""on the table"". But the US is also working with China, North Korea's main ally, to pressure the regime to stop nuclear and missile tests. Mr Pence told journalists that the White House hoped China would use its ""extraordinary levers"" to pressure North Korea, the Associated Press reports. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul says US policy now seems to be to persuade China to contain North Korea while keeping the economic and military pressure on. Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the BBC that North Korea believed its nuclear weapons ""protect"" it from the threat of US military action. ""If the US is reckless enough to use military means it would mean from that very day, an all-out war,"" he said. The North casts the US as the aggressor. At a news conference at the UN on Monday, North Korea's permanent representative Ambassador Kim In-ryong, condemned the US missile strikes in Syria, which targeted an air base after a suspected chemical attack by the government. He said the US was ""disturbing global peace and stability and insisting on the gangster-like logic that its invasion of a sovereign state is decisive and just and proportionate and contributes to defending the international order"". How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? China has reiterated its call for North Korea to stop all tests, and has also called for a peaceful solution. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing on Monday that the Korean peninsula was ""highly sensitive, complicated and high risk"" and that all sides should ""avoid taking provocative actions that pour oil on the fire"". On Sunday, Lt Gen HR McMaster, the US top security adviser, said his country was working on a ""range of options"" with China, the first confirmation the two countries were co-operating to find a solution to the North Korean issue.  Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would not tolerate ""missile adventures by Pyongyang"" but a unilateral use of power by the US would be ""a very risky course"". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday told a parliamentary session that diplomatic efforts were ""important to maintain peace"", but ""dialogue for the sake of having dialogue is meaningless"". He added that Japan needed to apply pressure on Pyongyang to ""seriously respond to a dialogue"" with the international community.",Tuesday 18 April 2017,18-Apr-17,North Korea threatens new missile tests,"A senior official tells the BBC this may happen ""weekly"", as the US warns: ""Don't test Trump.""",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39623882
"Facebook murder suspect Steve Stephens hunted across US A nationwide manhunt is under way in the US for the suspect who shot dead a grandfather on the street apparently at random and posted the footage. The suspect, Steve Stephens, said in another video post that he had killed 13 people and would kill more. He shot dead 74-year-old Robert Godwin in Ohio as the victim walked home from Easter lunch on Sunday afternoon.  Facebook has launched a review of its procedures after criticism that the footage stayed on the site for hours. Justin Osofsky, Facebook’s vice-president of global operations, said the first complaint made about the video showing the killing came nearly two hours after it was posted. But he added: “We know we need to do better.”  A 'monster' who 'just snapped' Facebook to review violent content policies Police have asked residents of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania to be on the alert, saying suspect could be anywhere. Cleveland police department have issued a photo of Mr Stephens, 37, on its website, describing him as a black male, 6ft 1in (1.86m) and 244lb (110kg).  Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters on Monday that Mr Stephens, who has a licence to carry a concealed firearm, is armed ""without a doubt"".  Cleveland officials have also offered a $50,000 (£39,805) reward for information that leads to his location.  His mobile phone signal was last tracked on Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania. Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said in a press conference on Monday morning: ""Steve is still out there some place… we're still asking Steve to turn himself in, but if he doesn't we'll find him."" FBI Special Agent Stephen Anthony said: ""Quite frankly, he could be in a lot of places."" US Marshall Peter Elliot said law enforcement agencies across the US were helping create a dragnet to ""make this individual's world very, very, very small"". Investigators said Mr Stephens' boast about other killings was still not verified.   Police say the victim in Sunday's graphic video appeared to have been selected at random.  The suspect approaches Mr Godwin and asks him to say the name of a woman believed to be the gunman's former girlfriend, before shooting him in the head. ""Can you do me a favour?"" asks the gunman. ""Can you say Joy Lane?"" The victim says: ""Joy Lane."" Mr Stephen says: ""Yeah, she's the reason why all this about to happen to you. How old are you?"" The grandfather and father of nine appears to try to shield himself by holding up a plastic bag. The woman, Joy Lane, confirmed to CBS News that she and Mr Stephen had been in a ""relationship for several years"". ""I am sorry that all of this has happened. My heart & prayers goes out to the family members of the victim(s). Steve really is a nice guy... he is generous with everyone he knows.  ""He was kind and loving to me and my children,"" she wrote in a text message.  Maggie Green, the suspect's mother, told CNN that he was ""mad with his girlfriend. That's why he is shooting people and he won't stop until his mother or girlfriend tell him to stop.""

"Gunman's video prompts Facebook rethink Facebook has launched a review of how it deals with violent content on its network.  The announcement came after a video showing a killing was posted to Facebook on Sunday and remained there for more than two hours.  “We know we need to do better,” a company executive said.  Police are still looking for Steve Stephens, 37, who posted a video of the attack on Robert Godwin, 74, who was picked apparently at random.  Later Mr Stephens took to Facebook Live to discuss the killing, saying he had killed 13 people - though police say they are unaware of any other deaths.  Facebook has faced considerable criticism due to the length of time the violent video spent published on the network.  ""As a result of this terrible series of events, we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible,” wrote Justin Osofsky, Facebook’s vice-president of global operations.    ""In this case, we did not receive a report about the first video [which featured the suspect saying he intended to murder], and we only received a report about the second video - containing the shooting - more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted.  ""We received reports about the third video, containing the man’s live confession, only after it had ended.”  11:09AM PDT (19:09 GMT) - first video, of intent to murder, uploaded. Not reported to Facebook. 11:11AM PDT - second video, of shooting, uploaded. 11:22AM PDT - suspect confesses to murder while using Live, is live for 5 minutes. 11:27AM PDT - Live ends, and Live video is first reported shortly after. 12:59PM PDT - video of shooting is first reported. 1:22PM PDT - suspect's account disabled; all videos no longer visible to public. Mr Osofsky pointed out that the video showing the killing was on Facebook for an hour and forty-five minutes before it was flagged by a user. The video, and the user account, was taken down 23 minutes later, according to Facebook’s statement.  The company said as well as human moderation, artificial intelligence would be a useful tool in combating the sharing of this kind of material.  Facebook's annual developers' conference takes place in San Jose, California, on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

"Weetabix to be sold to US company Post Holdings UK cereal firm Weetabix is to be bought by US firm Post Holdings for $1.8bn (£1.4bn), its owner has confirmed. Weetabix - made in the UK since 1932 - was put up for sale in January by China's Bright Food, which bought a 60% stake in 2012. Bright's acquisition was the largest by a Chinese firm at the time, but it is believed to have struggled to build significant market share in China. Chinese consumers prefer a hot, rice-based breakfast to cold cereal. While Weetabix doubled sales in China in 2016, the UK still accounts for the majority of its sales. A spokesman for Bright Food, Pan Jianjun, said the sale of Weetabix did not mean the firm was abandoning its global ambitions. ""Going forward, Bright will stick to our overseas push,"" he said. Northamptonshire-based Weetabix, which has a royal warrant, was family-owned until 2004, when it was bought by private equity firm Lion Capital. Its main factory in Kettering produces three billion Weetabix biscuits every year.  It is the largest producer of breakfast cereals in the UK and employs about 2,000 people. Its products are exported to 80 countries, while it also has factories in Europe, east Africa and North America. Under the new ownership, Sally Abbott, currently director of marketing at Weetabix, will become managing director of Weetabix UK and Ireland. The current chief executive, Giles Turrell, will move to become the firm's chairman.  In a statement, Mr Turrell said: ""Post is a leader within its markets and shares our commitment to providing great tasting nutritious products for the whole family. I'm confident they will help us open doors for continued expansion."" Post Holdings is the third-largest cereal firm in the US and owns brands including Great Grains, Golden Crisp and Cocoa Pebbles. Some of the world's biggest names in food, including the UK's Associated British Foods and Italy's Barilla, had been named as possible suitors for Weetabix. ""Weetabix has struggled to crack the Chinese market, so it is no surprise to see Bright Food selling up,"" said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It's also unsurprising to see one of the UK's biggest cereal brands remain in foreign ownership, due to the pound's weakness.  ""UK-listed Associated British Foods was rumoured to have been interested in a deal, but any domestic buyers would have had to overcome the headwind of the pound's reduced buying power.

"Boy crushed in rotating restaurant named A boy who died after his head became lodged against a wall at a rotating restaurant in the US state of Georgia has been named.  Charlie Holt, five, was caught between a wall and a table as the popular Sun Dial Restaurant in Atlanta revolved on Friday. The rotating floor automatically shut off and restaurant employees were able to free the child. But Charlie suffered a head injury and was taken to hospital, where he died.   The family, who were visiting from North Carolina, released a statement on Saturday, asking ""for prayers and privacy right now to come to terms with this tragedy"".  ""No words can express their loss. If you have a loved one, please give them an extra hug today,"" the statement read. Police told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the boy died at Grady Memorial Hospital on Friday.  Sgt Warren Pickard called the incident ""very tragic"".   ""I simply think he lost sight of his parents and panicked,"" he said, ""and found himself in that situation.  ""A small child doesn't know what to do in those moments.""  Gustavo Anzola, who witnessed the incident, told the newspaper as many as six people worked to free the boy, who eventually lost consciousness.  ""A few seconds later, he fell into his dad's arms,"" Mr Anzola said. Police said the investigation is ongoing and the restaurant will remain closed until further notice, according to a spokesperson. The Sun Dial offers panoramic views of the city on the 72nd floor at the Westin Peachtree Plaza.  The boy's death is not the first fatal accident at the hotel.

"Prince Harry 'in total chaos' over mother Diana's death Prince Harry has revealed he sought counselling after spending nearly 20 years ""not thinking"" about the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said it was not until his late 20s that he processed the grief - after two years of ""total chaos"" and coming close to a ""complete breakdown"". But he was in a ""good place"" because of the ""process I have been through"". Harry, 32, also said boxing had ""saved"" him by helping him let out aggression. The Telegraph says Prince Harry had decided to talk about his past in the hope it would encourage people to break the stigma surrounding mental health issues. Along with his brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he is promoting the Heads Together mental health campaign, the London Marathon's charity of the year. Speaking to the paper's Bryony Gordon, Prince Harry said: ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well."" He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is a senior royal as we rarely see or hear them.   Prince Harry is part of the future of an institution that once embodied the British stiff-upper-lip approach to life.   Such an approach was dealt a blow by Diana, Princess of Wales.  In her 1995 BBC Panorama interview, she told Martin Bashir about her post-natal depression, her self-harming and her bulimia.   Now, Prince Harry is following his mother's example. In the podcast, which is a compelling listen, Harry admits to feeling nervous as he speaks openly about suffering from anxiety, coming close to a breakdown and being a ""problem"" for much of his 20s.  Prince Harry is this country's most high profile person yet to talk about his personal mental anguish.    His privileged life in a palace hasn't protected him from ill-health.   Diana's son hopes that his up-front display of honesty will help to break the taboo that still surrounds mental health.  Read more from Peter The Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. Prince Harry said: ""My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?"" ""(I thought) it's only going to make you sad, it's not going to bring her back. So from an emotional side, I was like 'right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything.'"" He described himself as a ""typical 20, 25, 28-year-old running around going 'life is great', or 'life is fine' and that was exactly it. ""And then [I] started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with."" He said he decided to act after his brother - the Duke of Cambridge - told him: ""Look, you really need to deal with this. It is not normal to think that nothing has affected you."" Prince Harry opened up to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon over a cup of tea at Kensington Palace during a half-hour interview recorded for a podcast on mental health issues. Gordon, who has previously spoken of her own struggles with bulimia, alcoholism and an obsessive compulsive disorder, said the pair had been alone in the room. She said it had been unusual to hear a royal talk for half an hour on any subject and described Prince Harry as ""really articulate and a sound guy"". Prince Harry said: ""Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever - the Americans call them shrinks - someone you have never met before.  ""You sit down on the sofa and say 'listen, I don't actually need your advice. Can you just listen'. And you just let it all rip."" Asked whether he had counselling, he said: ""I've done that a couple of times, more than a couple of times, but it's great."" But he said he could ""safely say"" his concerns were not related to his service as a soldier in Afghanistan. On taking up boxing, Prince Harry told the paper: ""Everyone was saying boxing is good for you and it's a really good way of letting out aggression. ""And that really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone."" Prince Harry said: ""Because of the process I have been through over the past two-and-a-half years, I've now been able to take my work seriously, been able to take my private life seriously as well, and been able to put blood, sweat and tears into the things that really make a difference and things that I think will make a difference to everybody else.""

"Prince death: Opioid painkillers found at singer's home Numerous opioid painkillers were found at US singer Prince's home shortly after his death last year, unsealed court documents show. Some of the pills discovered at Prince's Paisley Park estate in Minnesota had prescriptions in the name of his friend and bodyguard.  But the documents do not offer evidence about the source of the fentanyl that killed the singer on 21 April 2016. Medical examiners have concluded that he died from an accidental overdose. No-one has been charged over the death of the 57-year-old singer. The court documents were kept sealed until Monday because prosecutors feared potential witnesses might flee or potential evidence be destroyed. They show that some of the pills found at Prince's home were labelled ""Watson 853"" - the opioid painkiller acetaminophen-hydrocodone. They are used in the treatment of pain, rheumatoid arthritis and coughs. The unsealed documents also show that other ""numerous narcotic controlled substance pills"" were discovered in various containers, including vitamin bottles. Investigators were ""made aware by witnesses that were interviewed, that Prince recently had a history of going through withdrawals, which are believed to be the result of the abuse of prescription medication,"" the documents say. They confirm last year's media reports that painkillers were in the singer's possession following his death. According to the post-mortem report, Prince self-administered fentanyl, an opioid many times more powerful than heroin. Prince was found unresponsive in a lift at his complex.  He was a prolific writer and performer from a young age, reportedly writing his first song when he was seven. A singer, songwriter, arranger and multi-instrumentalist, Prince recorded more than 30 albums.

"Cascade Mall shooting: Suspected gunman found dead in prison cell A man accused of killing five people at a shopping mall in Washington state has been found hanging inside his prison cell, say officials. Arcan Cetin, 20, who had been awaiting trial for the mass shooting in 2016, was found dead in the Snohomish County Jail on Sunday night. He had been charged with five counts of aggravated murder, and could have faced the death penalty if found guilty. Authorities have not yet determined the cause of death. According to investigators, Cetin shot five shoppers at a Macy's department store after first trying to enter through the backdoor of a nearby cinema. The shooting spree at the Cascade shopping mall occurred less than three hours after he had sat down for dinner with his stepfather. Surveillance footage from inside the mall shows the suspect opening fire on four woman and one man as they browsed the store. Police say Cetin was inside the mall for less than one minute before he fled the store, leaving the .22 calibre rifle, which police say had been stolen from Cetin's stepfather, on a counter in the cosmetics department. He was arrested about 30 hours later as he walked near to his apartment in Oak Harbor, Washington, according to local media. Prosecutors said he confessed to the shootings, but that he did not reveal a motive. The victims - Sarai Lara, Shayla Martin, Belinda Galde, Beatrice Dotson, and Wilton Eagan - ranged in ages from 16 to 95 years old. Court records show that one year before the shooting Cetin was ordered by a judge to receive mental health treatment after a violent altercation with family members. After attempting suicide, he was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. He had been identified by doctors at the time of having a serious risk of self-harm, and had been receiving court-mandated mental health counselling in the months before the shooting.

"Turkey referendum: Erdogan dismisses criticism by monitors Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected criticism by monitors of Sunday's referendum in which he won sweeping new powers. ""Know your place,"" he said, after the observers said the president had been favoured by an ""unequal"" campaign.  The narrow victory was ruled valid by Turkey's electoral body, despite claims of irregularities by the opposition. US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Erdogan on his victory, as 51.4% of voters supported the changes. In a phone call, Mr Trump also thanked the Turkish leader for supporting the US missile strike on a Syrian government airbase on 7 April, the White House said. In a separate development, Turkey extended the state of emergency for three months. The measure, introduced after a failed coup last July, was set to expire in two days. Despite saying that the voting day was ""well administered"", the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe criticised the campaign, saying: ""In general, the referendum did not live up to Council of Europe standards,"" said Cezar Florin Preda, head of the Council of Europe delegation. The council is a pan-European human rights body of which Turkey is a member. The monitors also criticised a late change by electoral officials that allowed voting papers without official stamps to be counted. They said this move ""removed an important safeguard and were contested by the opposition. But the head of Turkey's electoral body, Sadi Guven, said the unstamped ballot papers had been produced by the High Electoral Board and were valid. He said a similar procedure had been used in past elections.  Turkey divisions exacerbated The referendum in numbers Addressing supporters in the presidential palace in Ankara, Mr Erdogan said that Turkey did not ""see, hear or acknowledge the politically motivated reports"" of the monitors. The result, he said, ended the debate on changing the constitution and creating an executive presidency, adding that the process of implementing the reforms would now begin. He also said the country could hold a referendum on its long-stalled EU membership bid. Additionally, Mr Erdogan said he would approve the death penalty if it was supported in a referendum or a bill was submitted to him through parliament. This would end Turkey's EU negotiations. Earlier, Turkey's foreign ministry said the remarks by the monitors lacked impartiality. ""Saying the referendum fell below international standards is unacceptable,"" it said in a statement. The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) has demanded a recount of 60% of the votes. Its deputy head said the result should be annulled altogether.  The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) also challenged the vote. Profile: Erdogan's rise to power Turkey referendum: Key reactions This was a damning verdict by the observer mission. From biased media coverage to a misuse of administrative resources by the president and government; and from restrictions on free speech to a decision to accept unstamped ballots, which ""contradicted the law""; the election observers concluded that the referendum did not fulfil international standards.

"Cascade Mall shooting: Suspected gunman found dead in prison cell A man accused of killing five people at a shopping mall in Washington state has been found hanging inside his prison cell, say officials. Arcan Cetin, 20, who had been awaiting trial for the mass shooting in 2016, was found dead in the Snohomish County Jail on Sunday night. He had been charged with five counts of aggravated murder, and could have faced the death penalty if found guilty. Authorities have not yet determined the cause of death. According to investigators, Cetin shot five shoppers at a Macy's department store after first trying to enter through the backdoor of a nearby cinema. The shooting spree at the Cascade shopping mall occurred less than three hours after he had sat down for dinner with his stepfather. Surveillance footage from inside the mall shows the suspect opening fire on four woman and one man as they browsed the store. Police say Cetin was inside the mall for less than one minute before he fled the store, leaving the .22 calibre rifle, which police say had been stolen from Cetin's stepfather, on a counter in the cosmetics department. He was arrested about 30 hours later as he walked near to his apartment in Oak Harbor, Washington, according to local media. Prosecutors said he confessed to the shootings, but that he did not reveal a motive. The victims - Sarai Lara, Shayla Martin, Belinda Galde, Beatrice Dotson, and Wilton Eagan - ranged in ages from 16 to 95 years old. Court records show that one year before the shooting Cetin was ordered by a judge to receive mental health treatment after a violent altercation with family members. After attempting suicide, he was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. He had been identified by doctors at the time of having a serious risk of self-harm, and had been receiving court-mandated mental health counselling in the months before the shooting.

"Turkey referendum: Erdogan dismisses criticism by monitors Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has rejected criticism by monitors of Sunday's referendum in which he won sweeping new powers. ""Know your place,"" he said, after the observers said the president had been favoured by an ""unequal"" campaign.  The narrow victory was ruled valid by Turkey's electoral body, despite claims of irregularities by the opposition. US President Donald Trump congratulated Mr Erdogan on his victory, as 51.4% of voters supported the changes. In a phone call, Mr Trump also thanked the Turkish leader for supporting the US missile strike on a Syrian government airbase on 7 April, the White House said. In a separate development, Turkey extended the state of emergency for three months. The measure, introduced after a failed coup last July, was set to expire in two days. Despite saying that the voting day was ""well administered"", the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe criticised the campaign, saying: ""In general, the referendum did not live up to Council of Europe standards,"" said Cezar Florin Preda, head of the Council of Europe delegation. The council is a pan-European human rights body of which Turkey is a member. The monitors also criticised a late change by electoral officials that allowed voting papers without official stamps to be counted. They said this move ""removed an important safeguard and were contested by the opposition. But the head of Turkey's electoral body, Sadi Guven, said the unstamped ballot papers had been produced by the High Electoral Board and were valid. He said a similar procedure had been used in past elections.  Turkey divisions exacerbated The referendum in numbers Addressing supporters in the presidential palace in Ankara, Mr Erdogan said that Turkey did not ""see, hear or acknowledge the politically motivated reports"" of the monitors. The result, he said, ended the debate on changing the constitution and creating an executive presidency, adding that the process of implementing the reforms would now begin. He also said the country could hold a referendum on its long-stalled EU membership bid. Additionally, Mr Erdogan said he would approve the death penalty if it was supported in a referendum or a bill was submitted to him through parliament. This would end Turkey's EU negotiations. Earlier, Turkey's foreign ministry said the remarks by the monitors lacked impartiality. ""Saying the referendum fell below international standards is unacceptable,"" it said in a statement. The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) has demanded a recount of 60% of the votes. Its deputy head said the result should be annulled altogether.  The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) also challenged the vote. Profile: Erdogan's rise to power Turkey referendum: Key reactions This was a damning verdict by the observer mission. From biased media coverage to a misuse of administrative resources by the president and government; and from restrictions on free speech to a decision to accept unstamped ballots, which ""contradicted the law""; the election observers concluded that the referendum did not fulfil international standards. So what now? It's sure to embolden the opposition in its attempts to challenge the results. But that is an uphill struggle in a country where the state machinery is so heavily controlled by the president and his inner circle and where around 80% of the media is pro-government, pushing its interpretation of the facts.

"French election: Le Pen pledges to suspend immigration One of the frontrunners in the French presidential election, far-right leader Marine Le Pen, says she would suspend all legal immigration to France.  The National Front (FN) leader told a rally that she wanted to stop ""a mad, uncontrolled situation"". Polls suggest she is neck and neck with centrist Emmanuel Macron, ahead of Sunday's first round of voting.  Mr Macron warned voters that choosing far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon would be like Cuba without the sun. Opinion polls predict that Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen will reach the second round on 7 May. But it looks like a very tight race. According to an Elabe poll for news channel BFMTV, Mr Macron is on course to get 24% of the vote in the first round, Marine Le Pen 23%, conservative Francois Fillon 19.5% and Mr Mélenchon 18%. Polls suggest that Mr Macron would be favourite to win in the run-off.  At a rally in Paris, Ms Le Pen said ""I would decide on a moratorium on all legal immigration to stop this frenzy, this uncontrolled situation that is dragging us down"".  After that, she said, France would introduce ""much more drastic, more reasonable, more humane, more manageable rules"" on immigration. Left-wing daily Liberation called it ""one of the most hardline speeches of her campaign"", aimed at satisfying grassroots supporters. In all, 11 candidates are competing in the first round. About a third of French voters are still undecided, opinion polls suggest, making it one of the most unpredictable elections in decades. Mr Fillon has been regaining some ground, polls suggest, despite being embroiled in corruption allegations.  Mr Mélenchon chose a barge on a Paris canal to rally his supporters and was set to use a hologram of himself to appear at several events across the country at once on Tuesday. Ms Le Pen said the choice for French voters was between her rivals' ""savage globalisation"" and her patriotism. Outside the venue, dozens of protesters, who had sought to disrupt her rally, clashed with police. Meanwhile, Mr Macron addressed almost 20,000 supporters at the Bercy national indoor arena. ""We are going to turn the page on the last 20 years because our generation is ready for change,"" he said. On the issue of France's role in the EU, he said: ""We need Europe, so we will remake it. I will be the president of the awakening of our European ambitions."" Mr Macron, a former investment banker running for his self-created En Marche (On the move) party, turned his fire on his opponents.  Ten of the 11 candidates wanted to take France back to a ""fantasy of the past"". For some, in a clear reference to Jean-Luc Mélenchon, it would be ""Cuba without the sun, or Venezuela without the oil"". Speaking from his campaign barge, Mr Mélenchon told his cheering supporters: ""Here you are on an Easter Monday listening to a guy on a boat. There's something in the air!"" Mr Mélenchon's ratings are thought to have been buoyed by recent televised debates. He promises to renegotiate EU treaties, pull out of Nato and end austerity in favour of a big stimulus package.

"Lake Malawi boat disaster: 'Man held on to bag of flour' A 67-year-old man has said he escaped death by clinging to a bag of maize flour after the boat he was on capsized on Lake Malawi.  Graciam Kondowe was among 54 passengers who police say survived after the boat overturned in stormy weather on Sunday.  Five people drowned while 11 are still missing, police said.  The boat was packed with worshippers returning from Easter celebrations when it capsized in the remote Rumphi district in northern Malawi.  Mr Kondowe told Malawi's privately owned Zodiac radio station that heavy winds buffeted the boat about 15 minutes into their journey.  The crew decided to return to shore, but the boat capsized before they could get back, he added.  Mr Kondowe said he held on to a bag of maize flour which fell out of the boat, and eventually swam his way to safety.  Eight of the 54 survivors are being treated in hospital after sustaining injuries, police officer Denis Banda said.   Locals residents used canoes to rescue most of the passengers, Malawian journalist Joab Chakhaza told the BBC. Search operations are continuing for the 11 people still missing, but the chances of finding them alive are slim, he adds.   Boats are a common mode of transport on the vast Lake Malawi, and accidents of this magnitude are rare.  In 2012, 47 migrants fleeing drought and conflict in Somalia and Ethiopia drowned in the lake after their boat capsized.

"Theresa May to seek general election on 8 June UK Prime Minister Theresa May has announced plans to call a snap general election on 8 June. She said Britain needed certainty, stability and strong leadership following the EU referendum. Explaining the decision, Mrs May said: ""The country is coming together but Westminster is not."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party wanted the election, calling it a chance to get a government that puts ""the majority first"". The prime minister will refuse to take part in televised leader debates ahead of the vote, Number 10 sources said. Mr Corbyn said Mrs May should not be ""dodging"" a head-to-head encounter, and the Lib Dems urged broadcasters to ""empty-chair"" the prime minister - hold a debate without her. Live TV debates took place for the first time in a UK general election in 2010, and the experiment was repeated in 2015 using a range of different formats. A BBC spokesman said that it was too early to say whether the broadcaster would put in a bid to stage a debate. There will be a vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday to approve the election plan - the prime minister needs two thirds of MPs to vote in favour to bring forward the next scheduled election date of 2020. Explaining her change of heart on an early election, Mrs May said: ""I have concluded the only way to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead is to hold this election."" She accused Britain's other political parties of ""game playing"", adding that this risks ""our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country"". ""So we need a general election and we need one now. We have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done  while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin. ""I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion. Since I became prime minister I've said there should be no election until 2020, but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and security for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions we must take."" In a statement outside Number 10, Mrs May said Labour had threatened to vote against the final Brexit agreement and cited opposition to her plans from the Scottish National Party, the Lib Dems and ""unelected"" members of the House of Lords. ""If we don't hold a general election now, their political game-playing will continue and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election,"" she said. Senior government sources point to a specific factor that changed the prime minister's calculation on an early election. The end of the likely tortuous Article 50 negotiations is a hard deadline set for March 2019. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, that's when the Tories would be starting to prepare for a general election the following year, with what one cabinet minister described as certain ""political needs"". In other words, the government would be exposed to hardball from the EU because ministers would be desperate to avoid accepting anything that would be politically unpopular, or hold the Brexit process up, at the start of a crucial election cycle. Ministers say that's the central reason for May's change of heart because ""if there was an election in three years, we'd be up against the clock"". Read Laura's latest blog in full The PM challenged the opposition parties: ""Let us tomorrow vote for an election - let us put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programmes for government and then let the people decide. ""The decision facing the country will be all about leadership. It will be a choice between strong and stable leadership in the national interest, with me as your prime minister, or weak and unstable coalition government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, propped up by the Liberal Democrats - who want to reopen the divisions of the referendum - and Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP."" Mr Corbyn said he welcomed the prime minister's decision, saying it would ""give the British people the chance to vote for a government that will put the interests of the majority first"", saying that this would include dealing with ""the crisis"" in housing, education funding and the NHS and pushing for an ""economy that works for all"". He told the BBC: ""I'm starting straight away and I'm looking forward to it and we'll take our message to every single part of this country... We're campaigning to win this election - that's the only question now."" Asked if he will be the next prime minister, the Labour leader said: ""If we win the election - yes - and I want to lead a government that will transform this country, give real hope to everybody and above all bring about a principle of justice for everybody and economic opportunities for everybody."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would be fighting the election ""to win"". ""I think the prime minister has called this election for selfish, narrow, party political interests, but she has called it and therefore I relish the prospect of getting out to stand up for Scotland's interests and values, standing up for Scotland's voice being heard and standing against the ability of a right-wing Conservative Party to impose whatever policies it wants on Scotland."" In his response to Mrs May's announcement, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron tweeted: ""This is your chance to change the direction of your country. If you want to avoid a disastrous hard Brexit. If you want to keep Britain in the single market. If you want a Britain that is open, tolerant and united, this is your chance."" He also accused the PM of ""bottling"" the TV debates and urged broadcasters to ""empty chair"" her if she refused to take part. Mrs May spoke to the Queen on the phone on Easter Monday to let her know of the election plan, the prime minister's official spokesman said. She also got the full backing of the cabinet before calling the election. Former prime minister David Cameron called Theresa May's decision to hold a snap general election ""brave and right"". In a tweet, he added: ""My very best wishes to all Conservative candidates."" Another ex-PM, Tony Blair, said voters need to put election candidates under ""sustained pressure"" to say whether or not they would vote against a Brexit deal which does not deliver the same benefits as single market membership - or against a ""damaging"" decision to leave without a deal. ""This should cross party lines,"" he added. British business groups gave a mixed response to the prime minister's sudden call for a general election, as the pound jumped on the news and shares fell. European Council President Donald Tusk's spokesman said the 27 other EU states would forge ahead with Brexit, saying the UK election would not change their plans. He added: ""We expect to have the Brexit guidelines adopted by the European Council on 29 April and following that the Brexit negotiating directives ready on 22 May. This will allow the EU27 to start negotiations.""",Wednesday 19 April 2017,19-Apr-17,May to seek snap UK election for 8 June,The prime minister needs Parliament's backing to hold a vote before the next scheduled date of 2020.,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39629603

"California gunman kills three 'in race attack' in Fresno Three white men were killed and another wounded when a black gunman opened fire in Fresno, California, in a suspected race attack, police have said. Kori Ali Muhammad shot 16 rounds in 90 seconds in the shooting spree on Tuesday, said Police Chief Jerry Dyer. He shouted ""God is greatest"" in Arabic when arrested but this was a hate crime not terrorism, Mr Dyer believed. Mr Muhammad, 39, was also wanted for the murder of a security guard outside a motel in the city last week.  The mass shooting may have been sparked by the release of his photo to the media on Tuesday afternoon, police say. Dozens of people marched to the downtown shooting scene on Tuesday afternoon to show support for ""peace and reconciliation"". A Muslim leader in the city said Mr Muhammad did not represent Islam. Why America remains segregated All four victims were white men, and one of them was shot sitting in a car. Media in the city named him as Zackary Randalls, a 34-year-old father of two who was on his first day in his new job as a utility worker. Family members identified another victim as 37-year-old Mark Gassett, who had just left Catholic Charities with a shopping bag of food when he was shot, his family said. The suspect had indicated on social media that he hated white people and expressed anti-government views, police said. ""He wanted to kill as many people as he could and that's what he set out to do,"" said Mr Dyer. ""This was a random act of violence. These were unprovoked attacks by an individual who was intent on carrying out homicides today.""  Mr Dyer added that Tuesday's attack ""has nothing to do with terrorism in spite of the statements that he [Kori Ali Muhammad] made"".  ""He did clarify that the reason he had made that statement was that in the event that anything did happen to him that he was in fact pledging his allegiance to God for protection."" The most recent statistics compiled by the University of Southern California's Center for Religion and Civic Culture showed that Fresno, a city of just over 500,000 people, had a Muslim population of just over 1,800 in 2000. In a statement on Facebook, the Islamic Cultural Center of Fresno condemned the attack, saying: ""The phrase Allahu Akbar, or God is Great, is a prayer of peace for 1.8 billion Muslims around the world."" The centre's Imam, Seyed Ali Ghazvini, said Mr Muhammad was not known to them.  ""This individual does not represent our faith or our community,"" he told the Fresno Bee newspaper. ""This individual does not represent your Muslim neighbour, your Muslim classmate or your co-worker. The Muslim community in the Valley are working hard for the well-being of our society and country."" The shooting began around 10:45 local time near the headquarters for Catholic Charities. Witnesses said they saw a man carrying a large handgun, reportedly a .357 revolver, which he reloaded several times between shots.  Police were not able to immediately find the gun, and believe it may have been picked up by a passerby. Mr Muhammad's father later told the Los Angeles Times that his son believed he was part of an ongoing war between whites and blacks and that ""a battle was about to take place"". He went by the nickname Black Jesus. Mr Muhammad, who was born as Kori Taylor, was imprisoned in 2005 for gun and cocaine charges. A former classmate at the Fresno City College said he would often not show up for classes for weeks at a time, and accuse his instructors of being racist. ""He's very, very unstable,"" Derek Bavin told KSEE-TV News.

"France arrests over 'pre-election attack plot' Two men have been arrested on suspicion of planning an ""imminent"" attack in France, days before the first round of the French presidential election.  Police said they found explosives and several guns at a flat linked to the suspects. The two Frenchmen, aged 23 and 29, were detained in Marseille on Tuesday. They were reportedly radicalised in prison. France remains under a state of emergency after a series of attacks that have claimed about 230 lives. Three of the leading candidates in the presidential election - Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen and François Fillon - were warned last week of security risks linked to the two men, party officials said. The suspects are Mahiedine M, 29, from Croix near the Belgian border, and Clément B, aged 23 from Ermont, north of Paris. The two men had met in prison, and were known to police as Islamist radicals. French prosecutor François Molins said they had been planning an ""imminent"" attack but the target, or targets, remained unknown. He said they had made three kilograms of the highly volatile explosive TATP, with one batch ready for use.  Mahiedine M had made a video featuring the black flag of the so-called Islamic State group, an Uzi sub-machine gun, and a newspaper depicting a presidential candidate, Mr Molins said The DGSI domestic intelligence service is said to suspect the pair of plotting an attack to coincide with the election. The men were being held as part of an inquiry into ""criminal terrorist association and violating the law on arms relating to a terrorist enterprise"". 'A significant threat': Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris It is a working assumption of the French intelligence services that Islamist extremists would like to target the elections.     The line of reasoning goes like this: if there is a lethal attack, then people are more likely to vote for the far-right - and that is what the jihadists want, because a victory for Marine Le Pen could tip the country into chaos. Much remains to be told about the pair who have been arrested in Marseille.  We do not know who or what it was they were allegedly planning to attack. We do not know if they were guided by figures from abroad. But until evidence suggests otherwise, their enterprise will be treated as a significant and genuine threat.   With France approaching the climax of the election campaign, the arrests became a major political development on Tuesday. It has emerged that centre-right candidate François Fillon was warned of ""confirmed risks"" late last week, with the focus said to be an Easter rally in Nice.  A Fillon spokesman told French media that since Thursday ""the security detail was reinforced around him during his travels"". Photos of the two suspects were also circulated last week to security officers looking after the two election front-runners: centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen.  Mr Macron called for unity and said the arrests were a reminder of the ""strong terrorist threat"" facing France.  Ms Le Pen has accused the government of failing to tackle militant Islamists and her adviser, Florian Philippot, said on French TV that ""our democracy itself, our voting operation and electoral campaigns are under threat"".  Far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, himself riding high in the opinion polls, sent text messages of support to Mr Fillon and Mr Macron offering his ""complete solidarity"". Eleven candidates will contest the first round on 23 April, with the top two qualifying for the run-off on 7 May. The interior minister said 50,000 members of the security forces were being deployed for the elections, particularly at polling stations.  President François Hollande praised the Marseille operation, which began after 10:00 (08:00 GMT), as a ""remarkable capture"". Although no major attack has been carried out on French soil in recent months, two soldiers were attacked with machetes outside the Louvre museum in Paris in February. In the same month, three men and a 16-year-old girl were detained in Montpellier on suspicion of planning a bomb attack. France has been under a state of emergency since the Paris attacks in November 2015 and officials say the risk is still very high, pointing to recent murders in the UK and Sweden.

"Georgia election: Republicans stave off snub to Trump A Democrat has narrowly failed to snatch a Republican stronghold in an election seen as a test of President Donald Trump's popularity. Jon Ossoff fell short of the 50% needed to win outright in a congressional vote in Georgia and there will be a run-off. Mr Ossoff ran on a Make Trump Furious ticket in a suburban Atlanta seat that has been Republican since the 1970s. Mr Trump took a keen interest in the race and said the result was a ""BIG 'R' win"". The seat was made vacant when Congressman Tom Price left to join the Trump administration as US health secretary.  Mr Ossoff won 48.1% of the vote with all 210 precincts reporting. The Democratic Party candidate will now face Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, in the 20 June run-off for the seat in Georgia's 6th Congressional District.  She came a distant second with 19.8%. There were 11 Republicans among 18 candidates in the first-round primary, which had divided conservative support. Mr Ossoff said: ""This is already a victory for the ages. We have defied the odds, we have shattered expectations."" Republicans believe the run-off will favour them in a seat they have held since 1979, when it was won by Newt Gingrich, but the Democrats have spent a large amount of money on the campaign and will press hard for victory. Mr Ossoff, a 30-year-old political newcomer, most recently worked as a documentary filmmaker after serving as a congressional aide to Georgia representative John Lewis. Despite his lack of experience, he raised a whopping $8.3m (£6.5m) in the first quarter, making it one of the most expensive congressional races ever. Mr Trump tweeted: ""Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG 'R' win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!"" Democrats in Georgia will be celebrating, and commiserating tonight. On one hand, Jon Ossoff achieved a big victory. With very little political experience he came out top in a solidly safe Republican seat. But he didn't win big enough to take the fast lane to Congress and needs to win the run-off. Republicans - including the president, who has been following this closely - will be also be celebrating and commiserating. While they didn't lose control of the 6th district, this seat should never have been in contention. They will be hoping their chances will be much stronger now they only have one, instead of 11 candidates, on the ballot. Karen Handel has experience and name recognition. But, in a race which is being framed as a referendum on the Trump presidency, will she align or distance herself from him? In November's presidential race, Mr Trump only beat Hillary Clinton in this district by the tiniest of margins. Republicans were spared humiliation last week when they narrowly defended a deeply conservative Kansas seat vacated when Mr Trump appointed Congressman Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. A Democrat majority win on Tuesday would have been a major embarrassment for President Trump and could have spurred Republican lawmakers in competitive districts elsewhere in the country to distance themselves from him ahead of the nationwide 2018 mid-term elections. Sensing the danger, Mr Trump had attacked Mr Ossoff in tweets on Tuesday morning as a ""super Liberal Democrat"" who was ""very weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes"".",Wednesday 19 April 2017,19-Apr-17,Democrats aim for upset win in Georgia,President Trump and Hollywood celebrities have entered the fray in the off-year election race.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39633669

"'WhatsApp child sex images' led to arrests A network apparently using WhatsApp to distribute images of child sexual exploitation has been disrupted by dozens of arrests, according to police. A total of 39 suspects were apprehended in Europe and South America, following action by the Spanish National Police, Europol and Interpol. Spanish investigators discovered dark web sites directing users to private WhatsApp groups last year. Researchers then verified these groups were used to share illegal images. House searches conducted during the arrests had led to the seizure of ""hundreds of devices containing several terabytes of child sexual exploitation material"", according to Europol. Spanish police have added that this included more than 360,000 files. Operation Tantalio involved co-ordinated action in Germany, Spain and Portugal as well as several South American countries including Argentina, Chile and Ecuador. Interpol has said that ""hundreds"" of the images and videos discovered have been entered into its international child sexual exploitation (ICSE) database.

"Trump order to target foreign worker visa programme President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to review a temporary visa programme used to place foreign workers in high-skilled US jobs. The order directs agencies to enforce government rules on excluding foreign contractors from bids for government projects.  He signed the so-called Buy America, Hire America order on a visit to a tool factory in the US state of Wisconsin. The order is aimed at fulfilling his ""America First"" campaign promises.  But it falls way short of Mr Trump's campaign pledge to end the H-1B visa programme. Mr Trump will direct the departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security and Labour to propose reforms to the scheme, which allows American employers to bring foreign workers to fill US jobs.  ""With this action we are sending a powerful signal to the world that were going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and finally put America first,"" he said at the Snap-On Inc headquarters in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Mr Trump's wife Melania used an H-1B visa in her early days as a model in New York, says the BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Washington.  For now, Indian IT firms are trying to put on a brave face publicly. The boss of India's largest IT company - Tata Consultancy Services - has said that the current discourse on the issue in the US is driven by ""emotions"".  But they are confident that greater ""engagement"" with the Trump administration will help soften their stance towards H-1B visas. But privately executives at most Indian IT firms will admit they are worried. They believe that President Trump is serious about bringing back jobs to the US. And any changes to the work visa process is bad news for India's $150bn IT service industry.  Last year, it generated $64.8bn of revenue. And if they are forced to recruit employees from the US - which would lead to higher costs - then that would affect their profitability in the long term. The administration's goal is to ensure such visas are given to the most qualified or highest-paid applicant, according to two senior officials.  The four departments will then submit their findings to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and release a report in 220 days.  Last year, Disney was accused of taking advantage of the H-1B visa scheme to lay off American technology workers, who were forced to train their foreign replacements. The government allows 85,000 immigrants each year through the H-1B visa programme, which is reserved for foreign nationals in ""specialty occupations"" and is largely used by the technology industry. The government uses a lottery system to grant 65,000 visas every year and randomly distributes an additional 20,000 to graduate students.  In recent years, the US has been overwhelmed by applications for the programme.  But the number of applicants fell to 199,000 this year, down from 236,000 in 2016, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services.  A senior Trump administration official argued on Monday that the H-1B visas are supposed to be awarded to highly qualified workers, but often bring in less skilled employees who earn lower wages than those they are meant to replace.  Under the new order, the H-1B visa would no longer serve as a cheap way for companies to replace US workers, the official added.  Tech companies contend the programme is used to recruit top talent, but some of the H-1B visas are also used for outsourcing firms. Critics say these undercut unemployed Americans and fill lower-level information technology jobs.  Indian nationals are the largest group of recipients of the H-1B visas issued each year.  More than 15% of Facebook's US employees last year used a temporary work visa, according to a Reuters analysis of US Labour Department filings. The executive order will also focus on reviewing waivers in free-trade agreements and whether they allow foreign firms to undermine American companies in the global government procurement market.  ""If it turns out America is a net loser because of those free-trade agreement waivers, which apply to almost 60 countries, these waivers may be promptly renegotiated or revoked,"" a second official said.",Wednesday 19 April 2017,19-Apr-17,Trump targets foreign worker visa scheme,India's technology sector is worried about the US president's order to overhaul a visa programme.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39632182
"Jakarta election: Christian governor concedes to Muslim rival Jakarta's first Christian governor has conceded defeat to a Muslim former government minister in a vote seen as a test of Indonesia's secular identity. Basuki Tjahaja Purnama congratulated his rival after exit polls showed Anies Rasyid Baswedan clearly ahead. Critics of Mr Purnama had accused him of blasphemy, heightening racial and religious tensions. Mr Baswedan was accused of courting hardliners. The new mayor takes office in October. Official results come in May. ""We now will come together and forget this campaign. Jakarta is home for all of us,"" Mr Purnama, popularly known as Ahok, said in a nationally televised news conference. ""We understand that our supporters are disappointed. But don't dwell on it."" Mr Baswedan hinted he would try to heal divisions, saying: ""We celebrate diversity... We are all ready to work together again.""  Hardline Islamist groups say Mr Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, insulted a Koranic verse during a campaign speech and have rallied large crowds against him in recent months. He is now on trial for blasphemy, which he denies.  Correspondents say this made the election a choice between secularism and a growing hardline Islamist movement. The run-off election between the two men came after no candidate secured more than half the votes in the first round. Shortly after polls closed, unofficial counts by private polling companies showed Mr Baswedan had secured a strong lead, with a margin in the double digits. Police said the election proceeded ""smoothly and safely with no significant disruption"". They had warned against voter intimidation. A coalition of hardline Islamic groups supporting Mr Basedan had previously said it would send at least 100 activists to each polling station to monitor voting. But correspondents said they had a very limited presence. Mr Purnama voted with his family in north Jakarta early on Wednesday morning and urged voters not to be afraid. Rizieq Shihab, leader of the Islamic Defenders Front which has been leading protests against Mr Purnama, also cast his vote. Asked by the BBC if his group was damaging Indonesia's pluralist democracy, he said: ""Democracy doesn't stop someone from voting for a person from the same religion as you.... Christian vote for Christian, Muslims vote for Muslim."" The election has also seen anti-Chinese sentiment, sparking unease in a country that has seen violence against its Chinese minority in the past.  A number of Chinese Indonesians who turned up to vote told the BBC that they had not been intimidated. ""Politics is cruel. There will be threats, physically or verbally. But I still feel comfortable even though I'm of Chinese descent... So far they only scream out hatred but haven't really acted on it,"" one voter, Rudi Irmawan, told the BBC. Mr Purnama was accused last year of insulting a Koranic verse during a campaign speech, which he has denied, saying his comments were aimed at politicians ""incorrectly"" using the Koran against him.  Hardline Islamists have cited that verse from the Koran to support an argument that Muslims should not vote for a non-Muslim leader. If convicted, Mr Purnama faces a maximum five-year jail sentence. His trial is due to resume on Thursday. Observers say the controversy clearly hurt Mr Purnama's chances. Once considered the clear frontrunner, he won the first round of the election in February with only 43% of the vote, while Mr Baswedan had 40%. The Jakarta Post has described the campaign as ""the dirtiest, most polarising and most divisive the nation has ever seen"". Indonesia is the world's most-populous Muslim country. About 85% of its population are Muslim, but the country officially respects six religions.",Wednesday 19 April 2017,19-Apr-17,Jakarta votes in divisive run-off poll,"The incumbent governor, a Christian on trial for blasphemy, faces his conservative Muslim rival.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39636974
"North Korea missile launch a 'provocation', US defence chief says The US has accused North Korea of trying to ""provoke something"", after Pyongyang conducted a failed missile test over the weekend. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said the test was a reckless move and the US was ""working closely"" with China to engage North Korea.  The missile fired on Sunday blew up almost immediately, the Pentagon said. Pyongyang said it may test missiles on a weekly basis, and warned of ""all-out war"" if the US takes military action. ""If the US is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method,"" Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the BBC on Monday. Both sides have ratcheted up the rhetoric following North Korea's latest missile test. Mr Mattis said Sunday's missile test had not involved an intercontinental ballistic missile but had still been reckless. ""It shows why we are working so closely right now with the Chinese... to try to get this under control and aim for the denuclearised Korean peninsula,"" he said. On Tuesday, a report in the Guardian newspaper quoted unnamed officials as saying the US was considering shooting down North Korean missile tests as a show of strength. The US is also threatening tougher economic sanctions that could include an oil embargo, a global ban on North Korea's airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks that do business with the country, Reuters news agency says. However, it has emerged that a US aircraft carrier, which the US said had been deployed towards the Korean peninsula earlier this month, had actually been sailing in the opposite direction. On 8 April, the navy said it had ordered the USS Carl Vinson to ""sail north"" as a deterrent against North Korea.  A few days later, Mr Mattis said the aircraft carrier was ""on her way up there"". US President Donald Trump also told Fox News on 12 April: ""We are sending an armada, very powerful."" However, a navy photo released on 15 April revealed that the aircraft carrier had actually sailed further south, to the Sunda Strait near Indonesia, to take part in planned drills with Australian forces in the Indian Ocean. The USS Carl Vinson is now set to head north towards the Korean peninsula, a defence official told AFP news agency. North Korea has accelerated its nuclear and missile tests in recent years, despite international condemnation and UN sanctions. Its aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach targets around the world, including the US. North Korea claims it has successfully made nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a missile - but this has never been independently verified, and some experts have cast doubts on the claims. Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the BBC that North Korea believed its nuclear weapons ""protect"" it from the threat of US military action. The North fears the US and South Korea could use force in an attempt to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong-un. At the UN on Monday, North Korea's permanent representative Ambassador Kim In-ryong condemned the US missile strikes in Syria, which targeted an air base after a suspected chemical attack by the government. He said the US was ""disturbing global peace and stability and insisting on the gangster-like logic that its invasion of a sovereign state is decisive and just and proportionate and contributes to defending the international order"". Observers say North Korea may carry out a sixth nuclear test soon.  China has criticised North Korea's missile tests. In February it banned imports of North Korean coal and reports in Chinese media have raised the possibility of restricting shipments of oil to the isolated North if the tests continue. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing on Monday that the Korean peninsula was ""highly sensitive, complicated and high risk"" and that all sides should ""avoid taking provocative actions that pour oil on the fire"". Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would not tolerate ""missile adventures by Pyongyang"" but a unilateral use of power by the US would be ""a very risky course"".

"Algeria parties ordered to show female faces on posters Algerian political parties have agreed to show female candidates' faces after some posters displayed blank avatars instead, the state news agency says. Parties in Bordj Bou Arreridj Province had been showing hijabs surrounding blank spaces alongside photos of male candidates. On Tuesday the election authorities gave parties two days to display photos or be removed from the vote. An official said the practice was illegal. ""This kind of encroachment is dangerous; it is not legal and it opposes all laws and traditions,"" said Hassan Noui of the Independent High Authority for Election Monitoring (HIISE). ""It is every citizen's right to know whom he will vote for.""  He said at least five parties including the Socialist Forces Front (FFS) had not been showing female candidates' faces on posters. The blank images have prompted debate inside Algeria.  One candidate, Fatma Tirbakh, from the National Front for Social Justice party in the eastern Ouargla Province, appeared as a blank female avatar on Ennahar TV to discuss the issue. ""Displaying my photo is important, I believe. But I come from a southern region. Honestly speaking, it is hugely conservative... it is because of this that my own photo is not used,"" she said. ""In all honesty, the family did force me not to show my photo on TV. But they do not have a problem with my face being on a poster,"" she said. However no one in her family had a problem with her working as a politician representing people in parliament, she added. Parties are obliged to field female candidates under a 2012 law requiring women to make up between 20% and 50% of candidates on electoral lists. FFS official Hassen Ferli blamed the party's communications team in Bordj Bou Arreridj for the ""regrettable"" posters. ""The FFS vigorously condemns this practice which is incompatible with the party's values,"" he said in a statement carried on local media. The party was committed to equality between men and women, the statement said. Algeria is not the only country in which women running for parliament have had their faces concealed on election posters.

"'Facebook killer' Steve Stephens found dead after car chase A man suspected of randomly shooting a grandfather and posting video of it to Facebook has taken his own life. Police tracked down Steve Stephens after he was spotted by employees at a drive-thru McDonald's in Pennsylvania, who stalled his order and rang 911. State police gave chase and the suspect shot himself ""as the vehicle was spinning out of control"", police said. Stephens, 37, shot dead Robert Godwin, 74, as the victim walked home from Easter lunch on Sunday in Cleveland. The fugitive's mobile phone signal was last tracked on Sunday afternoon to Erie, 100 miles (160km) from where Mr Godwin was shot. A 'monster' who 'just snapped' Zuckerberg addresses 'Facebook killing' Facebook to review violent content policies Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson told a news conference: ""We have closure in regards to the search for Steve Stephens.""  Pennsylvania State Police said that they had received a tip-off from workers at the fast food chain shortly after 11:00 on Tuesday. The suspect's white Ford Fusion car had been spotted in the car park of the McDonald's in the city of Erie, near a local police headquarters. Stephens ordered a 20-piece McNuggets meal and a large order of fries, but employees held his fries while they alerted police. Henry Sayers, the restaurant's manager, told the New York Times: ""He just took his nuggets and said: 'I have to go', and he drove off.""  State police pursued him for less than two miles before executing a tactic that involves ramming the rear of a vehicle to make it lose control. ""As the vehicle was spinning out of control from the PIT manoeuvre, Stephens pulled a pistol and shot himself in the head,"" Pennsylvania state police said in a statement.   During the encounter there were no injuries to members of the public or officers, and Stephens was pronounced dead at the scene, added Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams. Investigators said they were still baffled as to what motivated Stephens - who worked as a case manager for a children's mental health facility.  Police said earlier on Tuesday that authorities had received more than 400 tips, including as far away as Texas.  In other Facebook videos Stephens posted on the day of Mr Godwin's killing, the suspect said he had ""just snapped"", blaming gambling debts and a broken-down relationship among other things. The family of Mr Godwin - a father of 10 and grandfather of 14 - said on Monday they forgave the suspected killer. His daughter, Tonya Godwin-Baines, had urged Stephens to surrender.  ""Each one of us forgives the killer, the murderer,"" she told Cleveland TV station WJW. ""We want to wrap our arms around him."" ""I forgive you and love you, but most importantly, God loves you. God can heal your mind and save your soul."" The victim's son, Robert Godwin Jr, said: ""Steve, I forgive you... I'm not happy what you did, but I forgive you."" Cleveland officials had announced a reward of up to $50,000 (£39,000) for information leading to the suspect's arrest.  Facebook has launched a review of its procedures after criticism that the footage stayed on the site for hours. On Tuesday at the company's annual conference in San Jose, California,  founder Mark Zuckerberg said: ""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Snr.

"Air Canada apologises after 'bumping' boy, 10, from flight Canada's largest airline, Air Canada, has apologised after giving a 10-year-old boy's seat to someone else. Cole Doyle and his family had planned a trip to Costa Rica but the first leg of the journey was overbooked. The family travelled to two other airports and spent an extra C$1,000 (£590) to get a flight. The airline has now offered them compensation. It comes after video of a man being dragged from a US flight brought booking practices to public attention. Dr David Dao has said he will sue United Airlines after he lost two front teeth and his nose was broken when the airline called security officers in to help remove him from the plane. He had refused to leave when the airline asked for volunteers to make way for staff members. In response to the huge backlash the company faced on social media, United said it would allocate seats for staff at least an hour in advance, in future. It also promised it would no longer ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers. Separately in the UK, two passengers were asked to leave an Easyjet flight they had already boarded, and told the next flight to their destination was in four days. They decided not to reschedule, as they had booked non-refundable accommodation. After the United incident, the Canadian government announced it would overhaul the rules to ""ensure that passengers' rights are protected"". But well before that, Cole Doyle and his brother and parents were inconvenienced by an overbooking problem. In March, the Doyle family tried to check in online to their flight to Montreal but could not assign a seat to Cole. When they got to the airport at Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island, they were told there was no seat for him as the flight had been overbooked. His mother, Shanna, asked whether an adult could give up their seat for Cole but was told that even if someone did so, it would be likely to go to another passenger and could not be guaranteed for the boy. The family drove the two hours to Moncton in neighbouring New Brunswick, in the hope of getting on another flight. ""I'm crying in the back seat,"" Cole told the Canadian broadcaster CBC afterwards.""Like how do I get to where I'm going? I don't know if I'm even going to make it with my family."" Once they got there, though, they found out the flight they wanted had been cancelled. ""I thought it was a joke,"" said Cole's father, Brett. ""People are fed up. You shouldn't be able to sell something twice."" The family eventually made it to Montreal and caught a connecting flight to Costa Rica for their holiday, but have since complained to Air Canada and received an offer of a C$2,500 (£1,500) voucher, along with an apology. An airline spokeswoman told the Canadian Press news agency: ""We are currently following up to understand what went wrong and have apologised to Mr Doyle and his family as well as offered a very generous compensation to the family for their inconvenience.""

"US accuses Iran of 'alarming provocations' amid nuclear tensions The US secretary of state has accused Iran of ""alarming ongoing provocations"" aimed at destabilising the Middle East and undermining America's interests. ""An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and to take the world along with it,"" Rex Tillerson said. The US has ordered a review of the Iran nuclear deal, although it admits Iran is complying with its commitments. Iran's foreign minister dismissed Mr Tillerson's criticism as ""worn out"". The country has repeatedly denied accusations by the West that it was ever trying to develop nuclear weapons. On Tuesday, Washington accused North Korea of trying to ""provoke something"", after Pyongyang conducted a failed missile test over the weekend. North Korea said it may test missiles on a weekly basis, and warned of ""all-out war"" if the US takes military action. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr Tillerson said a review, which he had announced in a letter to Congress a day earlier, would look at the whole US policy towards Iran - taking in not only Tehran's compliance with the nuclear deal but also its actions in the Middle East. He accused the country of ""alarming and ongoing provocations that export terror and violence, destabilising more than one country at a time"". ""Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining US interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel."" As part of a long list of charges, he criticised Iran's involvement in the Syrian conflict and its support for President Bashar al-Assad. The secretary of state earlier acknowledged the Iranians had met the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal. But he said its ""nuclear ambitions"" remained ""a grave risk to international peace and security"". Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif reacted angrily on Twitter, saying ""worn-out US accusations"" could not ""mask its admission of Iran's compliance"" with the deal's requirements. He called on the US to change course and fulfil its own commitments. President Donald Trump has previously vowed to dismantle the nuclear deal but has not specified what he wants to do. The landmark 2015 agreement saw crippling sanctions on Iran lifted. It was secured after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certified that Tehran had restricted its sensitive nuclear activities. Barack Obama argued the deal, between Iran and six world powers including China, Russia and the UK, was the best way to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon. But President Trump has described the landmark agreement as the ""worst deal ever"". Read more: What does the Iran nuclear deal say? Iran says its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and that it will continue missile development. One of the key requirements of the deal is the reconfiguration of Iran's Arak nuclear reactor so it does not produce weapons-grade plutonium usable in a nuclear bomb.  On Thursday, Beijing said companies in China and Iran would be working together on the redesign to ensure these terms would be met. Analysis by BBC State Department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher In announcing a broad review of Iran policy the Trump administration has not jettisoned the nuclear deal.  But Rex Tillerson has come pretty close to saying the agreement is not worth keeping, even though he's had to admit it's working. This week the secretary of state informed Congress that Tehran is keeping its side of the bargain to restrict its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, which he's required to confirm every 90 days.  In spoken remarks, though, he talked only of Iran's bad behaviour and linked that to the future of the deal - a message that will resonate far more on Capitol Hill and to which it was probably aimed.  Former President Barack Obama would have agreed with all the charges: that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, that it supports proxies which undermine US interests in the region, that it's hostile to Israel and that its ballistic missile tests challenge UN Security Council prohibitions.  But Mr Obama kept those issues separate from the nuclear agreement, which would have been impossible to achieve without that narrow focus.  Mr Tillerson, on the other hand, called this a mistaken approach and said the review would take a comprehensive look at all of the threats posed by Iran.  Read more from Barbara President Donald Trump has stepped up US pressure on North Korea, which has accelerated its nuclear and missile tests in recent years, despite international condemnation and UN sanctions. North Korea's aim is to be able to put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach targets around the world, including the US. Mr Trump has said that will not happen, and ""all options are on the table"" in dealing with Pyongyang.

"Venezuela crisis: Three killed at anti-government protests At least three people have been killed in Venezuela in protests against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. A teenager in the capital Caracas and a woman in San Cristobal, near the Colombian border, were shot dead.  A national guardsman was killed south of the capital. Tens of thousands of people rallied to demand new presidential elections and the release of jailed opposition politicians. Mr Maduro accused the opposition of attacking police. Opposition groups had called on their supporters to take part in anti-government protests across the country on Wednesday. In the capital, Caracas, tens of thousands marched towards the Ombudsman's office from different points in the city. Some of the marches turned violent, with protesters throwing stones and members of the security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Tens of thousands of government supporters also gathered for a rival rally in Caracas at which President Maduro spoke.  Seventeen-year-old Carlos José Moreno was killed by a shot in the head in the centre of Caracas near an opposition demonstration.  His brother said the teenager had not been attending the protest but was on his way to play football when he came across an opposition march and was shot dead. Witnesses told Agence France Press news agency that the shots were fired by men on motorbikes, who also threw tear gas at the opposition march. A 23-year-old student, Paola Ramírez, was shot dead in the city of San Cristobal, in western Venezuela.  Her boyfriend told Reuters news agency that they were chased by armed men on motorbikes as they were leaving an anti-government protest in the city, also on a motorbike. Ms Ramírez was shot dead shortly afterwards at a square where she had been looking for her sister, her boyfriend said.  A member of the National Guard, Sergeant Niumar Sanclemente, was shot dead in Miranda state, ombudsman Tarek Saab tweeted. He said that Sgt Sanclemente had been killed by a ""sharpshooter"" during an anti-government protest, where a National Guard colonel was also injured. He did not give further details about who the sharpshooter may have been.  Witnesses in the killings of Mr Moreno and Ms Ramírez said that the shooters belonged to ""colectivos"", pro-government militant grassroots groups. Members of the colectivos argue that they are defending President Maduro's socialist revolution from attacks from elitist and imperialist sectors of society. But critics say their most hardline members are little more than thugs who intimidate anyone who thinks differently. Vice-President Tareck El Aissami said opposition leaders who had called for the protests were to blame for the killings, in particular the president of the opposition-led National Assembly, Julio Borges. ""The person responsible [for the killings] is Julio Borges, as he has repeatedly spread his message of violence, hate and intolerance,"" Mr El Aissami said. ""He pushed one group of Venezuelans to confront another group of our countrymen."" Ombudsman Saab called for an investigation into all of the killings.  More than 50 people are reported to have been injured in the protests across Venezuela. There were reports of shops being looted in western Caracas and more than 500 people were arrested according to figures compiled by a non-governmental group Foro Penal.  A pro-government rally in Caracas was attended by tens of thousands of people who cheered President Maduro and the deputy leader of the socialist PSUV party, Diosdado Cabello.  Mr Cabello praised the people who had come out to ""defend the Bolivarian Revolution"". In a sign of heightening tension between the government and private enterprise, US car giant General Motors said that its Venezuelan plant in the city of Valencia had been ""unexpectedly taken by the public authorities"". They have four key demands: Opposition leader Henrique Capriles has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets again on Thursday, He said that ""millions"" had protested on Wednesday and urged them to keep up the pressure on the government.  Opposition leaders want fresh elections to be held as they think the government is to blame for Venezuela's high inflation, rampant crime and shortages of basic goods. The government and its supporters blame imperialist forces led by the United States for the dismal state of the economy and say they are victims of an ""economic war"" being waged against them.  They have vowed to ""defend the Bolivarian Revolution"". As previous attempts at dialogue between the government and the opposition have failed it is hard to see fresh negotiations starting anytime soon. The National Electoral Council could try to defuse the situation by setting a date for regional elections, which had originally been expected to be held last December. But for the immediate future, belligerent rhetoric and protests are likely to continue.",Thursday 20 April 2017,20-Apr-17,Two shot dead at Venezuela protests,"The incidents came as thousands took part in the ""mother of all protests"" against President Maduro.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39645809
"North Korea: Pentagon addresses confusion over strike group US defence chiefs have been clarifying the whereabouts of warships that President Trump erroneously suggested last week were sailing for North Korea. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said the USS Carl Vinson strike group is now proceeding to the Western Pacific. The ship is part of what President Trump said last week was an ""armada"" being deployed off North Korea amid tensions over its nuclear plans. But the vessels were heading the other way for training with Australia's navy. South Korean media were incredulous, with one newspaper headline blaring, ""Trump's Carl Vinson lie"". Joongang Daily likened the controversy to alleged ""fake missiles"" paraded through North Korea's capital. Seeking to clear up confusion on Wednesday, the Pentagon chief said he wanted ""to be open about what we're doing"". Speaking in Saudi Arabia, Mr Mattis said: ""We're doing exactly what we said we're going to do. She will be on her way.  ""And I'll determine when she gets there and where she actually operates - but the Vinson is going to be part of our ensuring that we stand by our allies in the north-west Pacific."" The confusion began on 9 April when the US Navy said the Carl Vinson strike group was travelling from Singapore to the Western Pacific. Two days later, President Trump said in an interview with Fox Business: ""We are sending an armada, very powerful"" towards the Korean peninsula.  His remark stoked fears across East Asia that the US was poised for a pre-emptive military strike. But rather than heading north to the Sea of Japan, on 13 April the Vinson was travelling in the opposite direction, south towards Australia, for a scheduled weekend exercise with that country's navy. A US Navy photo dated 15 April showed the Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier heading through the Sunda Strait into the Indian Ocean. The Vinson battle group is not expected to reach the Korean peninsula until next week. Questioned on Wednesday at the daily White House briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer insisted the administration did not mislead anyone. ""The president said we have an armada that's going toward the peninsula,"" Mr Spicer told reporters. ""That's a fact, it happened. It is happening, rather."" The BBC's Korea correspondent, Stephen Evans, says it is not clear whether the mix-up was a deliberate deception, perhaps designed to frighten North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, a change of plan or simple miscommunication. But some questioned why the timeline was not corrected earlier given the tensions involving nuclear-armed North Korea. On Tuesday, the Pentagon's chief spokeswoman, Dana White, conceded: ""This should have been communicated more clearly at the time."" Some Chinese have taken to social media to tease the US. ""American imperialism is a paper tiger,"" said one user on Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

"Serena Williams: World number two's pregnancy is confirmed   Serena Williams, the most successful female player of the Open era, is pregnant - just 12 weeks after winning a record 23rd Grand Slam singles title. The American, 35, is due to give birth in the autumn, says her representative.  The world number two posted a picture on social media app Snapchat, posing in a mirror with the message: ""20 weeks"", before deleting it. If accurate, that would mean Williams was around eight weeks pregnant while winning in Melbourne. Williams will miss the rest of the season, having not played since the Australian Open, citing a knee injury.  Williams, who will return to world number one next week, would be eligible to retain her ranking under the WTA special ranking rule if she is ready to play her first tournament within 12 months of giving birth. Former world number one Victoria Azarenka gave birth to her first child in December and is expected to return to competition at the end of July. Belgium's Kim Clijsters, meanwhile, won the US Open in 2009 just 18 months after giving birth to her daughter. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller: The news would suggest that Serena won the Australian Open while roughly eight weeks into her pregnancy. We are very unlikely to see her compete in another Grand Slam before the French Open of 2018. That event will take place four months before her 37th birthday - but do not write off a woman who will return to world number one on Monday. Azarenka is a useful guide. Even though she is eight years younger, the Belarusian returned to serious training in March after giving birth in December and is targeting the WTA event in Stanford at the end of July for her return. US Open Tennis responded to Williams' message by saying: ""Serena Williams will have a new pride and joy to hug and call her own soon! Congratulations on the exciting baby announcement!"" Sorry, this content is no longer available. Williams, who announced her engagement to the co-founder of community news and chat site Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, in December, is top of the all-time list of major winners since Grand Slams accepted professional players in 1968. She is second only to Australian Margaret Court on the list of women's all-time Grand Slam singles titles leaders - Court won 24 titles between 1960 and 1973. Court, who won the singles Grand Slam in 1970, gave birth to her first child in March 1972, aged 29, and returned to win three of the four Grand Slam events in 1973.

"MS-13 gang: The story behind one of the world's most brutal street gangs A string of brutal murders in the US has thrown a national spotlight on MS-13, a street gang that was born in LA but has roots in El Salvador. The latest was a mass murder on Monday on Long Island, where the bodies of four males, including three teenagers, were found mangled in the woods, according to police. President Trump tweeted to call the gang ""bad"". Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to ""devastate"" it. Both blamed Obama-era immigration policy for its rise. But what is MS-13 and is Obama really to blame? The gang began in the barrios of Los Angeles in LA during the 1980s, formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's long and brutal civil war. Other members came from Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. The MS stands for Mara Salvatrucha, said to be a combination of Mara, meaning gang, Salva, for Salvador, and trucha, which translates roughly into street smarts. The 13 represents the position of M in the alphabet. MS-13 established a reputation for extreme violence and for killing with machetes. It took root in neighbourhoods dominated by Mexican gangs, and later expanded to other parts of the country.  According to the FBI, the gang has spread to 46 states.  In 2012, the US Treasury designated the gang a ""transnational criminal organisation"". It was the first street gang to receive the dubious honour, placing it alongside much larger international cartels like the Mexican Zetas, Japanese Yakuza and Italian Camorra. MS-13 has been accused of recruiting poor and at-risk teenagers. Joining is said to require being ""jumped in"" - subjected to a vicious 13-second beating - and ""getting wet"" - carrying out a crime, often a murder, for the gang. Leaving is potentially even more dangerous. Large chest tattoos brand members for life, and some factions are said to murder members who attempt to leave. A 2008 FBI threat assessment put the size of MS-13 between 6,000 and 10,000 members in the US, making it one of the largest criminal enterprises in the country. It is now larger outside the country, according to the agency. An anti-gang crackdown in the late 1990s saw hundreds of early members shipped back to Central American countries, where they established offshoots. Estimates put the number of members in Central American countries at at least 60,000. The gang's annual revenue is about $31.2m (£23.4m) according to information from a large-scale Salvadorean police operation obtained by the El Faro newspaper - mainly from from drugs and extortion. Recent high-profile cases linked to the gang include the murder of two female high-school students who were attacked with a machete and baseball bat as they walked through their neighbourhood in New York last month - a revenge attack over a minor dispute, according to police. Four alleged MS-13 members were charged with that crime. Another two alleged members were charged at the same time with the murder of a fellow gang member said to have violated gang protocol. The same month, two alleged members of the gang in Houston, Texas were charged with kidnapping three teenage girls, holding them hostage and raping them before shooting one dead on the side of the road. Miguel Alvarez-Flores, 22, and Diego Hernandez-Rivera, 18, laughed and waved at the cameras during their court appearance. MS-13's motto is ""kill, rape, control"", according to one FBI gang specialist who investigated the group.  Mr Trump and Mr Sessions have pointed the finger at former President Barack Obama over the spread of MS-13, alleging that his open-door immigration policies fuelled its growth. But the gang formed and flourished in the US long before Mr Obama came to power. MS-13 was identified as a significant threat in the 1990s, and a special FBI taskforce was convened against the gang in 1994. ""The big surge was during Bush-Cheney when the drivers of illegal migration in Central America grew, when various crackdowns on crime filled prisons to bursting point, and when funding for rehabilitation programs declined,"" Fulton T Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, told fact-checking website Politifact.  ""I have seen no evidence that the Obama administration can be blamed in any way for the existence or activities of the gang in the US,"" said Ioan Grillo, author of a book on US gang crime. The Obama administration also prioritised the deportation of gang criminals, including MS-13 members, in an aggressive deportation program. Politifact rated Mr Trump's claim as false.

"Canada hits back in dairy dispute with the US Canada is pushing back over US President Donald Trump's criticism that its protectionist dairy policies are hurting US farmers.  Mr Trump targeted Canada's dairy sector as ""unfair"" in a recent speech in Wisconsin.  Dozens of the state's dairy farms face being dropped by their milk buyer after new Canadian pricing put a dent in US milk protein exports. Canada's ambassador says that Canada is being unfairly maligned. ""Canada does not accept the contention that Canada's dairy policies are the cause of financial loss for dairy farmers in the United States,"" Canada's envoy to Washington, David MacNaughton, said in a letter to the governors of New York and Wisconsin. ""The facts do not bear this out."" Mr MacNaughton instead laid the blame at the feet of ""US and global overproduction"" and the difficult ""global situation"" of low world dairy prices, which is a problem faced by farmers on both sides of the border.  The ambassador also noted that the current dairy trade balance favours the US five to one - a point he underscored again during a news conference on Wednesday.  Canada protects its dairy sector by putting high tariffs on imported products in order to keep prices high for its farmers.  This has been a source of irritation for other dairy-producing countries.  Lawmakers from dairy producing states like Wisconsin and New York, as well as American dairy organisations, have been lobbying the president for months to take on the Canadian dairy industry for practices they say are in violation of trade commitments.  At issue is a new pricing agreement struck last spring by Canada's dairy farmers and processors that industry groups in Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Mexico and the United States say would price domestic milk ingredients, used for making cheese and yoghurt, below cost.  American groups say that agreement means US exports of these high-protein milk products are being elbowed out of the Canadian market for a domestic supply, costing US farm jobs.  Canada's cheesemakers have been importing a growing amount of what is called ""diafiltered milk"" or ""ultra-filtered milk"", a commodity that can cross the border tariff-free unlike other dairy products.  Those exports increased from US$33m (£25m) in 2011 to US$98m (£76m)in 2016.  The US dairy industry says that agreement led to Wisconsin and New York companies losing millions of dollars in ultra-filtered milk exports due to a drop in demand for the ingredients from Canada.  This is not the first time Canada's dairy industry has been criticised for being overly protectionist.  Ottawa operates a supply-managed system that tightly controls production and imports to support prices. Canada has also fiercely protected its dairy industry in recent trade deals, from the Trans-Pacific Partnership to Ceta, the Canada-European Union deal.  On Wednesday,  Australia and New Zealand dairy industry leaders said they would support any moves by Washington to draw the World Trade Organization into a trade dispute with Canada.  University of Toronto political scientist Grace Skogstad says that while the Canadian dairy sector is ""vulnerable"" to external trade pressures, it has weathered disputes before, including under the North American Free Trade Agreement.  ""This has been an issue for a very long time, Trump or no Trump,"" she said.

"North Korea tension: China 'seriously concerned' about nuclear threats China says it is seriously concerned about North Korean nuclear development, in the wake of a BBC interview with a top official from the North. North Korea's vice-foreign minister told the BBC Pyongyang would continue to test missiles and would launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike if it thought the US was planning an attack. Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China opposed words or actions that could further raise tension. North Korea-US tension is growing. There has been heated rhetoric from both sides in recent days. US Vice-President Mike Pence, who has been visiting the region, warned the North not to test Washington and said the US ""era of strategic patience"" with Pyongyang was over. The BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing says the Chinese government appears to be becoming increasingly frustrated with North Korea, its traditional ally. ""I have noted the recent report,"" Mr Lu said, referring to the BBC interview. ""China expresses serious concern with recent trends about North Korea's nuclear and missile development.  ""China is unswerving in its commitment to realising the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, maintaining the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula, and continue to solve matters through dialogue and negotiations."" Mr Lu added that tension was already high in the region before the latest comments from Pyongyang. The North held a show of military might in a parade over the weekend and tested another missile on Sunday, which the Pentagon said blew up almost immediately after launch. Pyongyang said it may test missiles on a weekly basis, and warned of ""all-out war"" if the US takes military action. ""If the US is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method,"" Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the BBC on Monday. Later Mr Pence vowed to ""defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response"". The US Navy's Carl Vinson strike group - consisting of an aircraft carrier and other warships - is on its way to the Western Pacific, Pacific Command said on Tuesday, following an order from President Donald Trump last week. It has emerged that when the original announcement of the group's movement was made it was travelling in the opposite direction.

"Canadian woman faces human smuggling charges A Saskatchewan woman has been charged with human smuggling following a months-long cross-border investigation.  Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested and charged Michelle Omoruyi, 43, as part of an investigation into asylum seekers crossing illegally into Canada.  She was stopped after crossing at the Saskatchewan border in a vehicle carrying nine foreign nationals.  Those nine people from West Africa have since made refugee claims in Canada.  Canadian police said on Wednesday they seized evidence and ""a significant amount of cash"" from a Regina home searched after Ms Omoruyi's arrest on 14 April.  The arrests are part of an ongoing joint four-month investigation by Canada and US authorities into organised human smuggling.  Jason Evert, with the Canada Border Services Agency, said during a news conference on Wednesday that investigators uncovered evidence suggesting human smugglers were facilitating illegal border crossings in the area.  United States Border Patrol also made three arrests in North Dakota near the boundary on Friday in relation to this investigation Two of the individuals arrested were Canadian citizens. The third was Nigerian.  A growing number of asylum seekers have been crossing illegally into Canada from the US in recent months, mostly into the provinces of Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia.  The trend continued in March, with 887 people caught border-jumping last month, up from 658 in February.  Public Safety Canada warned in a statement that came with the latest border crossing figures that ""trying to slip across the border in an irregular manner is not a 'free' ticket to Canada"", noting asylum seekers would be processed and their claims adjudicated through due process.  Ms Omoruyi, from Regina, faces a charge of human smuggling and a charge of conspiracy to commit human smuggling.  She is scheduled to appear in provincial court on 15 May.

"Emirates to cut US flights after Trump travel restrictions Emirates will reduce flights to five US cities from next month, after new security rules targeted travellers from the Middle East. The Dubai-based airline said the change was due to weaker demand for US travel.  In March, the US banned electronic devices larger than a mobile phone from cabin luggage on flights from 10 airports. This included Dubai, as well as from other airports in the Middle East, north Africa and Turkey.  The UK imposed similar rules to the US. US President Donald Trump has also signed two executive orders to bar refugees and nationals of several Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and north Africa from travelling to the US. Those bans have been contested in court. An Emirates spokeswoman said: ""The recent actions taken by the US government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the US. ""Over the past three months, we have seen a significant deterioration in the booking profiles on all our US routes, across all travel segments."" Emirates president Tim Clark said last month that demand to the US had fallen by about a third since Mr Trump's announcements.  The airline has also introduced new services to cope with the laptop ban, lending tablets to premium passengers and offering to check in electronics at the gate. Emirates said it will reduce direct flights to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando to five a week in May from the present one a day.  The airline will also cut back its twice-daily flights to Seattle and Boston in June to one a day, with a similar frequency for Los Angeles from July. However Etihad, its smaller Abu Dhabi-based rival, said it had not seen a significant change in demand for travel to the US in recent weeks. The airline flies to six US cities. Emirates started flying to North America in 2004. It now serves 12 US destinations, launching its most recent route, between Athens and Newark, last month. Its expansion has led to conflict with US airlines, which have accused the group of receiving government subsidies.",Thursday 20 April 2017,20-Apr-17,Emirates plans to cut back US flights,Cutbacks come after President Donald Trump's controversial travel bans target Middle East.,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39640473
"Fox News: Bill O'Reilly out after harassment claims Presenter Bill O'Reilly has been dropped from Fox News over sexual harassment claims, the company says. ""After a thorough and careful review of the allegations... Bill O'Reilly will not be returning,"" the network said in a one-sentence statement. He has been on holiday since 12 April, and was seen shaking hands with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Wednesday. O'Reilly said it was ""tremendously disheartening"" to leave over ""completely unfounded claims"". More than 50 sponsors have withdrawn ads from his show, The O'Reilly Factor. Pressure on Fox has mounted since recent reports that five women had received $13m (£10m) in payouts because of O'Reilly's behaviour. The prime-time presenter, who has been with the US network almost since its inception, has denied all of the allegations. ""It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,"" he said in a statement released after his dismissal. ""But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today."" Fox broadcaster Tucker Carlson will be taking over Mr O'Reilly's slot, the company said in a follow-up statement. Trump defends Fox host amid sex claims In an internal memo sent to 21st Century Fox employees, the company wrote that the decision had been made after ""extensive review done in collaboration with outside counsel"". The letter - signed by Rupert Murdoch and his sons Lachlan and James - praised Mr O'Reilly as ""one of the the most accomplished TV personalities in the history of cable news"". It added that the network was committed to ""fostering a work environment built on the values of trust and respect"". Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington  The sexual harassment charges against Bill O'Reilly aren't new. They've bubbled up before and have been quietly ushered from view, thanks to multimillion-dollar legal settlements. Now, however, they have brought down the top-rated conservative talk show on cable news.  So what changed? Was it lurid details of his alleged behaviour? The protests? Commercial sponsors abandoning his show? The impact the scandal could have on 21st Century Fox's attempts to purchase European broadcaster Sky? All probably contributed to O'Reilly's exit. The crack in the proverbial dam, however, came when Fox News head Roger Ailes was sacked for his own sexual harassment scandal.  If Mr Ailes, who built the conservative television empire, could be laid low by his tawdry behaviour, no one was untouchable - even Mr O'Reilly. Welcome to Fox News in the Donald Trump era. Mr Ailes is out. Mr O'Reilly is gone.  Presenter Megyn Kelly has bolted to NBC. The only giant left standing is Trump super-fan Sean Hannity.  A network that defined itself by blanket opposition to Barack Obama now appears adrift, challenged by more aggressive conservative media outlets and toxic to the left.  It's a tricky position to occupy - a victim of its own success… and hubris. The O'Reilly Factor drew nearly four million viewers per night. The most recent allegation came on Tuesday evening when lawyer for a former African-American clerical worker at Fox alleged her client had been harassed by Mr O'Reilly in 2008. Lawyer Lisa Bloom said the Fox News host had referred to the unidentified woman as ""hot chocolate"". ""He would leer at her,"" said Ms Bloom. ""He would always do this when no-one else was around, and she was scared.""  Media-watchers say the allegations had become too much of a liability for 21st Century Fox. A concern for the Murdoch family is their pending $14bn (£11bn) deal to buy out satellite provider Sky, which is being scrutinised by British regulators. Earlier this month authorities with the European Commission cleared 21st Century Fox to acquire the remaining 61% of Sky that it does not yet own. Sources at the company tell US media that Rupert Murdoch was in favour of keeping Mr O'Reilly in his post. But James Murdoch, chief executive officer of 21st Century Fox, reportedly argued that Mr O'Reilly should go. The company reputation has taken a hit after sexual harassment allegations were also levelled at Roger Ailes, the former head of Fox News. Mr Ailes resigned in 2016 after being sued by a former Fox News presenter, Gretchen Carlson.",Thursday 20 April 2017,20-Apr-17,Fox dumps O'Reilly amid harassment claims,Fox News presenter Bill O'Reilly loses job over allegations of sexual harassment of female colleagues.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39647434
"'Gibraltar-sized' space rock passes Earth A large asteroid the size of the Rock of Gibraltar has passed safely by Earth. The object, measured to be almost a kilometre wide, came within five times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Known as 2014 JO25, the asteroid is the biggest such space rock to skim our world since 2004. Astronomers say the best opportunity to view the rock will come in the dark hours of Wednesday night. Radar imagery using Nasa's 70m (230 ft) antenna at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California reveal a peanut-shaped asteroid that rotates about once every five hours. The asteroid passed Earth at a distance of 1.8 million km (1.1 million miles) at 13:24 BST on Wednesday, 19 April. The next known encounter of an asteroid of about this size will occur in 2027 when the 800m-wide (half-mile-wide) asteroid 1999 AN10 will fly by at one lunar distance, about 380,000 km (236,000 miles).",Thursday 20 April 2017,20-Apr-17,'Gibraltar' space rock passes Earth,A large asteroid the size of the Rock of Gibraltar has passed safely by Earth.,http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39642995
"Policeman and suspected gunman shot dead in Paris 'terror attack' One policeman has been shot dead and two others wounded in central Paris, French police say, with their suspected attacker killed by security forces. A lone gunman opened fire before being killed as he fled the scene, police say. The Champs-Elysees was sealed off.  President Francois Hollande said that he was convinced the attack was ""terrorist-related"". So-called Islamic State (IS) said that one of its ""fighters"" had carried out the attack. Islamist militancy is a major issue in the polls after recent mass attacks claimed by IS, with 238 people killed in jihadist attacks in France since 2015, according to data from AFP news agency. Several candidates in Sunday's presidential election have ended their campaigns early as a mark of respect, with the centre-right's François Fillon calling on others to halt theirs too.   ""On the face of it, the officers were deliberately targeted,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said. Mr Hollande said after crisis talks with his prime minister and interior minister that the security forces had the full support of the nation and a national tribute would be paid to the fallen policeman. He said he would hold a meeting of his security cabinet on Friday morning. Because of its worldwide renown and its large number of visitors, the Champs-Elysees has long been seen as a potential target, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from the French capital. A car pulled up alongside a police bus just before 21:00 (19:00 GMT) and a man got out, opening fire with an automatic weapon at the bus, Mr Brandet said. After killing an officer, he attempted to run away while shooting at other officers, two of whom he injured, the spokesman added. He was then shot dead by security forces. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins later said that ""the attacker's identity is known and has been verified"". ""I won't reveal it, because investigations and raids are already under way, in particular to establish whether there is any evidence or not of complicity (in this attack)."" Meanwhile, IS identified the attacker as Abu-Yusuf al-Baljiki, in a statement carried by its Amaq news outlet. The whole of the Champs-Elysees was evacuated and police vehicles were lined up near a point half way up the avenue around the George V metro station, our correspondent says. Shots were heard near the Marks & Spencer store, provoking  a panicked rush away from the scene by tourists and passers-by.  Witnesses interviewed by AFP recounted scenes of panic as people ran for cover and sought shelter. ""We had to hide our customers in the basement,"" said Choukri Chouanine, manager of a restaurant near the site of the shooting. Thousands of troops and police guard tourist areas of the French capital. In February, a man armed with a machete in each hand was wounded after attacking soldiers on patrol at the Louvre Museum.  The following month, a 39-year-old man was killed at Orly airport after attacking a soldier. The 11 candidates standing in Sunday's closely fought election were engaged in a final joint TV appearance to make their pitches as the attack happened. Marine Le Pen, of the far-right national Front, tweeted:""I feel for and stand by our security forces, who have been targeted again."" Mr Fillon went on Twitter to pay ""tribute to the security forces who give their lives to protect ours"". Both Ms Le Pen and Mr Fillon later announced they were cancelling campaign events scheduled for Friday, the last day of canvassing for votes. Independent centrist Emmanuel Macron said during his TV appearance that it was a president's ""first duty to protect"" and he expressed his ""solidarity"" with the police. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, standing for the far left, tweeted: ""I strongly feel for the policemen killed and wounded and their families. Terrorist attacks will never go unpunished, accomplices never forgotten."" French candidates in last TV pitch ahead of vote At the White House, US President Donald Trump said people had to be strong and vigilant.

"Arkansas executes Ledell Lee in first death penalty use in 12 years Arkansas has executed Ledell Lee in the US state's first use of the death penalty in 12 years. It came after the US Supreme Court rejected a challenge arguing Arkansas was unfairly rushing several executions before its supply of a lethal injection drug expires at the end of April. On Thursday the state's Supreme Court overturned a ruling blocking the use of a different drug. Lee was convicted of murder and recently told the BBC he was innocent. Arkansas plans to carry out two more executions on Monday, and one next Thursday. He was pronounced dead at 23:56 local time on Thursday (04:56 GMT on Friday) at the state's death chamber in its Cummins Unit prison, a Department of Corrections spokesman said. His death warrant was due to expire at midnight. Lee did not make a final statement. Instead of a last meal, he asked to receive communion, an official said, adding that he was given grape juice or water rather than sacramental wine.  Lee did not appear to suffer as the drugs took effect, according to a reporter selected to serve as a media witness. Analysis: Aleem Maqbool, BBC News It could barely have been a more tortuous few days for the family of Ledell Lee.  As well as speaking to him by phone, I met his mother Stella last week; a strong woman, mistrustful of officials (and of reporters), who insisted she knew her son to be innocent with every bone in her body.   Since then, she had hopes raised when it looked like a pharmaceutical company would win its battle to stop its drug being used to kill; or when a court ruled there was too much risk of extreme suffering for the lethal injection drug to be used; or when human rights groups filed petitions arguing Ledell had not had a fair murder trial as some observers have noted for years.   The legal battles were still going on even hours after her son had declined his 'last meal' and instead received communion.   At almost the last possible moment, the final legal obstacle was brushed aside and Ledell Lee was put to death.  One victim's relative, in the case of another prisoner due to be executed this month, said the prisoners' families had the luxury of being able to say a proper goodbye in a way that he never did.  But it has been hard to imagine what a mother must feel knowing her son is set to die at a certain time on a certain date. He had been on death row for more than 20 years after he was convicted of beating Debra Reese to death with a tyre thumper in 1993. He was arrested less than an hour after the killing when he had spent some of the money he had stolen from his victim. Her family ""had waited 24 years to see justice done"", Arkansas Attorney General Deborah Rutledge said in a statement. ""I pray this lawful execution helps bring closure for the Reese family,"" she said. Lee told the BBC's Aleem Maqbool in a recent interview that he was innocent, and death row was like a ""living nightmare"". Crowds that had gathered to protest outside the Arkansas governor's mansion in Little Rock chanted and and held hands until Lee was pronounced dead just before midnight, and only four minutes before his death warrant had been due to expire. The state had initially planned to carry out eight executions in 11 days, before the 30 April expiration date of its supply of the drug, midazolam - used together in lethal injections with two other drugs. The first three executions were cancelled due to various court rulings. Arkansas plans to put to death three more men before the end of the month. Lee's lawyer, Nina Morrison, denounced the state's timeline, saying it ""denied him the opportunity to conduct DNA testing that could have proven his innocence"". ""While reasonable people can disagree on whether death is an appropriate form of punishment, no one should be executed when there is a possibility that person is innocent,"" she said in a statement. The other inmate due to die on Thursday has been given a stay to make time for advanced DNA testing that his lawyers say could prove his innocence. Stacey Johnson was convicted of the murder of Carol Heath, who was beaten and had her throat slit in her flat in 1993. Thursday saw a flurry of legal activity, with the new Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch siding with conservatives in the 5-4 decision to reject the inmates' claim that the accelerated process amounted to ""cruel and unusual punishment"". It followed Arkansas's Supreme Court's overturning of a ruling by a lower court that blocked the use of the drug vecuronium bromide. The McKesson Corporation, which supplied the drug, had accused the Arkansas Department of Correction of failing to say it planned to use the drug for executions. Like many US states, Arkansas has struggled to find the drugs it needs to carry out executions. Its last was in 2005.

"US fugitive teacher found with student after month on run A Tennessee teacher accused of abducting his 15-year-old student has been captured thousands of miles away. Tad Cummins was arrested in northern California, more than a month after disappearing with his science student. The pair, missing for a month, were found in a cabin near the remote Shasta-Trinity National Forest, the Siskiyou County sheriff announced. Mr Cummins told arresting officers, ""I'm glad it's over"", Sgt Mike Gilley told reporters after the arrest. He was arrested after the cabin caretaker owner worked with authorities to lay a trap for him, Mr Gilley said. A lawyer for the girl's family said: ""There aren't words in the English language to describe the level of relief and elation experienced by the Thomas family."" Jason Whatley added: ""Now begins another hard chapter, but for now, we celebrate.""  The girl has not yet spoken to her family due to her location being too remote, he said, and police officers were forced to trek through snow to capture him. The 50-year-old had been Elizabeth's teacher at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, Tennessee. Tennessee officials said that he ""may have been abusing his role as a teacher to groom this vulnerable young girl for some time in an effort to lure and potentially sexually exploit her"". The two disappeared on 13 March, weeks after a student reported seeing them kissing inside a classroom. Shortly afterwards, they were spotted on surveillance cameras at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, but they had not been seen since. Mr Cummins was suspended in February from teaching after failing to adhere to school administrators orders to stay away from the teenager.  Authorities say that before disappearing, Mr Cummins had carried out online research on ""teen marriage"". He also purchased hair dye, took out a $4,500 (£3,600) personal loan, and researched if his Nissan Rogue vehicle could be tracked, officials say. Police had considered Mr Cummins armed and dangerous during the manhunt. According to a legal petition filed in court by the girl's family earlier this month, Mr Cummins is a ""masterfully manipulating predator"" who forced Elizabeth to go out with him by threatening her with repercussions at school. According to the court papers, Mr Cummins - who had been married for 31 years - would visit the girl at home to pick her up for meals, as well as come to the fast food restaurant where she worked. ""The child had told various siblings and/or friends that she was scared of Cummins and felt in over her head,"" the documents show. Jill Cummins, the suspect's wife, filed for divorce as officials closed in on her husband. ""It's very selfish of him to have done this to us,"" she told ABC News. ""I do love him, but I don't trust him anymore. He's totally betrayed me,"" she went on to say.

"Aaron Hernandez had 'John 3:16 on forehead' in jail suicide Former NFL footballer Aaron Hernandez was found with a Bible verse scrawled on his forehead after taking his own life, according to local media reports. The former New England Patriots tight end hanged himself in his Massachusetts prison cell on Wednesday and was pronounced dead later at hospital. The 27-year-old reportedly marked the gospel passage ""John 3:16"" in red ink on his forehead.  His death came five days after he was acquitted in a double murder trial. New England Patriots deny Donald Trump snub Hernandez had cried in court as that verdict was read, saying he was ""very happy"", but he was still serving a prison sentence for another murder. According to local media reports, Hernandez wrote the popular Bible verse on his forehead. It refers to the phrase: ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" Massachusetts authorities later revealed three handwritten notes were also found next to a Bible in Hernandez's prison cell, though they did not disclose the content of the messages. Does the NFL have a crime problem? Hernandez - who had ""God forgives"" tattooed on his arm - had not been considered at risk of suicide, Mr Fallon added. Massachusetts prisons have twice as many inmate suicides as the national average, federal data shows.  The state had an annual suicide rate of 32 per 100,000 prisoners from 2001-14, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Only Rhode Island, Utah and Montana had higher rates. Jose Baez, Hernandez's attorney, said the state medical examiner's office is ""illegally"" withholding the football star's brain despite family wishes to donate it to research.  Mr Baez told reporters on Thursday the family wants to donate the brain to Boston University's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center, which studies the progressive degenerative disease that is found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The disease, which can only be diagnosed after death, has been found in the brains of dozens of former American football players. Mr Baez expressed concern that any delay in releasing the brain to BU would compromise the study of it.  The medical examiner's office did not immediately comment after the news conference. Hernandez was cleared last week of the murders of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were shot dead outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.  But he was found guilty of illegally possessing a firearm and the judge added five years to his sentence. Hernandez had been found guilty in April 2015 of the first-degree murder of his friend, another American footballer, the semi-professional Odin Lloyd, in 2013. Lloyd's body was found with six bullet wounds less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Within hours of his arrest for the 2013 shooting, the Patriots sacked Hernandez, considered one of the top tight ends playing the game. Hernandez was given a life sentence without parole.

"A third of US millennials still live at home, census report finds This may not surprise anyone aged 18-34 but according to US Census data, if you're in that age bracket, your life differs wildly from your parents.  Gone are the steady jobs and home ownership of yore.  Gone too is married life - more 18-34 year-olds live with their parents than with a spouse. The US Census Bureau report found that the extent to which young people reached milestones like living alone was ""tied to economic security"". But some of their expectations of what it means to be an adult have changed. In these hard economic times, then, about a third of millennials still live at home with their parents.  Last year, research found it was the most common living arrangement for young adults - for the first time in 130 years. There are 24 million 18-34-year-olds, among whom there are more men than women. And of them, 2.2. million are not studying or working. Some of those who stay at home have disabilities or poor health, but it seems many are just priced out of moving out. Weirdly, though, this study counts college dorms as being ""at home"". Maybe because they think it's parents who pay for that? The study compared the 18-34 year old age group with young adults in 1975, their parents' generation. So what's changed between then and now? A few things: Back then, eight in 10 people were married by 30. Now, young people wait longer. By the age of 45, eight in 10 are married too. Maybe it's because they don't see family as a marker of adulthood in the way their parents might have done; more than half of young Americans today say marrying and having children are not very important for becoming an adult. The state where young people were most likely to be living in their own household was North Dakota, where 60% of young people were living alone or with a partner or spouse. Millennials these days believe in getting a good education. More than 60% said finishing school was very important for becoming an adult. More women work outside the home nowadays - it's one of the biggest changes highlighted in the report. Only 14% of 25-34 year-old women are homemakers now, compared to 43% in 1975.  This change drove an overall boost; young people today are more likely to be employed year-round than their parents were at the same age. Only a quarter of men had low incomes in 1975 (annual salaries of less than $30,000 - £23,500 - in 2015 money). But by 2015, that had risen to 41%. The study's authors said men were ""falling behind"" and, compared to 1975, were ""more likely to be absent from the work force and a far higher share today are at the bottom of the income ladder. It's worth bearing in mind though, that young men's median income is still $11,000 (£8,500) a year higher than women's. Good question. This study says it counts ""people born between 1982 and 1998, which roughly corresponds to the millennial generation"".

"Trump-targeted judge gets high-profile immigration case A US judge labelled ""Mexican"" by President Donald Trump last year is to hear a high-profile deportation case. Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Mr Trump also called a ""hater"", was apparently assigned to the lawsuit randomly.  The case involves Juan Manuel Montes, who says he was deported from California in February, though he has lived in the US since he was a child. But US immigration officials say the 23-year-old voluntarily left the US for Mexico. The lawsuit has been seized upon by immigration advocates and critics of the president as proof that his administration is arbitrarily deporting US residents. Lawyers for Mr Montes, who lived in the US since he was nine years old, say he was deported on 17 February after he was stopped in the border city of Calexico, California, by Border Patrol officials. He said he had left his wallet and identification in a friend's car. The plaintiff says he made clear he was protected from deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), an Obama-era programme allowing immigrants brought illegally to the US as children to stay. But Mr Montes - who has a cognitive disability from a brain injury - says he was deported to Mexico anyway. However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says it has no record of Mr Montes being deported on 17 February. The DHS says it does have a record, however, of arresting Mr Montes on 19 February after he climbed a border fence to try to get back into the US from Mexico. He was sent back. Mr Montes and his lawyers concede he did climb over the border fence, but only because he had been unfairly deported in the first place.  The case hinges on whether the 17 February encounter alleged by Mr Montes ever happened. If not, then he was not protected under Daca, because he would have left the US without permission and then tried to re-enter illegally. The DHS has already corrected one detail of its records - the department originally said Mr Montes' Daca enrolment had expired in 2015, but it acknowledged on Wednesday that his status was valid until 2018. However, the agency also said Mr Montes had ""lost his Daca status when he left the United States without [permission from immigration authorities] on an unknown date prior to his arrest"" by Border Patrol on 19 February. Activists have seized on the case to argue that the Trump administration is going back on its word not to deport more than 750,000 immigrants awarded Daca status.  They say Mr Montes may be the first ""Dreamer"", as Daca enrolees are known, deported under Mr Trump's presidency. US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel presided last year over a lawsuit involving students who claimed fraud after paying to attend real estate seminars branded as Trump University. During the lawsuit, Mr Trump said Judge Curiel's ""Mexican heritage"" meant that he would not rule fairly in the case, because Mr Trump wanted to build a border wall between the US and Mexico.  Mr Trump was condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike for his attacks on the jurist, who was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. Judge Curiel later approved a $25m (£23.3m) settlement in the case, under the terms of which Mr Trump did not admit any wrongdoing.  His assignment to the Montes case is said to be purely coincidental, based on rules for the Southern District of California, which selects judges on a rotating schedule. Judge Curiel will be asked to decide whether US Customs and Border Protection should release information on Mr Montes' deportation to his lawyers.

"Venezuela state oil company gave cash to Trump inauguration Venezuela has donated $500,000 to US President Donald Trump's inauguration, newly released records show. Citgo Petroleum, a US-based subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, is named in papers filed with the Federal Election Commission. The revelation comes as the Venezuelan economy appears to be crippled by food shortages, violent crime and inflation. Three people were killed in protests on Wednesday as tens of thousands took to the streets to demand new elections  Other major corporations named in the documents include Pepsi and Walmart, which gave $250,000 and $150,000 respectively, while owners of NFL teams or their companies gave more than $5m. Casino owner and billionaire Sheldon Adelson also gave $5m. Venezuela is in the middle of a major economic crisis, which has the oil-rich country flirting with hyperinflation.  This Wednesday, street protests demanding the resignation of President Nicolas Maduro resulted in at least two persons shot dead.  In this chaotic context, it is perhaps less surprising that Venezuelan media did not seem to dedicate much time to cover the news that their government gave, through a state-owned oil company, a US$500,000 contribution to Donald Trump's inauguration.   Still, some analysts in Venezuela are expressing anger at the news.  ""We have been experiencing four consecutive years of recession, we have the highest inflation in the world and are facing scarcity in many basic goods. It is scandalous that Venezuela, facing such a crisis, would make those donations to the inauguration of a US president, who at least in theory, is ideologically confronted with the revolution,"" Jose Manuel Puente, a professor of public policy at IESA university in Caracas, tells the BBC. The payment was reportedly made through Citgo, a US subsidiary of Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA.

"Berkeley reverses decision to ban Ann Coulter from speaking The University of California, Berkeley, has reversed its decision to cancel an appearance by conservative firebrand Ann Coulter. Her visit was cancelled on Wednesday by administrators citing ""active security threats"", but Republican students said it was an attack on free speech.  UC Berkeley officials later said the speech would be held on 2 May at an ""appropriate, protectable venue"". But she plans to speak on the original date, despite the decision. ""Maybe they will arrest me"", she said in an email to Reuters. The campus Republican group have threatened to sue the university over the change of date. The campus has been the scene of several violent protests in recent months.  Ms Coulter - author of In Trump We Trust - said the school, which gained prominence in the 1960s as the bastion of the so-called Free Speech Movement, had violated her rights. Speaking on Fox News, Ms Coulter urged US Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the matter because she had been ""unconstitutionally banned"" from speaking. She said the university had proposed several rule changes, and she had ""called their bluff"" by agreeing to the conditions. According to the Republican group sponsoring the event, the Young America's Foundation (YAF), the university required Ms Coulter speak in the afternoon, only allow students to attend, and announce the location of the speech close to the time of the event.

"Venezuela state oil company gave cash to Trump inauguration Venezuela has donated $500,000 to US President Donald Trump's inauguration, newly released records show. Citgo Petroleum, a US-based subsidiary of the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, is named in papers filed with the Federal Election Commission. The revelation comes as the Venezuelan economy appears to be crippled by food shortages, violent crime and inflation. Three people were killed in protests on Wednesday as tens of thousands took to the streets to demand new elections  Other major corporations named in the documents include Pepsi and Walmart, which gave $250,000 and $150,000 respectively, while owners of NFL teams or their companies gave more than $5m. Casino owner and billionaire Sheldon Adelson also gave $5m. Venezuela is in the middle of a major economic crisis, which has the oil-rich country flirting with hyperinflation.  This Wednesday, street protests demanding the resignation of President Nicolas Maduro resulted in at least two persons shot dead.  In this chaotic context, it is perhaps less surprising that Venezuelan media did not seem to dedicate much time to cover the news that their government gave, through a state-owned oil company, a US$500,000 contribution to Donald Trump's inauguration.   Still, some analysts in Venezuela are expressing anger at the news.  ""We have been experiencing four consecutive years of recession, we have the highest inflation in the world and are facing scarcity in many basic goods. It is scandalous that Venezuela, facing such a crisis, would make those donations to the inauguration of a US president, who at least in theory, is ideologically confronted with the revolution,"" Jose Manuel Puente, a professor of public policy at IESA university in Caracas, tells the BBC. The payment was reportedly made through Citgo, a US subsidiary of Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA.  It is not the first time Citgo has been involved in politically controversial activities in the US.

"Pavement outside White House shut permanently to public The US Secret Service has announced it has permanently closed access to a sidewalk along the perimeter of the White House. The decision was part of an ""ongoing comprehensive review"" of security measures at the White House and its surrounding grounds, the agency said. It comes one month after a man armed with pepper spray jumped the fence and was inside the grounds for 16 minutes. Two Secret Service agents who were on duty that night were fired.  President Donald Trump was there at the time, but the intruder did not make it into the White House building. The new restriction moves public view on the south side of the White House about 82ft (25 metres) farther back from where people were previously able to stand. Secret Service Communications Director Cathy Milhoan said on Wednesday ""that vantage point... is still there. It's just a few feet further back"". A higher fence has also been approved for the White House, she told WTOP News.  The White House will begin viewing bids later this year, with construction to begin next year. In 2014, a second barricade was erected on the northern side of the building in response to a fence-jumper who was able to run through the doorway of the building while carrying a knife.

"Husband of NY judge found dead in river challenges 'suicide' The husband of US judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, found dead last week in a New York City river, has called reports of her apparent suicide ""unfounded"". The Rev Gregory Jacobs joined police on Wednesday in his first public comments since her death to urge anyone to come forward with details on what happened. The 65-year-old judge was found dead in the Hudson River with no signs of foul play or criminality, police say. But Mr Jacobs dismissed the possibility that she may have taken her own life. ""These reports have frequently included unsubstantiated comments concerning my wife's possible mental and emotional state of mind at the time of her death,"" Mr Jacobs wrote in a statement to NBC News. ""Those of us who loved Sheila and knew her well do not believe that these unfounded conclusions have any basis in reality."" Ms Abdus-Salaam, the first black woman to serve in New York's highest court, was discovered on 12 April, a day after her husband reported her missing. Senior New York judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam found dead in Hudson River Police had reportedly treated the death as a possible suicide, but an initial autopsy last week was inconclusive and the cause of death is still pending, according to Medical Examiner's Office spokeswoman Julie Bolcer. Police are now treating the case as suspicious. ""Until such a determination is made, the death may be classified as suspicious, in that the circumstances have not been clearly established,"" the NYPD said in a statement to CNN.  Robert Boyce, chief of detectives for NYPD, told reporters there were no apparent injuries to her body and her death did not appear to be criminal in nature.  Surveillance footage showed the judge walking alone near the river in the Harlem neighbourhood about 12 hours before her body was found in the water, according to the New York Police Department (NYPD). She was seen dressed in the same clothing she was wearing when her body was found, according to Sergeant Brendan Ryan.  Ms Abdus-Salaam's extended family has also pushed back on what they said are inaccurate reports that her mother and brother had committed suicide.  ""Sheila's mother, the matriarch of our family who died at age 92 in 2012, did not take her own life,"" the family said in a statement. ""Shelia's younger brother, who died in 2014, lost his battle with terminal lung cancer.""

"Venezuela crisis: Police fire tear gas as protests enter second day Police in Venezuela have fired tear gas during the second day of violent protests in the capital, Caracas. Three people were killed on Wednesday when opponents of President Nicolas Maduro took to the streets to march.  The huge protests in Caracas and western Venezuela come amid a serious economic crisis in the country. Opposition leaders have accused Mr Maduro of ruling the country like a dictator; the president says opponents are trying to topple him by force. Venezuela's opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, earlier this week called on the public to take part in anti-government protests across the country to press their demands for early presidential elections and the release of jailed politicians. On Thursday, police in Caracas, backed by armoured trucks, were targeted by a masked group of protesters hurling stones as they attempted to control the crowds. There were multiple reports of riot police firing tear gas at demonstrators who were fleeing from the scene with their faces covered with masks and bandanas.  What is behind the crisis? Some of Wednesday's marches also turned violent after protesters clashed with members of the security forces and supporters of Mr Maduro. Seventeen-year-old Carlos José Moreno was killed by a shot in the head in the centre of Caracas near an opposition demonstration. A 23-year-old student, Paola Ramirez, was also shot dead in the city of San Cristobal, near the Colombian border.  Her boyfriend told Reuters news agency that they were chased by armed men on motorbikes as they were leaving an anti-government protest in the city, also on a motorbike. A national guardsman was also shot and killed south of the capital. Opposition leaders blame the government for Venezuela's high inflation, rampant crime and shortages of basic goods. They have four key demands: The government and its supporters blame imperialist forces led by the United States for the dismal state of the economy and say they are victims of an ""economic war"" being waged against them.  They have vowed to ""defend the Bolivarian Revolution"". As previous attempts at dialogue between the government and the opposition have failed it is hard to see fresh negotiations starting anytime soon. The National Electoral Council could try to defuse the situation by setting a date for regional elections, which had originally been expected to be held last December. But for the immediate future, belligerent rhetoric and protests are likely to continue. Are you in Venezuela? What are your experiences of the protests?

"Paris Champs Elysees attack gunman named as Karim Cheurfi The gunman killed after shooting dead a policeman on the  Champs Elysees has been named by the Paris prosecutor as Karim Cheurfi, a convicted criminal. He used a Kalashnikov assault rifle to kill the police officer with two bullets to the head, François Molins told journalists in the French capital.  A note defending so-called Islamic State was found near his body. Candidates in Sunday's presidential election have been accused of exploiting the attack politically. Cheurfi had four criminal convictions, the prosecutor said. Friday is the last day of campaigning before Sunday's presidential election. The killer had spoken about wanting to kill police officers but had had no apparent link to Islamist radicalism, Mr Molins said. Cheurfi was arrested and his home searched in February after an inquiry was opened over reports that he had been talking of killing police and getting weapons, Mr Molins said. Hunting knives, masks and a GoPro camera were found but this was not considered sufficient proof of his murderous intent. ""At that stage, no link with the radical Islamist movement was apparent,"" the Paris prosecutor said. ""Nothing justified further investigations by my office.""   Born on New Year's Eve in 1977 in the Livry-Gargan suburb of north-eastern Paris, Cheurfi was jailed four times for attempted murder, violence and theft. In April 2001, while driving a stolen car, he fired on and wounded two men who had chased him, one of them a plain clothes police officer.   He last emerged from prison in October 2015 and was living in the eastern suburb of Chelles. His lawyer described him as psychologically fragile and neighbours in Chelles said he had never shown any interest in religion. Three members of the gunman's family have been arrested for questioning.  Driving an Audi, the gunman arrived in the Champs Elysees area at 20:47 (18:47 GMT) on Thursday and drove up to a police bus parked on the avenue, Mr Molins said. Getting out, he opened fire at the driver's window, killing a police officer inside. The officer has been named as Xavier Jugelé. He then went around the bus and fired on two police officers posted outside a Turkish tourist office. It was announced earlier that two officers had been injured.  Security forces later shot Cheurfi dead. Terrified eyewitnesses later recounted scenes of panic as they ran for cover. French investigators are trying to find out whether he had accomplices. IS announced soon after the attack that one of its ""fighters"" had carried out the attack but it named him as ""Abu Yousif al-Belgiki [the Belgian]"". ""We don't understand why Islamic State has identified the wrong person,"" a police source was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. ""What does seem clear is that Islamic State was planning something.""  Police officer Xavier Jugelé, 37, was an active campaigner for gay rights, French media report.  Originally from the Loire Valley region in central France, he had been serving in the capital since 2014, French daily Liberation writes (in French).  On 13 November 2015, he was deployed to secure the area around the Bataclan concert hall after the IS attack, Le Parisien writes (in French).  When the venue reopened last November with a concert by Sting, Mr Jugelé was there again, telling the US's People magazine: ""I'm happy to be here... We're here tonight as witnesses. Here to defend our civic values. This concert's to celebrate life. To say no to terrorists.""   Leading candidates on the right were accused by Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve of cynically exploiting the attack in the final hours of the campaign (which ends at midnight local time on Friday).  The far right's Marine Le Pen pledged to expel radical Islamists while the centre-right's François Fillon talked of fighting ""Islamist totalitarianism"". Both also attacked the record of the Socialist government in handling law and order. In Washington, US President Donald Trump, whose election win stunned much of the world last year, predicted in a tweet that the attack would ""have a big effect on [the] presidential election"".

"Trump makes a French election prediction On Friday morning Donald Trump dipped his presidential toe into French electoral politics, tweeting about the possible impact of the Paris shooting on Thursday that resulted in one police officer dead and two seriously wounded. ""Another terrorist attack in Paris,"" Mr Trump wrote. ""The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election!"" The previous day, during a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Mr Trump had quickly labelled the incident a ""terrorist attack"" - before even French authorities had done so. ""It's a very, very terrible thing that is going on in the world today,"" Mr Trump said. ""And what can you say? It just never ends. We have to be strong and we have to be vigilant, and I've been saying it for a long time."" That last line is certainly true.  While the dynamics of French politics are decidedly different from those in the US, Mr Trump may recall that another incident in Paris - the November 2015 mass shooting at the Bataclan theatre - helped solidify his lead in the polls leading into the Republican presidential primaries. ""Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration and the wall,"" he tweeted several days after the attack two years ago. ""After Paris, they're all on the bandwagon."" Mr Trump did not mention her by name, but the president seems to be predicting the Champs-Elysees shooting will be a boost for French nationalist candidate Marine Le Pen, who has campaigned on deporting suspected Islamic militants and a French withdrawal from the European Union. Although Mr Trump has not formally met the French presidential candidate, she is close to some of the same advisers who helped craft the president's populist message during his campaign last year and was spotted in Trump Tower during the presidential transition in January. Breitbart News, which was an early supporter of Mr Trump's improbable presidential bid, has also warmly covered Ms Le Pen's efforts. ""A new world is emerging, global equilibriums are being redefined by the fact of Trump's election,"" Ms Le Pen said the day after Mr Trump's presidential victory. ""Their world is crumbling; ours is being built."" While critics may view Mr Trump's Friday morning tweet as an unwelcome effort to influence the politics of another nation, the reality is slightly more complicated than that. Earlier on Thursday former President Barack Obama spoke with another leading French candidate, Emmanuel Macron, who has campaigned in favour of a strong European Union and open borders. ""The main message I have is to wish you all the best in the coming days."" Mr Obama said in an edited video of the call that Mr Macron posted on Twitter. ""And make sure, as you said, that you work very hard all the way through because you never know, it might be that last day of campaigning that makes all the difference."" ""Let's keep defending our progressive values,"" Mr Macron wrote. ""Thank you for this discussion @BarackObama"". In other words, the French election - from an American perspective, at least - could be setting up a proxy battle between the current and former president and their competing views of economic nationalism versus liberal globalism.  A similar dynamic played out during last June's Brexit referendum in the UK, when Mr Obama tacitly endorsed the Remain camp, while Mr Trump heralded the Leave victory as evidence that his nationalist politics were gathering strength. Now, after two notable defeats for the existing international establishment - in Brexit and Mr Trump's November election - Mr Obama may view Mr Macron as a last, best hope to stem a rising populist tide in the West. Although European Union supporters were heartened by the results in the recent Dutch elections, where nationalist candidate Geert Wilders was defeated, the French vote is a much more significant matter. Mr Trump and his advisers may view Ms Le Pen as the hand that will deliver a death blow to the European Union and cement his own election as more than a quirk of American politics and, instead, as the harbinger of a new global order.

"Canada police arrest 104 men in child prostitution dragnet Canadian police have arrested 104 men in connection with a child prostitution ring in and around the Toronto area. York Regional Police say the men attempted to purchase sex with an undercover officer, who posed as a girl between the ages of 13 and 16 online. Police targeted men who searched for prostitutes online, but did not arrest men who were seeking sex with an adult. In Canada, adults are allowed to sell sexual services, but it is illegal to buy sex.   ""We stopped 104 men from purchasing 104 children,"" Det Sgt Thai Truong said during a press conference on Friday. The investigation, dubbed Project Raphael, lasted four years. The goal of the undercover operation was to reduce demand for child prostitution by putting the men who seek it out behind bars, according to police. An undercover officer would engage with men looking to buy sex online, and then tell them that she was underage. ""Once they were told they were speaking with children, for the most part the men would stop,"" PC Truong said. During that time, officers were also able to rescue about 85 child victims. However, police say they were only able to arrest about half of the pimps in those cases because the girls were too afraid to participate in the investigation. Many of the girls showed signs of physical abuse, PC Truong said.  PC Truong says that most victims of sex trafficking began prostitution at about the age of 14. Of the 104 cases placed before the courts, 40 of the cases have been resolved, with 64 still before the courts. About a quarter of the accused plead guilty.  Four went to trial and of those four, three were found guilty and one man was acquitted.   Five cases of the 104 were withdrawn. In Canada, soliciting the sexual services of someone under 18 is a crime punishable by six months to 10 years in prison for first-time offenders.

"India visit 'very productive' despite controversy, says Sajjan Canada's Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan says his official visit to India has been ""very productive"" despite political tensions.  Mr Sajjan says he has been able to bolster ties between India and Canada.  Punjab's top elected official had accused him of sympathising with a Sikh independence movement, which he denies.  Mr Sajjan also distanced himself from a recent motion passed by a Canadian provincial legislature describing 1984 anti-Sikh riots as ""genocide"". The Canadian minister's six-day trip is meant as an opportunity to strengthen security and defence relations between the two nations, and he has met with his Indian counterparts and business executives.  But it hit turbulence when Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh alleged on a television program that Mr Sajjan was ""a Khalistani sympathiser"".  The Khalistan movement seeks to create a separate independent Sikh homeland in the Sikh-dominated northern state of Punjab. Canadian authorities have also linked Sikh separatist militants to Canada's 1985 Air India bombing, which killed 329 people.  Without offering names, Mr Singh also said other members of Canadian Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet held similar sentiments. Mr Singh refused to meet Mr Sajjan.  Canada has called Mr Singh's remarks ""disappointing and inaccurate"".  The BBC's Ravinder Singh Robin in Amritsar, Punjab:  It was a trip meant to strengthen bilateral ties, but with Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh refusing to meet him, Mr Sajjan's visit hit a sour note.  Mr Singh insisted that he had ""concrete information"" that Mr Sajjan was ""a Khalistani sympathiser, just as his father Kundan Sajjan, a board member of the World Sikh Organization"", but failed to provide any proof.  It's a charge Mr Sajjan - and the Canadian embassy in India - has denied. Mr Singh's political rivals have accused him of playing petty politics and humiliating the Sikh diaspora by not meeting Mr Sajjan. The chief minister's refusal to meet the Canadian minister has baffled many. Mr Singh had resigned from the Congress party in protest in 1984 after the Indian security forces entered the Golden Temple at Amritsar, leading to some suggestion that he, too, had some sympathy with the separatists. Also, a couple of years ago, he was photographed sharing a stage with senior Khalistani separatist leaders during a visit to Canada. And that's why there has been some suggestion that his current stand is motivated more by personal reasons - last year, the Canadian government did not allow him to hold political rallies in Toronto and Vancouver to raise funds for his election campaign. Minister Sajjan was also forced to tip-toe around another political controversy that has strained Canada-India relations.  Earlier this month, Ontario's legislature passed motion declaring the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in India ""genocide"".  Some 3,000 members of India's Sikh community were massacred in the days following the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards on 31 October 1984.  Members of the ruling Congress party were widely accused of encouraging the violence. Mr Sajjan carefully noted to journalists on Wednesday that it was a private member's motion put forward by a provincial Liberal politician - and not by Mr Trudeau's federal Liberal party.  He also referred to the 1984 riots as ""organised massacres"" and said Canada was working with counterparts in India on getting justice for the victims.  York University associate professor Michael Nijhawan says the dark chapter in Indian history still resonates in both countries.

"Russian MP Seleznev incensed after son jailed in US A member of the Russian parliament is outraged after his son was handed down a sentence of 27 years in prison for computer hacking crimes in the US. Roman Valeryevich Seleznev, 32, was convicted in August for stealing credit card data from US restaurants, causing nearly $170m (£132m) in damages.  Russian MP Valery Seleznev said the sentence was ""passed by man-eaters"" and that his son was ""abducted"". Seleznev made millions by selling the data on the dark web, US officials say. Mr Seleznev, a member of the lower house of the Russian legislature known as the Duma, is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the New York Times reports. ""My son was tortured because being in jail in a foreign country after abduction is torture in itself. He is innocent,"" he told RIA Novosti news agency. Mr Seleznev, a member of the the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR), said it was a life sentence because his son would never survive 27 years in prison.  Between 2009 and 2013, Seleznev hacked into retail point-of-sale systems and installed malicious software that enabled him to steal millions of credit card numbers from more than 500 American businesses and 3,700 financial institutions, according to the Justice Department. He then sent the data to servers he controlled in Russia, Ukraine and McLean, Virginia, and sold the information on criminal ""carding"" websites, where users bought them for fraudulent purchases, officials said.  Seleznev was taken into custody in July 2014 in the Maldives. His laptop at the time contained more than 1.7m stolen credit card numbers.  Evidence showed he raked in tens of millions of dollars from the scheme.  Many of the businesses he targeted were small businesses, including Broadway Grill in Seattle, which was forced into bankruptcy following the cyber-attack. ""Today is a bad day for hackers around the world,"" said US Attorney Annette L Hayes. ""The notion that the internet is a Wild West where anything goes is a thing of the past.  ""Whether the victims are multi-national banks or small pizza joints, we are all victims when our day-to-day transactions result in millions of dollars ending up in the wrong hands.""",Saturday 22 April 2017,22-Apr-17,Russian MP enraged after son jailed in US,"Valery Seleznev said the sentence was ""passed by man-eaters"" and that his son was ""abducted"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39672498
"Serena Williams: Ilie Nastase heard making derogatory comment By Russell Fuller BBC tennis correspondent Romania's Fed Cup captain, the former world number one and Grand Slam champion Ilie Nastase, has been heard making a derogatory comment about Serena Williams' unborn child. As Romanian player Simona Halep was answering a question in English about Williams' pregnancy at Friday's Fed Cup draw in Constanta, the 70-year-old turned to one of his other team members and added in Romanian: ""Let's see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?"" A spokesman for the International Tennis Federation has told the BBC it is aware of the comments and has begun an immediate investigation. ""The ITF does not tolerate discriminatory and offensive language and behaviour of any kind,"" the statement reads. ""We are aware of alleged comments made by Romanian captain Ilie Nastase and have begun an immediate investigation so that we have the full facts of the situation before taking further and appropriate action."" Romanian journalists present did not ask anything more about the statement but appeared to try to pass off the comment as a joke. This is the second time in a month that Nastase has made comments about the American world number two. In late March he made unsubstantiated allegations about Williams' doping record to the Romanian website Digisport. During the draw ceremony on Friday, Nastase also put his arm tightly around British team captain Anne Keothavong and asked for her room number, in earshot of the watching media. I understand that Nastase made a similar comment to Keothavong, who is pregnant with her second child, at Thursday's team dinner. George Cosac, president of the Romanian Tennis Federation, was at the draw but did not stay for the news conference and will not comment on the matter. Great Britain and Romania begin their two-day World Group play-off tie on Saturday at 10:00 BST. Williams is due to give birth in the autumn and had posted a picture on Snapchat on Wednesday, posing in a mirror with the message: ""20 weeks"", before deleting it. But the news was confirmed later on Wednesday by her representative. Williams will miss the rest of the season, having not played since the Australian Open, citing a knee injury. Williams, who will return to world number one next week, would be eligible to retain her ranking under the WTA special ranking rule if she is ready to play her first tournament within 12 months of giving birth. Williams announced her engagement to the co-founder of community news site Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, in December. The American is top of the all-time list of major winners since Grand Slams accepted professional players in 1968. She is second only to Australian Margaret Court on the list of women's all-time Grand Slam singles titles leaders - Court won 24 titles between 1960 and 1973. Court, who won the singles Grand Slam in 1970, gave birth to her first child in March 1972, aged 29, and returned to win three of the four Grand Slam events in 1973. Williams is a five-time Tour finals winner, the last of which came in 2014, and was recently picked as the greatest female tennis player of the Open era by BBC Sport readers.

"Afghan casualties in Taliban Mazar-e Sharif attack pass 100 More than 100 Afghan soldiers were killed or wounded in a Taliban attack on an army base on Friday, the defence ministry has confirmed. Fighting lasted for several hours near the city of Mazar-e Sharif in northern Balkh province.  Insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen, the army said. The Taliban said in a statement they had carried out the attack, using suicide bombers to breach defences. Earlier estimates put the death toll as high as 134, but a statement from the defence ministry on Saturday gave the figure of more than 100 killed or injured.  It is one of the deadliest tolls in a Taliban attack on the Afghan army. At least 10 Taliban militants were also killed in the fighting and one attacker was detained. The Afghan government has declared Sunday a day of national mourning. Separately, the US military command in Afghanistan said that Taliban commander Quari Tayib had been killed in a coalition air strike. It said that Tayib was ""once known as the shadow Taliban governor of Takhar province"" in the north-east, and was killed along with eight other Taliban fighters in the strike on 17 April. The Taliban fighters who attacked the base wore army uniforms and drove through checkpoints to launch the raid, a military spokesman said. One injured soldier, Mohammad Hussain, said: ""When I came out of the mosque, three people with army uniforms and an army vehicle started shooting at us. Of course, they had some infiltrators inside the base, otherwise they would never have been able to enter. ""One of them sitting inside a vehicle had set up a machine gun at the car's window and shot everyone in his way."" President Ashraf Ghani flew to the area on Saturday and visited wounded troops. US military spokesman John Thomas described the attack as a ""significant"" strike, but he praised Afghan commandos for bringing the ""atrocity to an end"". There are conflicting reports about casualties. The defence ministry confirmed more than 100 soldiers had been ""killed or injured"" but a security official in Mazar-e Sharif told the BBC that more than 100 had died, including a top military commander. Relatives of some of the soldiers gathered outside the base to take possession of coffins. They all questioned the security measures in place at the main entrance. ""If strict inspections had taken place, the attackers would not have passed the first gate,"" said Jan Agah, from Jowzjan province. One of his nephews serving at the base died and another was injured in the attack. The raid shows the Taliban can plan and carry out complex attacks. The militants said four of the attackers had served as soldiers for a long time and had knowledge of every corner of the base. The base at Mazar-e-Sharif is home to the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for providing security to most of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province - which has seen heavy recent fighting. Several German and other foreign soldiers are reported to be garrisoned there. Last month about 50 people were reported to have died when militants believed to be from the group known as Islamic State targeted patients and staff at a military hospital in Kabul with guns, grenades and knives. Also in March the Taliban said they had captured the crucial south Afghan district of Sangin after a year-long battle.",Saturday 22 April 2017,22-Apr-17,Dozens dead in Taliban army base attack,Taliban fighters drove through checkpoints dressed in army uniforms before launching the attack.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39672357
"Syria war: US ground troops kill 'leading IS member' US troops have targeted and killed a leading member of the so-called Islamic State (IS) group in a commando raid in Syria, military officials say. The attack took place near the town of Mayadin in eastern Syria.   Abdurakhmon Uzbeki, who was believed to be from Uzbekistan, is said by the Americans to be a close associate of the IS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The US says he played a key role in an attack on a night club in Istanbul on New Year's Eve which killed 39 people. Turkish police arrested Abdulkadir Masharipov, the main suspect in the attack, on 17 January after a huge manhunt. ""It was a ground operation. I think that's all we're willing to say about that,"" US Central Command spokesman Col John Thomas said in Washington in relation to Friday's attack. For the most part, the US has used unmanned drone strikes with Hellfire missiles to kill what they term ""high value individuals"", often targeting them in vehicles to minimise the possibility of collateral civilian deaths. But while using troops on the ground to target IS leaders is unusual, it is not unheard of. In 2015, US special forces troops killed Abu Sayyaf in Syria not far from the site of this recent operation. Abu Sayyaf was described as chief financial officer for IS and his wife was captured and interrogated. Another such raid took place in January of this year in which US forces hoped to capture an individual for interrogation, but he was killed in a shootout. Using ground troops is of course more risky than flying drones. But it can often bring greater rewards as special forces can capture computers and other sources of intelligence which would otherwise be vaporised by a Hellfire missile. At any one time there are around 500 members of US special forces in Syria, mainly advising and assisting Kurdish and Arab groups fighting IS.  An ""expeditionary targeting force"" has operated inside Iraq and Syria to target senior IS and al-Qaeda leaders since late 2015, ABC reported, but usually details of their operations on the ground are not disclosed. Col Thomas was quoted by ABC as saying that the US has ""a pretty good record of finding these folks and killing them"". Reina at the time of the attack was one of Istanbul's best-known clubs, with a view across the Bosphorus towards Asia and attracting singers, actors, sports stars and tourists. Uzbek national Abdulkadir Masharipov is believed to have mounted the assault on the club, rushing through the entrance with a long-barrelled gun and firing randomly at people celebrating the new year. Citizens of Israel, France, Tunisia, Lebanon, India, Belgium, Jordan and Saudi Arabia were among the victims, and dozens of people were injured. IS said it orchestrated the attack, saying it was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria. Police arrested Masharipov more than two weeks after the attack, when he was found along with his four year-old son at the home of a Kyrgyz friend in Istanbul.",Saturday 22 April 2017,22-Apr-17,US commandos 'kill IS plotter' in Syria,The US says Abdurakhmon Uzbeki is a close associate of the IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39673142
"Kidnapped Qatari hunting party of 26 freed in Iraq after 16 months A group of Qatari hunters - including members of the ruling family - have been freed 16 months after being kidnapped in Iraq, officials say.  The Iraqi interior ministry said ""all 26"" were in Baghdad and would be handed over to a Qatari envoy.  The hunters were abducted by gunmen in a desert area of Iraq near the Saudi border in December 2015. A large-scale search was launched but very little information was known about the group's whereabouts or condition. On Friday, the group was flown back to Qatar's capital, Doha, Iraqi officials said. Their release was part of a far-reaching regional deal involving the evacuation of civilians in neighbouring Syria, AFP news agency reports, citing sources close to the negotiations. ""The interior ministry has received the Qatari hunters, all 26 of them,"" an Iraqi interior ministry official told AFP, adding: ""They will be handed over to the Qatari envoy."" Footage later released by the ministry showed some of the former hostages dressed in white gowns and red headscarves as they were greeted by officials in the high security Green Zone in Iraq's capital, Baghdad. They were then seen in the video boarding a Qatar Airways plane at Baghdad airport. State media later confirmed that they had landed in Doha. The group was seized in December 2015 while on a licensed hunting trip near the border with Saudi Arabia. The hostages were abducted when gunmen swept into their camp at dawn in four-by-four vehicles. The hunting party is widely believed to include one or several more prominent members of the Qatari royal family, although they have not been identified. They were hunting the Asian houbara bustard, akin to a small turkey, using falcons trained to home in on their quarry. Their release is said to be connected to a complex deal in Syria involving the evacuation of four besieged towns, which was announced earlier this week.  However, the interior ministry has not provided details confirming this. The Guardian newspaper has reported that an Iraqi militia with strong ties to Iran, a key backer of the Syrian government and its ally Hezbollah, was holding the Qatari hunters. It says the deal involves the Syrian Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham, Iran, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Qatar. A Qatari royal and a Pakistani man were freed earlier this month. Also on Friday, a spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham told Reuters that the Syrian government was going to release 500 prisoners into rebel-held territory, as part of a swap deal. It is an agreement to end the sieges of four towns - two surrounded by pro-government forces, two by rebel and Islamist fighters - in eastern Syria. Foah and Kefraya are mainly Shia Muslim, government-held towns, close to the border with Lebanon, which have been besieged since March 2015. Madaya and Zabadani are rebel-held towns in the north-east, which have been besieged since June 2015 by the Syrian army and fighters from Lebanon's Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement. Conditions have been desperate, especially in Madaya and Zabadani, with severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel. International aid deliveries have been infrequent and required careful negotiation. Government air drops have eased the situation in Foah and Kefraya somewhat. Under the exchange deal, residents of Foah and Kefraya are being bussed to government-held Aleppo, while people in Madaya and Zabadani are being taken to rebel-held areas. The evacuations began last week, but were held up after a bomb attack hit the convoy of buses from the two government-held towns, killing at least 126 people including 68 children. Thousands of evacuees from Foah and Kefraya have also been held up at a staging point for 48 hours, but a rebel involved in the operation told AFP that the buses had left after the news of the release of government-held prisoners. According to AFP, the current phase of evacuations involves 8,000 people from Foah and Kafraya, and 2,500 civilians and rebels from Madaya and Zabadani.   A second phase is to begin in June.",Saturday 22 April 2017,22-Apr-17,Qatari hunting party freed in Iraq,Their release is said to be part of a complex deal to evacuate four besieged Syrian towns.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39669501
"Egyptian soldiers accused of killing unarmed Sinai men in leaked video A video has emerged that allegedly shows Egyptian soldiers shooting dead unarmed detainees in the northern Sinai region, where the military is carrying out an anti-terror offensive. The footage, which is unverified, appears to show military officers rearranging the scene to make it seem as if a gun battle had taken place. Soldiers are shown apparently placing weapons beside the dead bodies. A pro-government news site has said that the 2016 video is a fabrication.  So far there has been no comment from the Egyptian military, which has previously released footage - apparently from the same incident late last year - saying it had eliminated a ""dangerous terrorist cell"" after a heavy exchange of gunfire. Human rights group Amnesty International said it had analysed the footage. It showed ""cold blooded killings"", which it said should be urgently investigated by the Egyptian authorities. The footage, which emerged on Thursday, was apparently filmed with a mobile phone and has been broadcast on Mekameleen TV, a station that supports the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. It appears to show two detainees being shot at point-blank range by Egyptian soldiers.  One man is already on the ground when he is shot four times. Later, a rifle has appeared by his side. A younger man, who appears to be unarmed, is blindfolded and briefly interrogated before apparently being shot dead.  Egypt's army has, for years, been carrying out an offensive against Islamist militants in the northern Sinai peninsula, where an affiliate of so-called Islamic State (IS) is active. However, Najia Bounaim, Amnesty International's campaigns director for North Africa, said there had also been a ""disturbing pattern"" of apparent extrajudicial executions in the area.  The organisation is also calling for an investigation into the deaths of six men, who were allegedly killed in police custody in North Sinai in January.  Earlier this month, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered military deployments across Egypt after dozens of people were killed in two blasts targeting Coptic Christians on Palm Sunday. IS said it was behind the explosions. Last month, 10 Egyptian soldiers were killed by two roadside bomb blasts during a raid against jihadist militants in the Sinai peninsula, according to military officials.

"South Africa bus crash 'kills at least 19 children' At least 19 children have been killed in a minibus crash near the South African capital, Pretoria, emergency services and officials say. The children died after the vehicle burst into flames following a collision with a truck just north of the capital. There were understood to be both primary and secondary school-aged children on board. Panyaza Lesufi, the official responsible for education in Gauteng province, said it was a ""dark day"". The minibus collided with a truck on the single carriageway R25, between Verena in Mpumalanga and Bronkhorstspruit in Gauteng, having left from Mahlenga High. The emergency services rescued seven children before the bus burst into flames. ""It is believed the driver of minibus underestimated the speed of the truck and collided with him whilst turning,"" the Gauteng Education Department said in a statement. Police later said the bus driver was also killed in the accident, while the driver of the truck survived.  Pictures show the minibus on its side, entirely burnt out. In a statement, emergency medical service ER24 described arriving at the scene, where firefighters were tackling the flames. A number of children had already been pulled out by ""members of the community"", the statement said. ""Once the flames had been extinguished, paramedics found that approximately 13 children [were] lying trapped inside the vehicle. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the children and they were declared dead on the scene,"" the statement added. There seems to be no end in sight to South Africa's road carnage.  This latest tragedy comes hot on the heels of a 50% increase of road deaths from last year's Easter period.  Authorities keep doing the same thing but expecting a different result.  In a country with one of the most advanced road networks on the African continent, clearly the problem lies elsewhere. Drivers' behavioural patterns need to be changed through a combination of education and stricter law enforcement regime amongst other factors.  The transport minister once said ""we cannot have a policeman at every intersection. We are not a police state"". Could that approach be the problem perhaps?    Hopefully this latest tragedy will shock South Africans, both in and outside government, into action which will ultimately bring an end to these unnecessary deaths. The African National Congress (ANC) later said that it was ""gravely saddened"" by the deaths of the school pupils following the ""heart-breaking accident"" on Friday. ""It is a sad day for South Africa,"" the statement said, adding that the ANC ""extends its deepest condolences to the bereaved families"".  ER24 and the Gauteng Education Department had earlier reported that a total of 20 people had been killed, with the education department adding that two of the dead were adults. ""This is a huge loss and we're deeply pained by the tragic news,"" the education department tweeted. South Africa has some of the deadliest roads in the world. According to the country's Road Traffic Management Corporation, there were 13,673 deaths in the 12 months from October 2015 - which equates to more than 37 people dying every day.",Saturday 22 April 2017,22-Apr-17,Bus crash 'kills 19 children' in S Africa,"The minibus driver also died in the crash near the capital Pretoria, authorities say.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39671534
"Borussia Dortmund bombs: 'Speculator' charged with bus attack Police in Germany have charged a man suspected of being behind an attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus. Rather than having links to radical Islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury.  He has been  identified only as Sergej W, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 April, Borussia Dortmund's home Champions League match against Monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led Dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast ""significant doubt"" on jihadist motivations being behind it. They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed. Sergej W, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, Germany's Bild newspaper reported. In a statement on Friday (in German), the German federal prosecutor's office said he has German and Russian nationality. He was arrested on Friday near Tubingen in Rottenburg, south-west Germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on Borussia Dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack.  He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. He was staying at the team's L'Arrivée hotel in Dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 April using an IP address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money.  Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was damaged about six miles from the Westfalenstadion - officially called Signal Iduna Park - in Dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off. Pictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst.",Saturday 22 April 2017,22-Apr-17,Dortmund bus blast 'for money not terror',"A 28-year-old allegedly attacked the bus, injuring one footballer, to earn from falling share prices.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39664212
"Venezuela: Ten people killed in Caracas looting incident Ten people have been killed in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, during a looting incident at a bakery.  Footage recorded by residents showed heavy shooting and police in armoured vehicles trying to regain control of the situation in El Valle district.   In a separate incident, a man was shot outside the capital at the end of an opposition march. The violence comes at the end of two days of protests against the President Maduro's socialist government.  Three other people were killed during protests on Wednesday and Thursday. The authorities blamed opposition activists for most of the deaths in the El Valle looting incident, which happened late on Thursday night. Two people were shot dead trying to loot a bakery, while eight others stepped on a high voltage cable, which the government says was sabotaged by opposition groups. The opposition has called for silent marches across Venezuela on Saturday to honour the people killed in protests over the past three weeks. The latest wave of protests was triggered by a Supreme Court decision on 29 March to take over powers from the opposition-controlled National Assembly. When it reversed its decision three days later, it was already too late to contain the opposition and street demonstrations. Opposition leaders are calling for new presidential elections and the release of politicians arrested since Mr Maduro took office four years ago.  Venezuela is facing a serious economic crisis, despite having the world's largest proven oil reserves. Inflation is expected to reach 700% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. There are shortages of many goods and violence has flared up again. Mr Maduro has accused the opposition of using violence and looting to create chaos and destabilise his government. ""I am more determined than ever to defend my country and my people against right-wing coup plotters,"" he said on Wednesday during a pro-government rally attended by tens of thousands of his supporters. ""I won't give in an inch,"" Mr Maduro added. His term ends in 2019 and the next elections are not due until late 2018.  The opposition says the country can no longer cope with the chronic shortage of basic goods, medicine and a lack of investment.

"Mazar-e Sharif attack: Afghanistan mourns deadly Taliban assault Afghanistan is holding a day of national mourning after the Taliban attacked an army base, killing or wounding more than 100 soldiers. President Ashraf Ghani said the assault near the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif had been contrary to all human values and Islamic teachings.  Insurgents targeted those leaving Friday prayers at the base's mosque and others in a canteen, the army said. Some of the survivors suggested the attackers had had inside help. One of the injured soldiers said: ""When an attacker enters the base, why was he not challenged? There is not just one barrier or security gate, there are seven or eight."" The Taliban in a statement said it had carried out the attack, one of the deadliest on a military site in a country that has seen numerous insurgent attacks. The fighters, dressed in Afghan military uniforms and driving military vehicles, made their way into the compound before opening fire, the army said. At least 10 Taliban militants were also killed in the fighting and one attacker was detained. The Afghan defence ministry did not release exact figures for Friday's attack, only saying more than 100 soldiers had died or been injured.  But other officials, speaking anonymously, said the death toll was at least 140.  ""Three months ago I sent my son to the army, I have not seen him since then,"" one father told AFP news agency. ""And today, they give me his remains."" President Ghani flew to the area on Saturday and visited wounded troops. The base at Mazar-e-Sharif is home to the Afghan National Army's 209th Corps, responsible for providing security to most of northern Afghanistan, including Kunduz province - which has seen heavy recent fighting.

"Germany AfD: Right-wingers set to move further right The populist, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) has rejected a bid by its co-leader to move the party closer to the mainstream. Frauke Petry had wanted the AfD to seek coalition with other parties and reject extremist views but delegates in Cologne rejected her approach. She has announced she will not contest general elections this year and the party must choose a replacement. Outside the conference protesters clashed with police. Up to 15,000 people demonstrated against the AfD's meeting, with some 4,000 officers deployed to stop them entering the hotel where is was taking place. Two were injured in clashes, one while escorting party members. There were several reports of arrests. Many shops were closed for the day and police helicopters were heard overhead, with some suggesting this was to monitor the protests. About 100 people tried to break through a police line on the opposite side of the Rhine river from the conference venue, Die Welt newspaper reports (in German).  Outside the hotel, up to 60 people blocked access using a chain of bicycles. Police broke this up, leading to skirmishes with protesters. It is not the first time an AfD conference has attracted demonstrations. When the party met last year in Stuttgart, hundreds of protesters were detained. AfD co-leader and public face Frauke Petry announced earlier this week that she would not be the party's chief candidate in the September general election. At the conference Ms Petry urged the party to reject infighting and unite behind the leadership, to prove the AfD was ""here to stay"".  But those attending refused even to hold a debate on her arguments that the party should become more mainstream and seek to govern in coalition rather than staying in opposition. Thousands of armed police officers were deployed to hold protesters back from the city centre hotel where Germany's most controversial party was holding its pre-election conference. Inside, the atmosphere was no less fractious. The AfD, which is notorious for its fierce anti-Islam rhetoric, is slipping in the polls. The anti-immigrant platform which won it support during the refugee crisis is no longer enough to satisfy the electorate.  The party is on course to win seats in the general election but its chances of significant political success depend now on whether its members can agree on a candidate to stand against Angela Merkel and on the party's future direction. While this weekend is officially a party conference, in truth it will be a weekend of crisis talks. The party pushed Mrs Merkel's governing conservatives into third place in a regional election last year and hopes to build on its success by getting its first seats in the federal parliament.  Founded in 2013, it rose on a wave of opposition to Mrs Merkel's 2015 open-door policy to refugees. However, all the mainstream parties have said they will refuse to form a coalition with the AfD.  Opinion polls suggest a sharp recent drop in the party's popularity - from 15% late last year to between 7% and 11% now.  It is beset by infighting between Ms Petry's pragmatic wing and a wing that is further to the right.  The party's reputation has been dented by a local leader's comments in January that the Holocaust memorial in Berlin was a ""memorial of shame"".  The party has voted to expel him and he will not be allowed to attend the conference.",Sunday 23 April 2017,23-Apr-17,German right-wingers to go further right,Delegates at the AfD conference reject efforts by its leader to make the party more moderate.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39677510
"American Airlines suspends employee after clash over pram American Airlines has removed an employee from duty after an ugly clash over a baby's pram in San Francisco. A passenger who uploaded video of the aftermath of the incident said a mother had been struck with the pram as it was forcibly removed by the employee. The video shows the employee saying, ""Hit me! Come on, bring it on!"", when challenged by another male passenger. American Airlines said it was ""deeply sorry for the pain we have caused"" the woman passenger and her family. The incident follows another high-profile clash on a United Airlines plane two weeks ago, when a passenger was violently removed from an overbooked flight. The American Airlines incident took place at San Francisco International Airport as flight 591 prepared to take off for Dallas/Fort Worth. Passenger Surain Adyanthaya, who posted the video to Facebook, said that preceding the footage the employee had ""violently"" taken the pram from the mother, hitting her and narrowly missing her baby. The footage shows the mother clearly distraught as other employees and passengers try to intervene. One male passenger demands the name of the employee involved and when a man dressed in American Airlines uniform enters the plane, the passenger tells him: ""Hey, bud, you do that to me and I'll knock you flat."" The employee confronts the passenger, telling him to ""stay out of this"", then saying: ""Hit me! Come on, bring it on."" He adds: ""You don't even know what the story is."" The passenger replies: ""I don't care what the story is. You almost hurt a baby."" In its statement, American Airlines said: ""What we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers. We are deeply sorry for the pain we have caused this passenger and her family and to any other customers affected by the incident."" It said it was ""making sure all of her family's needs are being met while she is in our care"". The airline upgraded the woman and her family to first class when she took another flight to Dallas. ""The actions of our team member captured here do not appear to reflect patience or empathy, two values necessary for customer care. In short, we are disappointed by these actions,"" the airline said. A statement from the Association of Professional Flight Attendants stressed that all passengers deserve to be treated with respect, but warned against rushing to judgement before the full facts were known.",Sunday 23 April 2017,23-Apr-17,Airline apologises after clash over pram,An American Airlines employee is removed from duty after the ugly exchange in San Francisco.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39677296
"Lebanon rape law: Wedding dresses hang in Beirut sea front protest Activists campaigning to change Lebanon's law on rape have staged a macabre protest on Beirut's famous sea front.  What appeared to be more than 30 white wedding dresses were hung from nooses, strung up between the palm trees.  Lebanese law currently allows a rapist to be exonerated if he marries his victim.  The activists are pressing to have the legislation abolished at an upcoming session of parliament. Minister for Women's Affairs Jean Oghassabian described the article as being ""from the stone age"". ""There are 31 days in a month and every single day, a woman may be raped and forced to marry her rapist,"" said Alia Awada from the non-governmental organisation Abaad. A proposal to scrap Article 522 of the penal code, which deals with rape, assault, kidnapping and forced marriage, was introduced last year and approved by a parliamentary committee in February. Activists hope that MPs will vote to abolish it when it goes to a vote on 15 May. BBC World Service Middle East editor Alan Johnston says the ghostly wedding dresses swaying in the wind beneath their nooses conjure a sense of a brutal snuffing out of life and hope. That is the sort of impact the controversial law may have on victims of rape, our correspondent says. The installation was designed in Paris by Lebanese artist Mireille Honein. She told AFP news agency that Article 522 had left women ""without an identity"" and was ""shameful for those imposing it on them"". Last December, women dressed in wedding dresses made from bandages to protest against the law. Mireille Honein's hanging wedding dresses are the latest in a line of protests using artistic expression to highlight violence against women Domestic violence: A group of ""guerilla feminists"" in China marched up a Beijing street wearing wedding dresses spattered with red paint to highlight the issue, little debated in the country, but were later detained for more than a month in 2015 on public disorder charges, sparking an international outcry So-called ""honour"" crime: Eighteen-year-old Tunisian feminist Amina Sboui wrote ""my body belongs to me.

"March for Science: Rallies worldwide to protest against political interference Thousands of scientists have taken part in demonstrations around the world in protest against what they see as a global political assault on facts. The first-ever March for Science, which was timed to coincide with Earth Day, was aimed at promoting action to protect the environment. Organisers said it was a celebration of science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community.  The main event was held in Washington DC. The event's promoters said the march in the US capital was not aimed against President Donald Trump, while adding that his administration had ""catalysed"" the movement. At the demonstration in Washington DC, Dr Jonathan Foley, the executive director of the California Academy of Sciences, said that research was being irrationally questioned, adding that attacks from politicians ""amounted to oppression"". ""They're specifically targeting science that protects our health, our safety and the environment. Science that protects the most vulnerable among us,"" he said.  ""Some people will suffer, some could even die,"" Dr Foley added. From climate change and pollution to medicine, men and women who support science were motivated on Saturday by the coverage of the recent Women's March and are mobilising to make their concerns heard.  Organisers of the March for Science Vienna, in Austria, earlier said on the group's Facebook page that it was encouraging people to turn out to join a movement that began shortly after Mr Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump has previously called climate change a hoax and his views have raised concerns among the scientific community that the public are beginning to doubt the facts provided as scientific evidence. In London, scientists and science enthusiasts marched from the Science Museum to Parliament Square.  Many were protesting against what they consider to be an ""alarming trend"" among politicians for discrediting their research.  The aim of the March for Science was to bring scientists and their research closer to the general public.  Organisers are of the view that it can be challenging for scientists to communicate with the public and are even actively encouraging scientists to become politicians so that their voices can be effectively heard.

"Fed Cup: Ilie Nastase banned after swearing at tearful Johanna Konta   
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Romania captain Ilie Nastase was banned from the Fed Cup tie against Britain after an incident that left Johanna Konta in tears and her match suspended. In Konta's match against Sorana Cirstea, Nastase was sent off after swearing at the umpire and abusing Konta and her captain Anne Keothavong. The world number seven lost her serve in the next game and was visibly upset before play was halted for 25 minutes. The International Tennis Federation is investigating Nastase's conduct. The world governing body said it was looking into ""this matter as well as previous comments made by Mr Nastase during the week"". Nastase - a former world number one - had caused controversy in the build-up to the tie after being heard making a derogatory comment about Serena Williams' unborn child. While Romanian player Simona Halep was answering a question in English about Williams' pregnancy on Friday, the 70-year-old turned to one of his other team members and added in Romanian: ""Let's see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?"" He also put his arm tightly around Keothavong and asked for her room number, in earshot of the watching media. Before play had even started on Saturday, Nastase insulted a British journalist over their reporting of Friday's events, calling the Press Association's tennis correspondent ""stupid"". And as he was finally escorted away from the venue by a group of security guards, he abused the reporter again, calling her ""ugly"".  WARNING: Some people may find the language below offensive The incident that led to him being dismissed on Saturday happened when Cirstea was 2-1 up in the second set of the World Group II play-off tie in Constanta. After Konta and Keothavong had complained of calling out from the crowd at 1-1, Nastase was involved in a discussion with officials in which he used foul and abusive language. Nastase called both Konta and Keothavong ""a bitch"" multiple times, as well as swearing at them. He was sent off the court by referee Andreas Egli and, after initially taking a seat in the stands, was then escorted back to the locker room. Konta went 3-1 down after her serve was broken in the next game and was in tears before the umpire suspended play. Romania player Halep spoke to the crowd during the suspension to try to calm the situation. When play resumed in a subdued atmosphere, Konta won five games in a row to win the match 6-2 6-3, levelling the tie at 1-1. The ITF explained Nastase was asked to leave ""for unsportsmanlike conduct, having already received two official warnings"".  A statement added: ""Mr Nastase was also removed from the grounds due to his serious misconduct. His accreditation was removed and he will play no further part in the tie.""

                         ""It was not something anyone should experience,"" Konta told BBC Sport. ""It did upset me quite a lot and that was shown. I am not one to cry on court. It was slightly embarrassing but it affected me more than I would have liked.  ""I know that Fed Cups can be quite emotional and can sometimes take an unexpected turn but it wasn't something I was prepared for.  ""Obviously, it left me slightly unnerved but the best I could do was to make it as much about the tennis as possible. I felt I did that and am looking forward to that again tomorrow.""  Keothavong said she had ""expected a patriotic crowd"", but did not expect ""abusive language to be used"".  ""It's unacceptable. No-one deserves to be spoken to in that way,"" she told BBC Sport.  ""We've come here to play tennis. The referee made the right call to suspend the match, and during the break I was just trying to keep Johanna calm. ""All of the players - from both teams - handled the situation incredibly well. It's happened, it's done and there is a lot to play for tomorrow.""  The Lawn Tennis Association said it was ""deeply shocked"" by Saturday's events. ""There is no place in sport for that type of behaviour, it's not acceptable and the integrity of the sport must always be paramount,"" it said in a statement.  ""We will be submitting an official complaint to the ITF after this tie and expect a full investigation into the actions by the Romanian captain."" However, Cirstea claimed Konta had ""overreacted"".  ""Someone crying cannot stop a match,"" she told BBC Sport.   ""From a tennis point of view, Johanna deserved the win - she is a better player than me - but the behaviour of the British team was exaggerated.  ""Why did we stop? Only because Johanna cried? I have never cried on the court because someone told me something. You have to toughen up.  ""OK, at 2-1 you take our captain out, that was the right decision, but then at 3-1 I break you and now you cry. I am not saying it was fake, but it was not logical. ""Next time I'm in trouble I will cry, maybe I can go off the court. As Romanians we get double insulted because of our nation but it's OK, we are tough. Tougher than British people apparently.""

                         Before play started on Saturday, Nastase went into the media centre to seek out British journalists over their reporting of the comments he made about Williams at Friday's news conference.  Press Association Sport reported that their tennis correspondent Eleanor Crooks was the only member of the British media present in the room at the time and that he said to her: ""Why did you write that? You're stupid, you're stupid."" PA Sport has sent details of Nastase's remarks to the International Tennis Federation. ""He repeatedly called me stupid, asked me why what he said was racist,"" said Crooks. ""I explained we simply reported what he said and that it was unnecessary to make such a comment about colour. He said the English were out to get him and called me stupid a few more times. ""Fortunately he was across the other side of the room from me and there were other journalists around so it was unpleasant rather than threatening. ""But it is certainly not the behaviour you would expect of someone in his position and wholly unnecessary, especially given he did not dispute the accuracy of what was reported."" And when Nastase was escorted from the venue on Saturday he confronted Crooks again, calling her ""ugly"" as he was being led away by security. Sorry, this content is no longer available. Romanian Tennis Federation president George Cosac defended Nastase.   When asked about the comments made about Williams and to Keothavong on Friday, he told told BBC Sport: ""That's Nastase. He was all the time with a lot of jokes. That's why everybody likes him. ""He didn't make any mistakes. It was not racist, you cannot take it seriously. I'm sure it was just a joke,"" Cosac added.  ""What I know is that he is a very good friend with Yannick Noah and he played many tournaments together with Arthur Ashe [Noah and Ashe are the only black men to win Grand Slam singles titles] - I'm sure he didn't say something wrong."" Earlier on Saturday, Romania took the lead when Halep won 26 of the last 33 points on her way to comfortably beating Heather Watson 6-4 6-1. World number five Halep increased her intensity at 4-4 and broke Watson to love before serving out to take the opening set for the hosts. Watson, ranked 113, struggled to cope with her rival as she lost her serve twice to love in the second set. Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent This was a very decorated player, but an increasingly isolated man, losing his cool on a spectacular scale.  Nastase appears to have no concept of why I, and my three British colleagues here in Constanta, felt his slurs and actions of Friday needed highlighting.  Having targeted one of the journalists in the morning, he turned his ire on his opposite number and her star player when battle was joined on the court. ITF president Dave Haggerty says Nastase's conduct is ""unacceptable"". They have issued more than one stern statement this weekend, but will be judged on their deeds, rather than their words. If the ITF do not act, then the Romanian Federation clearly will not either. Their president cannot understand why we do not appreciate Nastase's sense of humour.

"General election: Tory victory 'will not strengthen May's Brexit hand' Theresa May's claims that a general election victory will strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations have been called ""nonsensical"" by the European Parliament's chief Brexit co-ordinator. Guy Verhofstadt, a long-standing critic of Brexit, wrote in The Observer that it was ""irrelevant"" whether the Conservatives increased their majority. Instead, Mrs May appeared to be driven by ""political opportunism"", he said.  Mrs May says the poll is needed because Westminster is divided over Brexit.  The decision to hold the election on 8 June - three years earlier than scheduled - was approved on Wednesday, with 522 MPs in favour and 13 against.   Mr Verhofstadt wrote: ""The theory espoused by some, that Theresa May is calling a general election on Brexit in order to secure a better deal with the EU, is nonsensical. ""Will the election of more Tory MPs give Theresa May a greater chance of securing a better Brexit deal?  ""For those sitting around the table in Brussels, this is an irrelevance."" Mr Verhofstadt added that many in Brussels believed the chances of a deal were being eroded by Mrs May's ""tough negotiating red lines"" and a lack of ""political room for manoeuvre"" domestically. He said there was no guarantee ""a sprinkling of additional Conservative MPs on the backbenches"" would change this.  ""Indeed, it appears this election is being driven by the political opportunism of the party in government, rather than by the people they represent,"" he added. Mrs May has argued that an increased Commons majority would strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations, making it more difficult for the opposition parties at home to obstruct her plans. In her speech on 18 April, announcing the decision to call an election, she said: ""Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country. ""So we need a general election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin.""

"Michele Scarponi: Italian cyclist dies in training crash   Italian cyclist Michele Scarponi has died aged 37 after being involved in a collision with a van during a training ride. A statement from his Astana team said the crash happened close to Scarponi's home in Filottrano. Scarponi won the 2011 Giro d'Italia after Alberto Contador was stripped of the title and claimed victory in stage one of the Tour of the Alps on Monday. ""This is a tragedy too big to be written,"" said the Astana statement. The statement described Scarponi as a ""great champion"" and a ""special guy"", adding: ""The Astana Pro Team clings to the Michele family in this incredibly painful moment of sorrow and mourning."" Scarponi leaves behind a wife and two children. After finishing fourth in the Tour of the Alps behind British winner Geraint Thomas on Friday, Scarponi returned home by car with his masseur before heading out for a ride on Saturday. Sorry, this content is no longer available. ""Devastated to hear the news about Scarponi. Can't believe it. My thoughts with all his friends, family and team,"" Thomas posted on Twitter. ""Terrible news to wake up to. One of the smiliest, happiest guys in the peleton. Rest in peace,"" said British cyclist Alex Dowsett. Spanish rider Contador said: ""Paralysed and speechless with the news about Scarponi. Great person and always with a contagious smile. Rest in peace, friend."" Astana team-mate and compatriot Fabio Aru said: ""Endless tragedy. There are no words. Rest in peace, my friend."" Specialist climber Scarponi turned professional in 2002 with the Acqua & Sapone-Cantina Tollo team, finishing 18th in his debut Giro d'Italia. In 2007 he was banned for 18 months after being implicated in Operation Puerto - a major Spanish doping scandal involving some of the world's top cyclists at the time. Scarponi admitted his involvement in the scandal but denied doping, having been charged with using or attempting to use banned substances and possession of those substances. Returning in November 2008, he won the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race in 2009 before initially finishing second in the 2011 Giro d'Italia. He was later awarded his first Grand Tour title after original winner Contador was stripped of his title by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2012 after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France. Scarponi was suspended for three months in 2012 by his then team Lampre for visiting doctor Michele Ferrari - who is banned for life by the US Anti-Doping Agency for his role in Lance Armstrong's doping programme. Following fourth-placed finishes at the Giro d'Italia in 2012 and 2013, Scarponi joined Astana in 2014, primarily riding Grand Tours as a domestique and helping team-mate Vincenzo Nibali to victory in the 2014 Tour de France and 2016 Giro d'Italia.

"Vietnamese villagers free police hostages Residents of a village in Vietnam have freed the remaining 19 hostages they were holding in a week-long stand-off over land rights. The release follows a meeting with the Hanoi police chief, who promised not to prosecute the villagers and to order a re-examination of local land use. In 2015 the land in question was allocated to a firm run by the Vietnamese military. Residents opposed the move, saying they had received inadequate compensation. Last Saturday, local residents of Dong Tam Commune, a village outside Hanoi, took 38 people captive in protest. The hostages included police officers and local officials. Some were released earlier this week.  The remaining 19 people were freed on Saturday after a Hanoi official, Nguyen Duc Chung, promised to launch an investigation which is due to conclude in 45 days. During the dispute, the villagers built barricades and blocked roads to keep police out and the situation intensified.  Local authorities earlier fled the village, leaving residents in control.  The land under dispute covers an area of 50 hectares (124 acres) that the defence ministry allocated to the military-run communications firm Viettel Group in 2015.  Local authorities said that the land had been set aside for a defence project. However, tensions began to rise when Viettel started clearing the land ahead of construction, with residents attempting to obstruct its efforts.  Disputes over land rights are common in Vietnam because the government does not recognise private land ownership.  Government agencies reserve the right to seize farmland for construction and investment projects. But it is rare for protesters to seize such a large number of officials.",Sunday 23 April 2017,23-Apr-17,Vietnamese villagers free police hostages,The remaining 19 people held captive are released following a week-long stand-off in a land dispute.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39682124
"Cassini probe heads towards Saturn 'grand finale' Cassini has used a gravitational slingshot around Saturn's moon Titan to put it on a path towards destruction.  Saturday's flyby swept the probe into an orbit that takes it in between the planet's rings and its atmosphere.  This gap-run gives the satellite the chance finally to work out the length of a day on Saturn, and to determine the age of its stunning rings.  But the manoeuvre means also that it cannot escape a fiery plunge into Saturn's clouds in September.  The US space agency (Nasa) is calling an end to 12 years of exploration and discovery at Saturn because the probe's propellant tanks are all but empty.  Controllers cannot risk an unresponsive satellite one day crashing into - and contaminating - the gas giant's potentially life-supporting moons, and so they have opted for a strategy that guarantees safe disposal.  ""If Cassini runs out of fuel it would be uncontrolled and the possibility that it could crash-land on the moons of Titan and/or Enceladus are unacceptably high,"" said Dr Earl Maize, Nasa's Cassini programme manager. ""We could put it into a very long orbit far from Saturn but the science return from that would be nowhere near as good as what we're about to do,"" he told BBC News.  Cassini has routinely used the strong gravitational field of Titan to adjust its trajectory.  In the years that it has been studying the Saturnian system, the probe has flown by the haze-shrouded world on 126 occasions - each time getting a kick that bends it towards a new region of interest.  And on Saturday, Cassini pulled on the gravitational ""elastic band"" one last time, to shift from an orbit that grazes the outer edge of Saturn's main ring system to a flight path that skims the inner edge and puts it less than 3,000km above the planet's cloud tops. The probe will make the first of these gap runs next Wednesday, repeating the dive every six and a half days through to its death plunge, scheduled to occur at about 10:45 GMT on 15 September.  Scientists used Saturday's pass of Titan to make some final close-up observations of the moon.  This extraordinary world is dominated at northern latitudes by great lakes and seas of liquid methane.  Cassini's radar was commanded once again to scan their depths and look for what have become known as ""magic islands"" - locations where nitrogen gas bubbles up from below to produce a transient bumpiness on the liquid surfaces.  Sorry, your device is unsupported. Tap To Progress Swipe to go back Tap To Progress Images: Nasa, Kongle Go back to start  This is a bitter-sweet moment for scientists. Titan has yielded so many discoveries, and although the probe will continue to encounter the moon in the coming months, it will never again get so close - less than 1,000km from ground level.  On the other hand, researchers have the prospect now of at last answering some thorny questions at Saturn itself.  These include the length of a day on the planet. Cassini so far has not been able to determine precisely the gas giant's internal rotation period.  From the close-in vantage afforded by the new orbit, this detail should become apparent.  ""We sort of know; it's about 10.5 hours,"" said Prof Michele Dougherty, the Cassini magnetometer principal investigator from Imperial College, London, UK. ""Depending on whether you're looking in the northern hemisphere or the southern hemisphere - it changes. And depending on whether you're looking in the summer or winter seasons - it changes as well.  ""So, there's clearly some atmospheric signal which we're measuring that's linked to weather and the seasons that's masking the interior of the planet,"" she told the BBC.  The other major outstanding question is the age of Saturn's rings.  By getting inside them, Cassini will be able to weigh the great bands of ice particles.  ""If the rings are a lot more massive than we expect, perhaps they're old - as old as Saturn itself; and they've been massive enough to survive the micrometeoroid bombardment and erosion and leave us with the rings we see today,"" conjectured Nasa project scientist Dr Linda Spilker.

"Vietnamese villagers free police hostages Residents of a village in Vietnam have freed the remaining 19 hostages they were holding in a week-long stand-off over land rights. The release follows a meeting with the Hanoi police chief, who promised not to prosecute the villagers and to order a re-examination of local land use. In 2015 the land in question was allocated to a firm run by the Vietnamese military. Residents opposed the move, saying they had received inadequate compensation. Last Saturday, local residents of Dong Tam Commune, a village outside Hanoi, took 38 people captive in protest. The hostages included police officers and local officials. Some were released earlier this week.  The remaining 19 people were freed on Saturday after a Hanoi official, Nguyen Duc Chung, promised to launch an investigation which is due to conclude in 45 days. During the dispute, the villagers built barricades and blocked roads to keep police out and the situation intensified.  Local authorities earlier fled the village, leaving residents in control.  The land under dispute covers an area of 50 hectares (124 acres) that the defence ministry allocated to the military-run communications firm Viettel Group in 2015.  Local authorities said that the land had been set aside for a defence project. However, tensions began to rise when Viettel started clearing the land ahead of construction, with residents attempting to obstruct its efforts.  Disputes over land rights are common in Vietnam because the government does not recognise private land ownership.  Government agencies reserve the right to seize farmland for construction and investment projects. But it is rare for protesters to seize such a large number of officials.",Sunday 23 April 2017,23-Apr-17,Vietnamese villagers free police hostages,The remaining 19 people held captive are released following a week-long stand-off in a land dispute.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39682124
"Cassini probe heads towards Saturn 'grand finale' Cassini has used a gravitational slingshot around Saturn's moon Titan to put it on a path towards destruction.  Saturday's flyby swept the probe into an orbit that takes it in between the planet's rings and its atmosphere.  This gap-run gives the satellite the chance finally to work out the length of a day on Saturn, and to determine the age of its stunning rings.  But the manoeuvre means also that it cannot escape a fiery plunge into Saturn's clouds in September.  The US space agency (Nasa) is calling an end to 12 years of exploration and discovery at Saturn because the probe's propellant tanks are all but empty.  Controllers cannot risk an unresponsive satellite one day crashing into - and contaminating - the gas giant's potentially life-supporting moons, and so they have opted for a strategy that guarantees safe disposal.  ""If Cassini runs out of fuel it would be uncontrolled and the possibility that it could crash-land on the moons of Titan and/or Enceladus are unacceptably high,"" said Dr Earl Maize, Nasa's Cassini programme manager. ""We could put it into a very long orbit far from Saturn but the science return from that would be nowhere near as good as what we're about to do,"" he told BBC News.  Cassini has routinely used the strong gravitational field of Titan to adjust its trajectory.  In the years that it has been studying the Saturnian system, the probe has flown by the haze-shrouded world on 126 occasions - each time getting a kick that bends it towards a new region of interest.  And on Saturday, Cassini pulled on the gravitational ""elastic band"" one last time, to shift from an orbit that grazes the outer edge of Saturn's main ring system to a flight path that skims the inner edge and puts it less than 3,000km above the planet's cloud tops. The probe will make the first of these gap runs next Wednesday, repeating the dive every six and a half days through to its death plunge, scheduled to occur at about 10:45 GMT on 15 September.  Scientists used Saturday's pass of Titan to make some final close-up observations of the moon.  This extraordinary world is dominated at northern latitudes by great lakes and seas of liquid methane.  Cassini's radar was commanded once again to scan their depths and look for what have become known as ""magic islands"" - locations where nitrogen gas bubbles up from below to produce a transient bumpiness on the liquid surfaces.  Sorry, your device is unsupported. Tap To Progress Swipe to go back Tap To Progress Images: Nasa, Kongle Go back to start  This is a bitter-sweet moment for scientists. Titan has yielded so many discoveries, and although the probe will continue to encounter the moon in the coming months, it will never again get so close - less than 1,000km from ground level.  On the other hand, researchers have the prospect now of at last answering some thorny questions at Saturn itself.  These include the length of a day on the planet. Cassini so far has not been able to determine precisely the gas giant's internal rotation period.  From the close-in vantage afforded by the new orbit, this detail should become apparent.  ""We sort of know; it's about 10.5 hours,"" said Prof Michele Dougherty, the Cassini magnetometer principal investigator from Imperial College, London, UK. ""Depending on whether you're looking in the northern hemisphere or the southern hemisphere - it changes. And depending on whether you're looking in the summer or winter seasons - it changes as well.  ""So, there's clearly some atmospheric signal which we're measuring that's linked to weather and the seasons that's masking the interior of the planet,"" she told the BBC.  The other major outstanding question is the age of Saturn's rings.  By getting inside them, Cassini will be able to weigh the great bands of ice particles.  ""If the rings are a lot more massive than we expect, perhaps they're old - as old as Saturn itself; and they've been massive enough to survive the micrometeoroid bombardment and erosion and leave us with the rings we see today,"" conjectured Nasa project scientist Dr Linda Spilker.  ""On the other hand, if the rings are less massive - they're very young, maybe forming as little as 100 million years ago.  ""Maybe a comet or a moon got too close, got torn apart by Saturn's gravity and that's how we have the rings we see today.""

"Paris Champs Elysees attack: 'Angry Police Wives' protest against violence More than 100 wives and partners of police have protested in Paris against attacks on police following the killing of an officer on the Champs Elysees. The Angry Police Wives group marched through the city two days after Xavier Jugelé was shot twice in the head by convicted criminal Karim Cheurfi. Separately, police fired tear gas amid confrontations after a trade union demonstration in eastern Paris calling for a ""social first round"" of voting. France goes to the polls on Sunday. In another incident, French media said a man with a knife had been arrested at the Gare du Nord station. Police have not said if the incident is terrorism-related. Candidates in the presidential election have been accused of exploiting the Champs Elysees attack politically. Two other officers were wounded before Cheurfi was shot dead.  The killer had spoken about wanting to kill police but had had no apparent link to Islamist radicalism before the attack, prosecutors said. A note defending so-called Islamic State (IS) was found near his body. At the end of the pro-police demonstration, marchers released black balloons signifying police killed in the line of duty and pink balloons for the families they left behind. Some were carrying placards saying ""don't touch my cop"", a twist on a well-known French anti-racism slogan. One placard also said ""enough police officers killed and burned"", referring not only to Mr Jugele's death but also a firebomb attack on a police car carrying four officers by suspected drug dealers in a poor suburb of Paris last October.  Two of the officers were seriously wounded in the attack. Police officers have also been hurt in recent protests over allegations of police brutality. Last month three officers were injured in protests after a Chinese man was shot dead by officers. In February protesters attacked a police station amid widespread anger over the alleged rape of a young black man by French police. Police officer Xavier Jugelé, 37, was an active campaigner for gay rights, French media report. He was in a civil partnership and did not have children. Originally from the Loire Valley region in central France, he had been serving in the capital since 2014, French daily Liberation writes (in French).  He was deployed on the night of the November 2015 attacks in Paris to the Bataclan concert hall, returning the following year on the night the venue reopened. The BBC's Nick Garnett interviewed him at the time. ""I want to celebrate life and say 'no' to terrorism,"" he told our reporter.

"General election 2017: PM says Tories are 'party of lower taxes' The Conservatives are ""a lower tax party"", Theresa May has insisted, amid speculation her party may raise taxes if they win the general election.  Speaking in Dudley, she said Labour's ""natural instinct"" was to raise tax. But the prime minister would not say whether she would keep her party's 2015 manifesto pledge of no rises in VAT, national insurance or income tax. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the government of planning ""a tax bombshell"". Liberal Democrat and former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said Mrs May was now ""at war"" with her Chancellor Philip Hammond over tax. Mr Hammond said on Friday there should be ""flexibility to manage the system"" of taxation. But Tory party sources have told the BBC that his comments were not a hint at plans to raise taxes in the upcoming Conservative manifesto. After her speech at the Netherton Conservative Club in Dudley, Mrs May was questioned by reporters about her tax plans.  ""At this election, people are going to have a very clear choice,"" she said.  ""They will have a choice between a Conservative party, which always has been, is and will continue to be a party that believes in lower taxes... [or] a Labour party whose natural instinct is always to raise taxes."" The prime minister said the choice was also between ""strong and stable leadership under a Conservative government"" or a ""weak and unstable coalition of chaos lead by Jeremy Corbyn"".   Mrs May also declined to guarantee existing spending on state pensions, which currently ensures a minimum 2.5% annual increase. Mr Hammond told the BBC's Kamal Ahmed: ""All chancellors would prefer to have more flexibility in how they manage the economy and how they manage the overall tax burden down [rather] than having to have their hands constrained. ""But what we put in the manifesto will be decided in the next few days and we will publish that."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the chancellor was facing a £2bn gap in his budget following the government's decision not to go through with an increase in the rate of National Insurance contributions for the self-employed. ""He's recognising he's got problems in the economy, he's got problems in the budgeting that he's done and as a result of that there will be tax rises under a Conservative government if they are re-elected.   ""This is quite a tax bombshell."" Sir Vince added that Mrs May needed to clarify her taxation plans and how she planned to ""fill the Brexit black hole"" in the budget.  ""Philip Hammond admitted yesterday that taxes would have to rise, no doubt due to Theresa May's hard Brexit that could leave anything up to a £100bn Brexit black hole in the public finances,"" he said.  ""Theresa May should come clean on how she intends to fill the Brexit black hole if she won't increase taxes.""",Sunday 23 April 2017,23-Apr-17,"UK Tories party of lower taxes, says May",Theresa May says Labour wants to raise taxes - but does not commit to previous Tory pledges.,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39678863
"Kenya election: Kenyatta blames primaries chaos on turnout Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has blamed huge voter turnout for the chaos at his party's primaries on Friday, which led to them being cancelled.  In many areas across the country, there were delays, with some skirmishes also reported as contestants accused their opponents of rigging.  Mr Kenyatta admitted to reporters that not enough election materials had been provided.  The primaries are in preparation for August's national poll. The election will take place nearly a decade after disputed election results fuelled violence that left more than 1,000 dead and 500,000 displaced. However elections in 2013 passed off relatively peacefully. Mr Kenyatta said his Jubilee Party had underestimated the number of people who would turn out for the nominations. ""Let us avoid pointing fingers,"" he said in a series of tweets. Mr Kenyatta called on voters and contestants to be patient as the party prepared to repeat the vote in the affected areas. The Jubilee party was holding primaries in 21 out of the 47 counties on Friday, most of them party strongholds. Nominations in the capital Nairobi had already been pushed back to Monday. The remaining counties will nominate their candidates on Tuesday. Parties must hold their primaries by Wednesday, the election authorities have said. Last week, similar polls for the opposition Orange Democratic Movement led by former Prime Minister Raila Odinga witnessed violence, particularly in the western Kenya region. Mr Kenyatta is seeking a second term in office. He is being opposed by a coalition of opposition parties known as the National Super Alliance, which is expected to announce its presidential candidate next week.",Sunday 23 April 2017,23-Apr-17,'Too many voters' cause Kenya poll chaos,President Kenyatta admits not enough election materials were provided for his party's primaries.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39679089
"France elections: Macron and Le Pen through to run-off The centrist Emmanuel Macron will face far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a run-off for the French presidency on 7 May, near-final results show. With 96% of votes counted from Sunday's first round, Mr Macron has 23.9% with Ms Le Pen on 21.4%. Opinion polls have consistently predicted Mr Macron defeating his rival in the run-off. The two fought off a strong challenge from centre-right François Fillon and hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Whoever wins the second round, the voting marks a shift away from the decades-long dominance of leftist and centre-right parties in French politics. While Ms Le Pen has long been seen as likely to make the second round, Emmanuel Macron's rise has been swift. The BBC's Hugh Schofield says Mr Macron's likely victory is the story of the evening. He told cheering supporters ""we have changed the face of French political life in one year"", calling for people to rally against ""nationalists"". A former banker, Mr Macron served as economy minister under current President Francois Hollande, quitting to launch a new party. He has never stood for election before and if he wins would become France's youngest-ever president. A pro-European, he has called for gradual deregulation of France's economy and a multi-billion dollar public investment plan. As the results came in, Ms Le Pen called herself ""the candidate for the people"", saying that the ""survival of France"" was at stake. ""The first step... has been taken,"" she said. ""This result is historic."" Ms Le Pen leads the Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant National Front party. She has attempted to soften the party's tone and brought big gains in the 2015 regional elections. She has urged a shake-up of France's relations with the EU, calling for negotiations followed by a referendum. Ms Le Pen also wants immigration to be slashed and the closure of ""extremist"" mosques. At times, Emmanuel Macron's campaign HQ felt like an extremely polite rave.  During the long wait for the candidate to come and speak, loudspeakers played techno music. Volunteers holding French flags swayed; some chanted ""Macron President"". Most crammed towards the front to get a better look at their candidate.  Mr Macron himself came to cheers. But the campaign supporters inside the arena were not his main audience.  His victory speech was a pre-presidential address, directed towards the rest of the country that did not vote for him. He was sober, sombre, and emotional only when he spoke of his wife's support.  After he left, the crowd drifted away. The DJ played Michael Jackson and Earth, Wind & Fire. In the street at night, as I waited to head back into central Paris, I saw no celebrations, no-one honking their car horns. There is still a second round to fight. Mr Macron is widely seen as favourite in the final round of voting, and in a sign of the uphill struggle Ms Le Pen faces he soon won high-profile endorsements.  Admitting defeat, François Fillon, whose campaign was rocked by corruption allegations, said there was ""no other choice"" but to vote for Mr Macron. He polled about 20%, slightly ahead of Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Benoit Hamon, the candidate of President Hollande's Socialist Party said ""I encourage everyone to fight as hard as they can to fight the extreme right, and to fight for Macron"".  He endured a difficult night, polling only just over 6%. Both Germany and the EU also offered praise for Mr Macron. Turnout nationally appears to be similar to the last election in 2012, at about 80%. Almost 47 million people were eligible to vote. Nearly 60,000 police and soldiers were deployed across the country to secure polling, with France still reeling from the shooting of a policeman on the Champs Elysees.

"North Korea 'detains American citizen' An American citizen has been detained in North Korea as he tried to leave the country, South Korean media say. The man was identified only by his surname, Kim.  He becomes the third American to be detained by the North; one has been sentenced for spying, the other for trying to steal a sign from a hotel. The latest detention comes amid high tension on the peninsula, with the US warning its ""strategic patience"" on the North's nuclear programme is over. A US naval battle group headed by an aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, and described by President Donald Trump as an ""armada"", is expected to reach the Korean peninsula later in the week. The South Korean news agency Yonhap said the detained American citizen, in his 50s, was a former professor from Yanbian University in China and had been in North Korea for a month in connection with relief programmes. He was arrested at Pyongyang International Airport, Yonhap said. In January last year, US student Otto Warmbier, 21, was arrested for trying to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel while visiting North Korea. He was given 15 years' hard labour for crimes against the state in March 2016. In April last year, Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, was sentenced to 10 years' hard labour for spying. He had been arrested the previous October. The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns. After the brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was murdered recently in Malaysia, Malaysian citizens in Pyongyang were not allowed to leave the country until North Koreans suspected of the murder were released in Kuala Lumpur. Tension remains high on the peninsula following the North's recent failed missile test and massive military parade showing off its latest hardware. North Korea has said it is ready to sink the Carl Vinson, and on Sunday said it would strike Australia with nuclear weapons if it remained an ally of the United States. North Korea's aim is to develop nuclear weapons small enough to put on ballistic missiles, but there is no evidence yet it has done so, or that it has missiles with the range to reach long-distance targets. This week US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a tour of Asian nations, said the US was ""reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang"". North Korean media responded by warning of an unspecified ""super-mighty pre-emptive strike"".",Monday 24 April 2017,24-Apr-17,North Korea 'detains American citizen',The detention of a third US man comes amid heightened tension on the peninsula.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39683518

"Aurora photographers find new night sky lights and call them Steve A group of aurora enthusiasts have found a new type of light in the night sky and named it Steve. Eric Donovan from the University of Calgary in Canada spotted the feature in photos shared on a Facebook group. He did not recognise it as a catalogued phenomenon and although the group were calling it a proton arc, he knew proton auroras were not visible. Testing showed it appeared to be a hot stream of fast-flowing gas in the higher reaches of the atmosphere. The European Space Agency (ESA) sent electric field instruments to measure it 300km (190 miles) above the surface of the Earth and found the temperature of the air was 3,000C (5,400F) hotter inside the gas stream than outside it. Inside, the 25km-wide ribbon of gas was flowing at 6 km/s (13,000mph), 600 times faster than the air on either side. Relatively little else is known about the big purple light as yet but it appears it is not an aurora as it does not stem from the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's magnetic field. There are reports that the group called it Steve in homage to a 2006 children's film, Over the Hedge, where the characters give the name to a creature they have not seen before. Roger Haagmans of the ESA said: ""It is amazing how a beautiful natural phenomenon, seen by observant citizens, can trigger scientists' curiosity. ""It turns out that Steve is actually remarkably common, but we hadn't noticed it before.

"Real Madrid 2-3 Barcelona By Alex Bysouth BBC Sport Lionel Messi scored his 500th Barcelona goal to send them top of La Liga with an injury-time winner against 10-man Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. Barca, whose win put them top because of a better head-to-head record, have five games left, Real have six to play. Casemiro scored first for the hosts before Messi and Ivan Rakitic put Barcelona in front and Sergio Ramos was shown a red card for a wild lunge.  Substitute James Rodriguez thought he had earned Madrid a point late on. But Messi, who scored his first with a superb jinking run and finish, fired in from the edge of the area to win it for Barcelona. Both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo had earlier missed good opportunities to give their sides the lead, with the Argentina international poking wide of an open goal before the break and the Real Madrid forward slicing over in the second half. Real - who have a game in hand on Barcelona - also felt they should have had a penalty when Ronaldo was clipped by Samuel Umtiti after only two minutes.  Reaching the Champions League quarter-finals and competing to win La Liga would hardly constitute a crisis for most clubs, but this is Barcelona. Trophies are often the minimum requirement for those in charge at Camp Nou. Fans expect to see their side win in style and have questioned the merits of boss Luis Enrique, who is to leave at the end of the season. The travelling Catalan contingent could not complain about Sunday's heroics, however, as they were treated to two fine finishes from Messi that were complemented by an equally composed Rakitic strike from the edge of the area. Any crisis talks can be postponed while this side continues to boast Messi in its ranks, with the little magician showing he still has the ability to carry the Blaugrana against the world's best teams. A genius with the football at his feet, Messi continued to be the creative spark for Barcelona even after Casemiro - lucky not to be sent off himself - had twice scythed the forward down and an innocuous Marcelo elbow left the Argentine with a bloodied mouth. His reward, as well as outshining Real Madrid counterpart Ronaldo in this Clasico, was to further ingrain his name into Barcelona folklore. Real Madrid have won the Champions League in two of the past three seasons, but have been less successful domestically - they are without a La Liga title since 2012, with Barcelona taking the trophy three times and Atletico Madrid once since then. Down to 10 men after Ramos' sending off and having pulled level with five minutes to spare, Zinedine Zidane's outfit looked intent on a winner that would have effectively put the title beyond Barcelona. That left the space for the visitors to break away and score themselves. Tactical naivety from Zidane? Perhaps, but with a game in hand, La Liga still looks Real's to lose. It had started promisingly for the hosts, with Casemiro the unlikely early hero when he poked home after Ramos hit the post. However, when Gareth Bale limped off with an ankle problem, the momentum swung in Barcelona's favour. Has the momentum in the title race also shifted away from Los Merengues? If Zidane's side, who remain on course to become the first team to secure back-to-back Champions Leagues, can win their remaining six games in La Liga, the Frenchman will end Madrid's five-year wait for the domestic title. Even with Brazil international Neymar suspended for Barcelona and Bale going off injured in the first half for Madrid, both sides boasted a plethora of attacking talent at the Bernabeu. But it was the goalkeepers who looked, for a long time, to have come out on top as Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Keylor Navas made a series of fine saves to keep the score down. Barcelona's Ter Stegen was equal to efforts from Ronaldo and Karim Benzema in the first half, before Paco Alcacer, Gerard Pique and Luis Suarez were all denied by Navas after the break. Ter Stegen made 12 saves in total, the most by a Barcelona keeper in La Liga since the 2003-04 season, but had little chance with either Casemiro's opener or Rodriguez's late leveller. Eventually Barcelona's class in attack also shone through, La Liga's top goalscorer Messi leaving Navas well beaten with the winner.  Barcelona boss Luis Enrique: ""We are first now but Madrid have an extra game. It will be tight until the end. We got the result we came here for. ""This is a season that weighs on us like five. So many things have happened, good things, not so good things, things I've already forgotten.  ""The 2-2 goal was a terrible blow but players were able to come back in the last breath - the happy ending that we all wanted at Barcelona.""  Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane: ""Nothing changes now. Maybe after today the league will be more open. But we still depend on ourselves.""

"Italy migrant crisis: Charities 'colluding' with smugglers An Italian prosecutor says he has evidence some of the charities saving migrants in the Mediterranean Sea are colluding with people-smugglers. Carmelo Zuccaro told La Stampa (in Italian) phone calls were being made from Libya to rescue vessels. Organisations involved in rescue operations have rejected accusations of collusion, saying their only concern is to save lives. Italy is the main route for migrants trying to reach Europe. Almost 1,000 people are thought to have drowned in waters between Libya and Italy this year, according to the UN refugee agency. Nearly 37,000 people have been rescued over the same period, a surge of more than 40% from last year, the figures say.  ""We have evidence that there are direct contacts between certain NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and people traffickers in Libya,"" Mr Zuccaro is quoted as saying in La Stampa. He said that telephone calls were being made from Libya and rescuers were shining lamps to direct smugglers' vessels and turning off transponders so boats could not be traced. But he did not say he would open a criminal investigation. Mr Zuccaro's comments come amid growing criticism of NGO activity in the Mediterranean, including one leading politician saying it was tantamount to providing a taxi service to Europe. But Chris Catrambone, who co-founded the Migrant Offshore Aid Station NGO to rescue migrants, told Reuters news agency ""more would die if we weren't there"".

"Parents' mobile use harms family life, say secondary pupils An overuse of mobile phones by parents disrupts family life, according to a survey of secondary pupils.  More than a third of 2,000 11 to 18-year-olds who responded to a poll said they had asked their parents to stop checking their devices.  And 14% said their parents were online at meal times, although 95% of 3,000 parents, polled separately, denied it.  The research was carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference.  Among the pupils:  Of pupils who had asked their parents to put down their phones, 46% said their parents took no notice while 44% felt upset and ignored. Despite this, only a minority of parents (10%) believed their mobile use was a concern for their children - although almost half (43%) felt they spent too much of their own time online:  Research last year by DAUK and HMC showed almost half of secondary pupils were checking their mobile phones after they had gone to bed, amid warnings that they were arriving at school tired and unable to concentrate.  According to the new research, almost three-quarters of pupils (72%) said they were online between three and 10 hours a day - but for 11% this could rise to 15 hours at weekends and holidays and 3% said it could reach 20 hours.  And children's greatest worry about their own online use was lack of sleep, with 47% highlighting it as a major concern.  But among parents, only 10% worried about children's time online leading to sleep deprivation.  Mike Buchanan, headmaster of Ashford School in Kent and chairman of the HMC, which represents leading private schools, said it was time for parents, teachers and pupils ""to rewrite the rulebook"" on mobile devices, which ""have become an integral part of life at school, work and play"".  ""Our poll shows that children are aware of many of the risks associated with overuse of technology but they need the adults in their lives to set clear boundaries and role model sensible behaviour. ""To achieve this, we need to join up the dots between school and home and give consistent advice,"" said Mr Buchanan. Emma Robertson, co-founder of DAUK, said too few parents knew how long their children were online, particularly at night, ""or what they are actually doing online"". ""We hope these findings will be a wake-up call for families and motivate them to have serious conversations about the safe and healthy use of technology,"" she said. The research comes ahead of the HMC's spring conference, which will explore new ways of working between schools and families in both the state and independent sectors.   Parents and pupils at a leading academy chain, which runs both state and private schools in England, were invited to take part in the research earlier this month.

"Colombia's ELN loses kidnap victim in jungle escape Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, the ELN, says a Russian-Armenian wildlife trafficker whom they had been holding for ransom has escaped.  The group said it had found Voskanya Arcen Levoni  six months ago in the jungle region of Choco province collecting poisonous frogs.     The ELN stated it had begun negotiations for his release with the Russian Embassy. But, it said, Mr Arcen Levoni had overcome his guards and escaped. The ELN said the escape happened when the unit holding him had been transferring him.   During the struggle he had wounded five ELN fighters and then fled into the jungle, himself badly hurt. ""The ELN units withdrew their wounded and have no knowledge of the situation of the man they were transferring to be released."" It said. The group had sworn to suspend their kidnapping operations as a precondition of peace talks with the government which began in February.  The ELN is the last left-wing guerrilla group active in Colombia, following the peace accord in November between the government and the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).

"General election 2017: Tony Blair says Brexit stance more important than party Tony Blair has urged voters not to elect MPs who ""back Brexit at any cost"", whichever party they are from.  The ex-PM told the BBC that Brexit was a bigger issue than party allegiance for the general election on 8 June.  He said the Tories were likely to win but a big Labour vote could constrain the PM, whose ""unreasonable"" policy was being driven by her party's right wing. And he said he felt so passionately about Brexit he was ""almost motivated"" to re-enter British politics himself. Mr Blair stepped down from frontline politics in 2007 but has become more politically active in recent months, setting up a think tank in London to make the case for the centre ground and for continued EU membership. He told the BBC that the opinion polls suggested Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives were on course for a landslide victory and he ""wasn't totally sure"" what Labour's position was on Brexit. Speaking to Radio 4's World This Weekend, he said that voters need to know where candidates stood on leaving the EU. He described Theresa May as ""very sensible"" and ""a perfectly decent person"" but said her policy on leaving the EU was ""not reasonable"" and that it was driven by the right wing of her party.  He said: ""The point is whether I'm Labour or I'm not Labour - even if there's Conservatives or Liberal Democrats - I will work with anyone to get this argument across in the country."" He pledged to put pressure on candidates in each constituency to force them to declare where they stood on the mandate Mrs May should have when negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from the EU.   And he said he was supporting a campaign, also backed by anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, to fund candidates who want to see another, ""final"" vote on the exit deal.   Mr Blair said he feared that winning a large majority would effectively hand Theresa May ""a blank cheque for Brexit at any costs"", which was not in the interests of the country.  Although he has previously ruled out standing for Parliament again after an absence of 10 years, Mr Blair said: ""I look at the British political scene at the moment and I actually almost feel motivated to go right back into it,"" he added.

"Kuki Gallmann shot and wounded at Kenya conservation park Renowned Italian-born conservationist Kuki Gallmann has been shot and injured in an ambush at her conservation park in central Kenya. The author of the best-selling memoir I Dreamed of Africa was airlifted to hospital for treatment. Ms Gallmann, 73, owns the Laikipia Nature Conservancy. She also ran a luxury safari lodge that was burned down last month by suspected cattle herders, who have been in conflict with landowners. Herders have been invading private property in search of fresh grazing in the drought-stricken Laikipia region. British rancher Tristan Voorspuy, who also ran a safari company, was shot dead in early March while inspecting his lodges in Laikipia. Are Kenya ranch invasions driven by drought or politics? There is no confirmation of who carried out the attack on Ms Gallmann, who was reportedly shot in the stomach. She was flown by helicopter to hospital in Nairobi to undergo treatment. Ms Gallmann owns about 360 sq km in Laikipia, which is home to rare wildlife, birds and trees. Her organisation also runs community, education, arts and sports projects. She moved to Kenya in 1972 with her husband and son who both later died in separate accidents. She later became a Kenyan citizen. I Dreamed of Africa was turned into a film starring Kim Basinger. The arson attack on Ms Gallmann's Mukutan Retreat last month left it in ruins. There were no visitors staying at the time. Police believed that attack may have been in retaliation for a police operation that killed 100 cattle in the conservancy. The herders accused police of trying to force them off the land by shooting their livestock. Police say the livestock were killed in crossfire with the herders, who were using the animals as shields. Laikipia, which covers about 10,000 sq km in Kenya's central highlands, is where some of the country's largest white landowners are based.  Insecurity has risen sharply in recent months as the drought has led armed herders to seek out new pasture, pitting them against big landowners and smallholders.  Tens of thousands of cattle are thought to have been driven on to private land and at least a dozen people have been killed.

"Germany AfD: Right-wing party picks election leaders Germany's right-wing, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has picked a new team to lead it into September's general election. AfD co-founder Alexander Gauland, 76, and 38-year-old economist Alice Weidel will jointly head the campaign. The party's current co-leader and public face of the party, Frauke Petry, has announced she will not take part. She suffered a blow on Saturday attempting to set the AfD on a more moderate course. Ms Petry had wanted the AfD to seek coalition with other parties and reject extremist views but delegates at the party congress in Cologne refused to even debate her motion. Saturday also saw violent skirmishes between police and some of the 15,000 protesters who had gathered outside the congress. Founded in 2013, the AfD rose on a wave of opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 open-door policy to refugees. The party is seeking to enter the national parliament for the first time in September's vote, but opinion polls suggest a sharp drop in the AfD's popularity. As well as backing Mr Gauland and Ms Weidel, delegates also approved the party's election programme.  It includes a call to declare Islam incompatible with German culture and plans to strip immigrants convicted of serious crimes of their German passports. Mr Gauland is seen as a supporter of senior AfD figure Bjoern Hoecke, who caused outrage this year by calling the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a ""memorial of shame"". Mr Gauland himself provoked controversy by saying last year that Germans would not want a black German footballer as a neighbour. He later said the comments reflected his own views.",Monday 24 April 2017,24-Apr-17,German right-wingers pick election team,"Facing a slump in popularity, the AfD is seeking to enter national parliament for the first time.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39686081
"Happy Days actress Erin Moran dies at 56 US actress Erin Moran, best known for playing Joanie in 1970s sitcom Happy Days, has died, aged 56.  Police said an emergency team in Indiana responded to a call on Saturday afternoon and found her dead.  The cause is not yet known.  Moran also starred in the show's spin-off series Joanie Loves Chachi, which began in 1982. She played Joanie Cunningham, the younger sister of lead character Richie. Richie was played by Ron Howard, who has been among those posting the first tributes online.  Henry Winkler, who played The Fonz in the series, also shared condolences on Twitter. Moran joined the Happy Days cast in 1974 when she was 13.   She also made appearances in Murder She Wrote and The Waltons.   In recent years, she was reported to be living in an Indiana trailer park. In 2010, she joined various Happy Days co-stars in filing a lawsuit against television network CBS, claiming they were owed money from merchandising revenues.

"Bomb left outside Ardoyne school was designed to kill officers, say police Police have said a bomb which was left outside the gates of a primary school in north Belfast could have killed or seriously injured. It was discovered by a passing police patrol near Holy Cross Boys' Primary School in Ardoyne in the early hours of Sunday morning.  Ch Supt Chris Noble said the device was ""sizeable"" and an attempt by dissident republicans to kill police officers.  He said the lives of the local community had also been put at risk. ""There's no doubt that device was there to try and kill community police officers on the beat in their local area but also it was left in such a reckless manner and in such a reckless location that it would undoubtedly have led to the death or serious injury of a member of the public had it exploded anywhere near them,"" he said.  ""This is an attempt, we believe, by violent dissident republicans to kill police officers but it was also very much an ""anti-community act"" as well, in terms of where it was located and the way in which it was left."" About 20 residents had to leave their homes during the security operation and were given shelter in a nearby community centre.  The senior officer said they included ""very distressed young children"" as well as elderly residents and people with ""significant disabilities"".  They have since been allowed to return home. The chairman of the NI Police Federation Mark Lindsay, said the attackers wanted to murder or maim officers.  ""They didn't care if passers-by or children out playing in the area were caught up in an explosion. It was an entirely reckless act,"" he said. ""This appears to have been a deadly, anti-personnel-type weapon. Thankfully, it was recovered and removed without being detonated.  ""The attackers are terrorising people who live in the area and preventing them from getting on with their everyday lives."" Northern Ireland Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, said: ""I am sickened by this incident with dissident republican terrorists placing a bomb close to a primary school in north Belfast.  ""This shows their wanton disregard for human life, potentially putting children in danger.  ""The consequences could have been utterly devastating and it shows them for what they really are."" North Belfast MP, Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said: ""Those who constructed and planted this device clearly have no regard for any human life.  ""Such a device could have caused devastation and we must all pay tribute to the work of those who have made the scene safe."" The Sinn Féin North Belfast MLA, Gerry Kelly, also condemned those who had left the bomb in the area. ""Those who are involved in this need to get off the people's backs and they need to go away,"" he said.  ""The message is as simple and straightforward as that, we could have been dealing with death here, thankfully, we're not.""   SDLP councillor Paul McCusker said the incident had caused distress to those living in the area. ""In total there were over 20 homes evacuated,"" he said.  ""One young girl, a six-year-old, you could see the fear when you were speaking to her and she said [was] woken up by her mum and had to leave the house.  ""She told me she actually thought she was dreaming and her and her mum were very frightened."" The chair of the Policing Board, Anne Connolly, urged witnesses to help detectives track down those responsible.

""I'm grateful that the device was found and the attempt to harm our police officers thwarted.""

"France elections: Le Pen steps aside as National Front leader Far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has announced that she is stepping aside as leader of her National Front (FN) party. The move comes just a day after she reached the second round of the French election, where she will face centrist Emmanuel Macron.  Ms Le Pen told French TV she needed to be above partisan considerations. Opinion polls suggest Mr Macron is firm favourite for the second round but Ms Le Pen said: ""We can win, we will win."" The French term she used signalled that the move to step aside would be temporary. She told France 2 that France was approaching a ""decisive moment"". Ms Le Pen said her decision had been made out of the ""profound conviction"" that the president must bring together all of the French people. ""So, this evening, I am no longer the president of the National Front. I am the candidate for the French presidency,"" she said. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says this is a symbolic act intended to show her concerns are for the country as a whole and not for her party, and that she is reaching out for the voters of candidates defeated in the first round, particularly those of the Republicans' François Fillon. Meanwhile, also on Monday, Mr Fillon told party leaders that he ""no longer had the legitimacy"" to take the party into legislative elections that will follow next month's presidential run-off. He said he would become ""an ordinary activist like any other"". %  Emmanuel  Macron  %  Marine  Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart. The polling average line  looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower. Ms Le Pen took over the FN leadership from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in January 2011. Marine Le Pen has gone straight on to the attack. If the polls are to be believed, she has a lot of ground to make up - and she wants to hit Emmanuel Macron hard and early. The ideological battle lines are clear. From now until 7 May, she will portray her rival as representing a kind of anti-France. Nothing in his programme, she said in her TV interview, suggested he had one iota of love for France; she, by contrast, is the patriot. The other line of attack is to play up his past associations with President François Hollande. Mr Macron is ""Hollande's baby"", she said in the interview. This is clever politics, because the same argument was used before the first round by François Fillon's Republicans, whose votes she now needs. If Mr Macron was unacceptable then, she is saying, then he is still unacceptable now. So vote for me. She won 7.6 million votes on Sunday - the strongest ever result for a FN candidate, and 2.8 million more than her father won in 2002. Her party wants to slash immigration, clamp down on trade, and overturn France's relationship with Europe. Her campaign has called for: Mr Macron, a former economy minister, is widely expected to win the run-off vote on 7 May. On Monday, he won the backing of President Hollande, to go with that of two defeated candidates. President Hollande said the far right would threaten the break-up of Europe, ""profoundly divide France"" and ""faced with such a risk, I will vote for Emmanuel Macron"". He said his former economy minister would ""defend the values which will bring French people together"". Mr Fillon and Socialist Benoît Hamon both urged their supporters to vote for Mr Macron.

"North Korea nuclear: White House calls Senate to briefing In an unusual move, the entire US Senate is being called to the White House for a briefing on North Korea.  Washington has become increasingly concerned at North Korean missile and nuclear tests and threats to its neighbours and the US.  The briefing, involving 100 senators as well as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defence Secretary James Mattis, is being held on Wednesday.  China, North Korea's main ally, has called for restraint from all sides.  China's call came in a phone conversation between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump on Sunday.  Mr Xi urged all parties to ""maintain restraint and avoid actions that would increase tensions"", according to the Chinese foreign ministry. Why Beijing should lead on North Korean crisis For his part, Mr Trump said North Korea's ""continued belligerence"" was destabilising the Korean peninsula.  White House officials regularly go to Congress to brief on national security matters, but it is unusual for the whole Senate to go to the White House.  Alongside Mr Tillerson and Gen Mattis will be National Intelligence Director Dan Coats and Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Questioned by reporters at his regular briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer referred further inquiries to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Aides, quoted by Reuters, say the House of Representatives is seeking a similar briefing on North Korea.  Washington says a flotilla, led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, is expected to arrive off the peninsula within days, despite conflicting messages last week on its exact whereabouts. Mr Trump has also told United Nations Security Council ambassadors, meeting at the White House, that the UN must be ready to impose new sanctions on North Korea.  The US is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to make its point on North Korea, the BBC's Gary O'Donoghue in Washington says.  First it wants the UN to tighten sanctions even further, and to ensure those in place are properly enforced.  Secondly, it is attempting to put fresh pressure on China to rein in its communist neighbour. The third aspect is the sending of an aircraft carrier to the Korean peninsula - making clear military action is an option. North Korean state media said on Sunday the country's forces were ""combat-ready to sink"" the Carl Vinson.  The ruling Workers' Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun called the carrier a ""gross animal"".  North Korea has promised to press ahead with missile tests despite Mr Trump's warnings and experts say it may be preparing for another nuclear test, in defiance of UN resolutions. However, a North Korean ballistic missile test on 16 April failed within seconds of launch, US experts said.  Washington is concerned that Pyongyang may develop the ability to place a nuclear bomb on a missile capable of reaching the US.  Beijing is worried about the possibility of all-out conflict on the peninsula, which could lead to the collapse of the North Korean regime under its mercurial leader Kim Jong-un.  China fears this could cause a sizeable refugee problem and lead to an American presence up to the Chinese border.

"Ontario to try giving poor a basic income Canada's largest province is experimenting with giving poor people a basic income with no strings attached. The three-year study will test whether this basic income is better than current social welfare programmes.  Randomly selected participants living in three communities in Ontario will be given at least C$16,989 ($12,600, £9,850) a year to live on. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said it is time to be ""bold"" in figuring out how to help society's most vulnerable. ""This is no time to retreat, this is no time for government to cling to the status quo,"" she said when the pilot was announced on Monday.  Ontario is not the only one trying this policy out.  Finland recently launched its own trial in January, and the Scottish government has expressed interest.  The idea is popular with both progressives and libertarians alike because it has the potential to reduce poverty and cut out red tape. Ontario's pilot project will roll out in Hamilton and Thunder Bay this spring, and Lindsay this fall.  The program will cost C$50m a year, and will include 4,000 households from across those three communities. Participants must have lived in one of the areas for over a year, be between 18-64 and be living on a lower income. Single adults will be given a yearly income of C$16,989, while couples will earn C$24,027, minus 50% of any income earned from a job.  By allowing people to keep part of their earnings, the government hopes people will be encouraged to work and not rely solely on assistance.

"US government shutdown: How did we get here? Outside observers could be forgiven for being a little mystified at news that the US government has shut down. So what is going on and how did we get here? It's when parts of the US government close until the government can decide on spending plans. Many federal agencies close down, so that potentially hundreds of thousands of government employees have to take a leave of absence, often without pay. Services such as national security, electricity generation and air traffic control continue, but others considered non-essential, like visa and passport processing, could be delayed. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said that over 50% of his department would not go to work, and some of the military's maintenance, training and intelligence operations would come to a halt. The Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open. When they closed during the 2013 shutdown there was an angry public reaction. A spending bill - called an appropriations bill in US political parlance - had to be passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump by midnight on Friday 19 January. This did not happen, and without an agreement on spending the federal government effectively closes its doors. As ever in politics, that depends on your point of view. Republicans are labelling it the Schumer shutdown, blaming Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who led the Democrats to block the bill. But Democrats say they had a deal on immigration - a major sticking point - before the president backed out. Correspondents say the winner of the blame game has yet to be decided, but the Republicans are going into the fight with lower popularity. Yes. The US government has closed for business several times before. The most recent shutdown lasted 16 days in 2013, when Republicans demanded the spending bill have provisions to impede or delay President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. National monuments and parks were closed and hundreds of thousands of government workers put on unpaid leave. Only one person was left to patrol the 5,525 mile (8,891km) border with Canada. But this is the first time since 1980 that a budget impasse has led to a shutdown when both chambers of Congress and the White House are controlled by the same party - the Republicans.  Hopes for a long-term spending bill, funding the US government for the entire 2018 budget year that ends in October, have long since vanished.  The measure that failed to pass on Friday evening would have kept Washington running until 16 February, and then the whole showdown would have resumed all over again. It was crafted by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate and included a few sweeteners to make it easier to vote for (and more difficult to vote against).  Several unpopular healthcare taxes were suspended in this bill. They also offered full re-authorisation for six years of the Children's Health Insurance Programme (Chip), which provides coverage for low-income families but is on the verge of running out of funds. But these sweeteners were not sweet enough, and the bill failed to pass. On Wednesday the Republican game plan seemed clear.  Pass the temporary funding, with the sweeteners, over unanimous Democratic opposition in the House of Representatives. Then essentially dare Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, denying money for poor children and forcing a shutdown.  The ground beneath the party began to crack on Thursday, however.  The president tweeted that he didn't support the inclusion of Chip funding in the stopgap bill, forcing a White House scramble to explain that Mr Trump still backed the legislation.  The House of Representatives passed the bill, but a handful of Republicans in the Senate said they would vote no.  And the Senate Democrats announced they had enough votes on their own to block passage. Ultimately, the bill failed by a margin of 50-49, well short of the 60 votes required. Take your pick: The presences (or absence) of any of the above could all have been reasons for legislators to go from yes to no. Mr Trump has called for a ""nuclear option"" of lowering the number of votes required to pass. An absolute majority (51%) would be easier for the Republicans to reach than the current 60% threshold. This would need to be led by Mr McConnell, but he has said he and other Republicans are opposed to it. A bipartisan group of 20 senators has met to try and reach a compromise, and some sound optimistic ahead of a vote due to be held on Monday.",Tuesday 25 April 2017,25-Apr-17,Will US government shut down over wall?,The US is days away from a potential government shutdown.

"Happy Days actress Erin Moran 'died from cancer' at 56 US actress Erin Moran, best known for playing Joanie in 1970s sitcom Happy Days, ""likely"" died from cancer at age 56, according to a county coroner. An autopsy reveals that her death was probably due to complications from stage four cancer. Police say there were no ""illegal narcotics found"" in her Indiana home. Moran also starred in the show's spin-off series Joanie Loves Chachi, which began in 1982. She had fallen on hard times in recent years, US media report. A joint statement by the Harrison County Sheriff's Department and the coroner's office said an autopsy revealed that she ""likely succumbed to complications of Stage 4 cancer"". ""Standard toxicology tests were performed and the results are pending however no illegal narcotics were found at the residence,"" the statement continued. She played Joanie Cunningham, the younger sister of lead character Richie. Tributes were paid by Happy Days co-stars, including Ron Howard who recalled her ""lighting up TV screens"". Moran joined the Happy Days cast in 1974 when she was 13, and made appearances in Murder She Wrote and The Waltons.   In 2010 she was reported to be living in an Indiana trailer park with the mother of her second husband, an employee of Walmart. She moved there after losing her California home to foreclosure. In 2010, she joined various Happy Days co-stars in filing a lawsuit against television network CBS, claiming they were owed money from merchandising revenues.  The suit was settled in 2012, with the actors each receiving a payout of $65,000 (£50,000).  They originally asked for $10m. Moran had been seen outside motels in southern Indiana, after reportedly spending all of her settlement money, and eventually becoming homeless.

"Arkansas executes murderers Jack Jones and Marcel Williams The state of Arkansas has executed two prisoners on death row after the US Supreme Court rejected their last-minute appeals.  Jack Jones and Marcel Williams were both sentenced to death for rapes and murders committed in the 1990s. Arkansas controversially scheduled eight sudden executions when it found out its supply of a drug used in lethal injections expires in late April.  It is the first double execution on the same day in the US for 17 years.  The state's decision to plan eight executions in just 11 days was prompted by the realisation that its stockpile of midazolam - one of three drugs used together in lethal injections - would expire at the end of the month. Human rights groups, defence lawyers, and drug companies all objected to the decision. But on Thursday, Ledell Lee became the first person to be executed in Arkansas since 2005, after the US Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the scheduling of the executions and the Arkansas Supreme Court overturned a ruling blocking the use of a different drug. Both Jack Jones and Marcel Williams had filed their own legal challenges before their executions on Monday night. Attorneys for Jones had argued he could suffer from a ""torturous death"" because he may be resistant to midazolam. Lawyers for Williams had said it might be difficult to find a vein on their client for the lethal injection because of his 400lb (180kg) weight. Williams was sentenced to death in 1997 for kidnapping, raping and murdering Stacy Errickson. He also abducted and raped two other women. His execution was put on hold minutes before he was scheduled to die, as his lawyers raised concerns that Jones' execution had been ""inhumane"". But a district judge allowed the execution to go ahead after a brief hearing. Williams' lawyers said that Jones was still moving more than five minutes after he received the injection that was supposed to make him unconscious. But other witnesses quoted by local media disputed their version of events, arguing that Jones had showed no signs of distress.  Jones was convicted in 1996 of raping and strangling Mary Phillips and attempting to murder her 11-year-old daughter. In his final utterance, he apologised to the girl he nearly killed, who is now an adult. ""I hope over time you could learn who I really am and I am not a monster,"" witnesses quoted him as saying. But the victim's widower told the BBC justice had been served. ""It will never bring back Mary,"" James Phillips said, ""and we knew that our main concern was we promised her we'd be on the front row of justice when justice was served.  ""And it took too long, but we finally got it.  ""I really do feel for his [Jack Jones'] family, too, and I know it has to be hard on his side - both sides of the family."" The two men were among eight that the state wanted to execute over the course of 11 days in April before its supplies of midazolam expired. Four of the scheduled executions have been delayed by the courts. Another is scheduled for Thursday 27 April.  Like many US states, Arkansas has struggled to find the drugs it needs to carry out executions. One of the legal challenges to the series of executions was lodged by McKesson Corporation, which makes the drug vecuronium bromide - part of the three-drug lethal injection cocktail. The company claimed that the state had intentionally misled them, saying the drug would be used in health clinics for medical purposes. When McKesson found out it would be used in executions, it said it issued a refund and demanded the chemical be returned - which it never was. The state made no comment on the claims. ""We believe we have done all we can do at this time to recover our product,"" the company said in a statement after the state Supreme Court overturned a brief injunction. Human rights groups have been heavily critical of the accelerated pace of executions. Amnesty International said Arkansas' decision was a ""shameful backslide against prevailing trends away from the death penalty"". Ahead of Monday's executions, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union had called for them, and the execution scheduled for Thursday, to be cancelled.  ""Carrying out these three executions on this schedule will violate the individualized consideration that the constitution and justice require and further overstep the bounds of basic human dignity,"" Cassandra Stubbs wrote. But earlier in April, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said he was fulfilling his responsibilities. ""I have a responsibility to the voters, I have a responsibility to my oath of office, but I also have responsibility to a higher power, God and eternity, and I understand that,"" he said. ""I feel comfortable in my understanding of my responsibilities both in terms of faith and scripture and in terms of as governor.""",Tuesday 25 April 2017,25-Apr-17,Arkansas set for rare US double execution,Lawyers for Jack Jones and Marcel Williams are seeking stays on grounds of poor health.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39695668
"Much-loved 'George Washington oak tree' cut down A 600-year-old oak tree where President George Washington once picnicked has been cut down after starting to show signs of its age.

"Plastic-eating caterpillar could munch waste, scientists say A caterpillar that munches on plastic bags could hold the key to tackling plastic pollution, scientists say.  Researchers at Cambridge University have discovered that the larvae of the moth, which eats wax in bee hives, can also degrade plastic. Experiments show the insect can break down the chemical bonds of plastic in a similar way to digesting beeswax.   Each year, about 80 million tonnes of the plastic polyethylene are produced around the world. The plastic is used to make shopping bags and food packaging, among other things, but it can take hundreds of years to decompose completely.   However, caterpillars of the moth (Galleria mellonella) can make holes in a plastic bag in under an hour.   Dr Paolo Bombelli is a biochemist at the University of Cambridge and one of the researchers on the study.    ""The caterpillar will be the starting point,"" he told BBC News.   ""We need to understand the details under which this process operates.   ""We hope to provide the technical solution for minimising the problem of plastic waste.""    Dr Bombelli and colleague Federica Bertocchini of the Spanish National Research Council have patented the discovery.   They want to speed up the process of discovering the chemical secrets behind the natural degradation of plastic.   They think microbes in the caterpillar - as well as the insect itself - might play a role in breaking down plastic.   If the chemical process can be identified, it could lead to a solution to managing plastic waste in the environment.  ""We are planning to implement this finding into a viable way to get rid of plastic waste, working towards a solution to save our oceans, rivers, and all the environment from the unavoidable consequences of plastic accumulation,"" said Dr Bertocchini.   ""However, we should not feel justified to dump polyethylene deliberately in our environment just because we now know how to bio-degrade it.""  The research is published in the journal, Current Biology.

"Sir Elton suffered 'potentially deadly' infection on tour Sir Elton John suffered a ""potentially deadly"" bacterial infection during a tour, forcing him to spend two nights in intensive care and cancel concerts in the US, his management says. The singer became violently ill at the end of a tour of South America last week, requiring him to return to the UK for urgent treatment. Nine concerts that were due to be staged in Las Vegas and California over the next two weeks have been cancelled. Sir Elton is now resting at home.  A statement by his management said infections of the kind suffered by the star were ""rare and potentially deadly"". It gave no other details. ""Thankfully, Elton's medical team identified this quickly and treated it successfully. He is expected to make a full and complete recovery,"" it added.  Sir Elton is due to resume his schedule of live performances in the UK on 3 June.  ""I am so fortunate to have the most incredible and loyal fans and apologise for disappointing them. I am extremely grateful to the medical team for their excellence in looking after me so well,"" the star said.  His Million Dollar Piano tour is due to end its run in May 2018.  It is not the first time Sir Elton has battled a serious bout of ill-health. While performing his show The Million Dollar Piano at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada in May 2012, Sir Elton became ill with a serious respiratory infection. Following his doctor's recommendation, he cancelled the show's last four concerts. In July 2013, he had to cancel a concert in London's Hyde Park when he was diagnosed with appendicitis, which required urgent surgery. ""I knew I was sick but I didn't know I had such a dangerous thing inside of me until I had a scan, which was after nine shows, 24 flights and a summer ball. I could have easily died,"" he later said in an interview with The Telegraph. Various organisations have tweeted get well messages to Sir Elton, including American Idol, This Morning and BPI Music, which wrote: ""Dear Sir @eltonofficial we're sorry to hear you've been unwell but so happy you are on the mend, and we wish you a full & speedy recovery."" The career of Sir Elton spans five decades and has been littered with accolades, hit singles and world records.

"US imposes 'sweeping' Syria sanctions over 'chemical' attack The US has imposed ""sweeping"" sanctions on officials in a Syrian government agency in response to a suspected chemical attack earlier this month. The treasury department ordered a freeze on all assets in the US of 271 employees of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC). The US believes it made the nerve agent that killed more than 80 people in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. Syria says the incident was a fabrication. President Bashar al-Assad has accused the West of making up events in Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April so the US had an excuse to carry out missile strikes on the government's Shayrat airbase, which took place a few days after the alleged attack. Syria 'chemical attack': What we know In a statement on Monday, the treasury department said the 271 employees had been responsible for developing and producing non-conventional weapons and the means to deliver them"". The sanctions mean that American citizens will be forbidden from having any dealings with them. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that ""these sweeping sanctions target the scientific support centre for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's horrific chemical weapons attack on innocent civilian men, women, and children.   ""The United States is sending a strong message with this action that we will hold the entire Assad regime accountable for these blatant human rights violations in order to deter the spread of these types of barbaric chemical weapons."" Witnesses have said they saw warplanes attack Khan Sheikhoun - but Russia, a key ally of President Assad, says a rebel depot of chemical munitions was hit. Footage showed victims - many of them children - convulsing and foaming at the mouth. Sufferers were taken to hospitals across the border in Turkey. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said that allegations of a chemical attack were ""credible"" based on a preliminary examination of the evidence. More than 300,000 people have lost their lives and millions of people have been displaced since a peaceful uprising against President Assad six years ago turned into a full-scale civil war.

"Trump backs down on border wall funding Donald Trump has indicated he will scrap plans to find cash for his border wall in this week's spending bill. The president's close adviser, Kellyanne Conway, said funding for the wall would be left out of a budget measure that must pass by Friday. Building the wall, paid for by Mexico, was a key campaign promise. Democrats had threatened to block the bill if money was earmarked for the wall, so its omission may now avert a government shutdown. But the president insisted on Twitter that he still supported the wall and that it would be built. He reportedly told a private meeting with members of the conservative media on Monday night that he might be open to funding the wall later in the year. And Ms Conway confirmed to Fox News that the wall does not need to be funded this week, but remains a ""very important priority"". It was the centrepiece of the Trump election campaign. There was going to be a border wall, and at every rally he would shout out: ""And who's going to pay for it?"" And the crowd would roar back: ""Mexico!"" Except the Mexican government made clear there was no way it was going to fund it.  So when President Trump moved into the White House, he said that - initially - it might require US taxpayers to fund its construction, but the money would be clawed back from Mexico at a later stage.  Now with the president approaching his 100th day in office, he's come across another rock solid wall - the one presented by Democratic senators in opposition to his proposals.  They are able to block the spending proposals, and so the White House budget director will have to rewrite his plans - minus the funding for the border wall.  The president tweeted this morning: ""Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.""  At some point in the future it may well get built, but this has been a stark lesson in the difference between campaigning and governing. Mr Trump had proposed $1.5bn (£1.2bn) for his wall as part of the spending bill, which funds federal agencies to the end of the current fiscal year. Analysts say the president is under pressure to deliver on his election pledges, few of which have been fulfilled during his first 100 days in office. Has Trump kept his promises? 100 voters reflect on Trump's 100 days How much has Trump achieved so far? Presidential Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on Tuesday said he was ""working at breakneck speed within the confines of the law"" to implement his promises. The president's funding plans for the wall have united Democrats in blanket opposition.

"Obama criticised for '$400,000 Wall Street speech' Former US President Barack Obama is being criticised for reportedly agreeing a $400,000 (£310,000) fee for a speech to a Wall Street bank. The 44th president has accepted an offer to speak at a healthcare conference hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald in September, US media report.  The deal comes less than 100 days after Mr Obama left office. In 2009, he told CBS: ""I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street."" Mr Obama has reportedly agreed to be a keynote speaker at an event hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald LP, an investment bank that lost more than two-thirds of its staff in the attack on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. The fee is nearly twice the $225,000 that Hillary Clinton received for three speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2015. She was heavily criticised during last year's presidential campaign for her Wall Street speeches, with activists on both sides of the political spectrum demanding she release the transcripts. During Mr Obama's two terms as US president he at times seemed to have strained relations with the financial sector. He deplored high bonuses paid to bank executives, and said Wall Street shared blame for the 2008 financial crisis. Some liberals have criticised Mr Obama's speech decision, with one writer saying it ""will undermine everything he believes in"". The New York Post, meanwhile, said his speech made him ""Wall Street's newest fat cat"". Mr Obama appears to be enjoying life after the White House since he left office in January. On Monday he made his first public remarks about community organising to students at the University of Chicago, where his presidential library is set to be built. He was pictured kite-surfing in February with Richard Branson off the Virgin tycoon's private Caribbean island. And just this month, he and former First Lady Michelle Obama were pictured aboard music mogul David Geffen's luxury yacht off French Polynesia. They were reportedly on holiday with Bruce Springsteen, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey. Mr Obama also took in a Broadway play in New York City before dining with U2's Bono.

"Thai man kills baby on Facebook Live then takes own life A Thai man filmed himself killing his baby daughter on Facebook Live, before taking his own life, Thai police say. The 21-year-old hanged his daughter, and then himself, at a deserted hotel in Phuket on Monday, reportedly after an argument with his wife. Facebook sent condolences to the family for the ""appalling"" incident and said that the content had now been removed. The company pledged a review of its processes after footage of a US killing stayed online for hours this month. The footage of the Thai killing had also been available on video sharing website YouTube, but the company took it down after the BBC alerted it to its presence. Relatives of the Thai man, Wuttisan Wongtalay, saw the distressing footage and alerted the police - but the authorities arrived too late to save him and his daughter. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""This is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim. There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed."" Reuters said two videos were posted, at 16:50 (09:50 GMT) and 16:57 on Monday, and were taken down at about 17:00 on Tuesday, roughly 24 hours later. Facebook has yet to confirm the times to the BBC. Thailand's ministry of digital economy said it had contacted Facebook on Tuesday afternoon about removing the videos. Ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters: ""We will not be able to press charges against Facebook, because Facebook is the service provider and they acted according to their protocol when we sent our request. They co-operated very well."" YouTube said it had taken down the video within 15 minutes of being told of its presence by the BBC. Its statement read: ""YouTube has clear policies that outline what's acceptable to post and we quickly remove videos that break our rules when they're flagged."" Shortly before the BBC alerted YouTube, the video was showing 2,351 views. Thai social media users reacted with anger to the footage, while offering condolences to the family of the girl, BBC Thai editor Nopporn Wong-Anan says. Devastated relatives of the child, including the mother, picked up the body of the girl and her father from hospital on Tuesday. Following the US killing, Facebook said it was ""constantly exploring ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment"".  ""We prioritise reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster,"" blogged one of its executives last week. Separately on Tuesday, a court in Sweden jailed three men over the gang-rape of a woman in the city of Uppsala, 80km (50 miles) north of Stockholm, earlier this year and its live-streaming on Facebook. One man was jailed for two years and four months, and another for one year, both for rape. The third was jailed for six months for posting the rape on Facebook and failing to report it.  This latest atrocity comes less than a fortnight after a US man bragged on Facebook Live about his murder of a 74-year-old man in Cleveland, having also posted a video of the killing to the social network. The platform's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently acknowledged he had ""a lot of work"" to do after it emerged the murder clip had remained online for more than two hours despite Facebook having received complaints in the meantime. Prior to that, Facebook Live broadcast the death of a Chicago man who was shot in the neck and head last June, and then in July a woman streamed the death of her boyfriend after he was shot by police in Minneapolis. There have also been reports of sexual assaults, animal abuse and teenage suicide having been shown. For its part, Facebook is trying to find ways for its review team - which employs thousands of people - to react to such content more quickly. In addition, the firm has developed software to prevent such footage being reshared in full on its service at a later point.  And it is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to automatically flag videos and photos that need to be reviewed rather than waiting for other users to report them. What it hasn't discussed is the idea of scrapping Facebook Live altogether.  With Twitter and YouTube, among others, offering rival live-streaming products, doing so could put it at a disadvantage. But as a result, there will inevitably be further outrages and criticism because Facebook Live's popularity makes it all but impossible for the firm to keep a human eye over each broadcast.",Wednesday 26 April 2017,26-Apr-17,Man kills baby daughter on Facebook Live,Facebook's processes were already under scrutiny after video of a US killing stayed online for hours.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39706205
"Fitbit contradicts husband's story of wife's murder - police A cheating US husband has been charged with killing his wife after police said data from her wearable fitness tracker contradicted his version of events. Richard Dabate, 40, claimed to have seen Connie Dabate shot to death more than an hour before her Fitbit device recorded her last movements. He told detectives that she was killed by a home intruder in the US state of Connecticut on 23 December 2015. But police say her electronic device tells a different story.  Mr Dabate was charged this month with murder, tampering with physical evidence and making false statements about his 39-year-old wife's death. Police say he initially told them he had just returned home at around 09:00 after dropping off his two sons when he was attacked by a home intruder. He claimed the perpetrator was a ""tall, obese man"" with a deep voice like actor Vin Diesel's and wearing ""camouflage and a mask"", according to an arrest warrant. The accused said a .357 revolver registered in his name was used by the purported attacker to shoot Mrs Dabate. The victim, a pharmaceutical representative, was shot twice, once in the back of her head, with the pistol that her husband had purchased two months earlier, say prosecutors. Mr Dabate, a computer technician, claimed the home intruder then tied him up after a struggle. Police found Mr Dabate with an arm and leg bound by zip ties to a chair in the kitchen at the crime scene.  He had what police described as superficial knife wounds. Investigators say physical evidence showed no sign of the struggle described by Mr Dabate. Data found on a Fitbit that Mrs Dabate had worn for an exercise class that morning shows she did not take her last movements until 10:05, more than an hour after her husband claimed to watch her die. Also, police sniffer dogs picked up no scent of other people in the house in the hours before Mrs Dabate's death. Her husband was in a relationship with another woman, who was expecting his baby - which detectives suspect as a motive for the attack. According to investigators, Mr Dabate had texted his wife a year before her death saying: ""I want a divorce.""  Bank statements obtained by the Hartford Courant newspaper showed credit card charges from hotels and bouquets of flowers for his girlfriend, as well as strip clubs. The accused is currently not in custody after posting bail of $1m.  His next trial date is scheduled for 28 April. Mr Dabate's lawyer says his client is innocent.

"Trump immigration court defeat is 'bananas', says White House The White House has labelled ""bananas"" a ruling that blocks President Donald Trump's order barring funding for cities that shelter illegal immigrants. A San Francisco judge has placed January's executive order in limbo, but the White House is vowing to appeal. San Francisco and Santa Clara County sued in February. The Trump administration has warned so-called sanctuary cities they could lose federal funds if they do not co-operate with federal immigration officials. On Tuesday, Judge William Orrick issued a temporary injunction against the presidential order as the case continues in the courts. ""It's the 9th Circuit going bananas,"" White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, in reference to the San Francisco-based appeals court, which conservatives often accuse of liberalism. Mr Trump's measure cast doubt on the transfer of some $1.2bn (£940m) for San Francisco and $1.7bn to Santa Clara County, home to many Silicon Valley communities. It is another legal defeat for President Trump in his efforts to curb immigration - his plan to curtail travel from seven Muslim-majority nations was twice blocked in federal courts. Lawyers for the federal government had argued in the sanctuary cities case that only funding related to law enforcement would be withheld. But Judge Orrick said any doubt about the scope of the ""vague"" order was erased by public comments made by President Trump, such as those calling the measure a ""weapon"" to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his immigration policies. He accused the Trump administration of a ""schizophrenic approach"" to the order. The 49-page court ruling added that the plaintiffs challenging President Trump's order are likely to succeed in proving the order unconstitutional. ""Federal funding... cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves,"" the judge wrote. However, Judge Orrick's ruling allowed the justice department to follow through with threats made to nine cities last week to cut specific programme grants if they do not adequately co-operate with federal immigration officers. In a press release last week, the department accused sanctuary cities of ""crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime"". There are several sanctuary cities across the US, including Mr Trump's home of New York.  New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio praised Tuesday's ruling, saying the president went beyond his authority to cut funding to cities that ""don't share his illogical and unconstitutional desire to scapegoat immigrants"".

"Turkey air strikes on Kurds in Syria and Iraq spark US concern The US has expressed ""deep concern"" at Turkish air strikes that killed about two dozen Kurdish fighters in Syria and Iraq. The US-backed Popular Protection Units (YPG), fighting against IS, said their positions were hit multiple times. Turkey regards the YPG as linked to outlawed Kurdish separatists. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga, friendly to Turkey, also reportedly suffered fatalities. The Iraqi government condemned the strikes carried out on its territory. US state department spokesman Mark Toner said: ""We are very concerned, deeply concerned that Turkey conducted air strikes earlier today in northern Syria as well as northern Iraq without proper co-ordination either with the United States or the broader global coalition to defeat IS."" He added: ""We have expressed those concerns to the government of Turkey directly."" Iraqi government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi said: ""The Iraqi government condemns and rejects the strikes carried out by Turkish aircraft on Iraqi territory."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended the air strikes, telling Reuters: ""We are obliged to take measures. We must take steps. ""We shared this with the US and Russia and we are sharing it with Iraq as well. It is an operation that (Iraqi Kurdistan President Massoud) Barzani has been informed about."" The number killed has not been confirmed but reports suggest about 18 YPG and five Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga members died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring organisation, said a dawn strike on Tuesday targeted Kurdish positions in Hassakeh province in north-east Syria, hitting a media centre and radio station. A separate series of strikes hit a base near Sinjar in northern Iraq, close to the Syrian border. Mr Erdogan said he regretted the death of the Peshmerga, saying it was ""absolutely not an operation against [them]"". The Peshmerga are the military forces of the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan. In a statement, the Peshmerga said that while the attack was ""unacceptable"", it blamed forces from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the area and called on them to withdraw. The PKK is a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group that has been fighting an armed struggle against the Turkish government since the 1980s. The strikes reflect how complicated the situation is in the battle against so-called Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. The US is relying heavily on Kurdish forces on the ground but its ally, Turkey, views the YPG as an extension of the PKK. A ceasefire between Turkey and the PKK ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides. A commander for the Kurdish forces in Syria called on its international allies to defend their forces from further attacks. ""We are asking the international coalition to intervene to stop these Turkish violations,"" the unnamed commander told the AFP news agency. ""It's unthinkable that we are fighting on a front as important as Raqqa while Turkish planes bomb us in the back,"" he said, referring to the IS stronghold in northern Syria.

"White House blocks Flynn document request The White House has told a US congressional committee it will not comply with a request to release files related to a controversial former aide. The House Oversight Committee is looking into payments to fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Lawmakers suspect he failed to disclose money he received in December 2015 to address a Moscow gala, where he sat next to President Vladimir Putin. Mr Flynn quit in February after misleading the White House. The retired US Army lieutenant general had failed to divulge his conversations with the Russian ambassador, to Vice-President Mike Pence. Mr Flynn's links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and two congressional committees, as part of wider investigations into claims that Moscow sought to help Donald Trump win the US presidential election. In addition to those inquiries, the House Oversight Committee is looking into whether Mr Flynn fully disclosed payments from Russian and Turkish or other foreign sources. The oversight panel wanted to see his application for security clearance before he joined the White House administration in January. But the White House referred the request to the defence department. White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said in a letter on 19 April that he would be ""unable to accommodate"" the request because it relates to Mr Flynn's actions before joining the White House. The legal noose appears to be tightening around Michael Flynn's neck.  While he was forced to resign as Donald Trump's national security adviser because of political concerns - what the White House said was a lack of honesty with Mr Pence and other administration officials - he's now being accused of disclosure violations that could carry criminal charges. While this is obviously concerning to Mr Flynn, it's also a significant embarrassment for the White House, as these revelations represent a massive breakdown in the vetting process for its high-ranking officials. The position of national security adviser is extremely sensitive - effectively the president's eyes and ears within the defence and intelligence communities - and the person who fills the role should be free from any possible foreign entanglements or possible ethical conflicts.  The contours of Mr Flynn's Russian connections were firmly in view as he emerged as a contender for a White House job and yet, it appears, the president and his team either pressed on without delving deeper into the matter or - perhaps more concerning - allowed the former general to come on board in spite of everything they may have known. Such actions border on gross negligence. The verdict on Trump so far Follow @awzurcher on Twitter The Republican chairman of the oversight committee, Jason Chaffetz, said Mr Flynn did not report payments for the 2015 Russia trip on his top-level security clearance form.  ""I see no data to support the notion that General Flynn complied with the law,"" said Mr Chaffetz. Mr Flynn received more than $33,000 (£25,700) from Russian broadcaster RT for giving a speech at its Moscow gala. He was seated at a table next to the Russian president. Mr Flynn did not initially disclose payments received by foreign governments when filing financial disclosure forms related to his White House security clearance. He filed an amended form in March, revealing three payments from the Russian government. He also received more than $500,000 from Turkey for lobbying he undertook on their behalf in Washington after leaving the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014, and before joining the Trump administration. Mr Flynn wants immunity to testify before Congress on alleged Russian election meddling, his lawyer has said. ""As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else,"" Mr Chaffetz said.  ""And it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate.

"Ivanka Trump forced to defend father at G20 women's summit Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka was met with groans as she defended her father's attitude towards women at the G20 women's summit in Berlin. The First Daughter was taking part in a panel discussion about female entrepreneurs alongside German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and IMF chief Christine Lagarde. But the audience bristled at her praise for the US president. The event is part of the G20 women's summit. Ivanka Trump: America's first daughter? An audible groan went up as she told the room her father was a ""tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive"". Mr Trump has been criticised over his attitude to women, especially after a tape of him making obscene remarks was released during the presidential campaign. But Ms Trump said that although she had ""heard the criticism from the media and that has been perpetuated"", she did not recognise her father in the description and nor would the ""thousands"" of women he had employed over the years. ""He encouraged me and enabled me to thrive. I grew up in a house where there were no barriers to what I could accomplish,"" she added. As she posed for photographs with the world's most powerful women, the first daughter rubbed shoulders with a chancellor, a queen and a leading banker. But it was the absent figure of a president that overshadowed Ivanka Trump's first official overseas engagement.  Ignoring the boos, hisses and disapproval of a room full of female delegates, Donald Trump's special adviser persisted in her defence of a father who, she said, had enabled and encouraged her.  Ostensibly today's visit - at the direct invitation of Angela Merkel - was about empowering women. But it's been widely interpreted here as an attempt to forge another line of communication to the US president, and may mark a profound shift in the way in which Berlin - and Europe - does business with Washington.  Thus far the charm offensive seems to be working. Despite their significantly different politics, Mr Trump has said that he shares an unbelievable chemistry with the German chancellor.  The relationship Mrs Merkel forges with his daughter will be closely scrutinised on both sides of the Atlantic. Because there is an acknowledgement in Berlin that, in the age of Trump, family comes first.  Mr Trump tends to blame the media for negative portrayals of his character or presidency. It remains unclear what exactly Ms Trump's role is within her father's White House. In March, it was announced that Ms Trump - who joined her father's business a year after graduating from university - would be an unpaid assistant to the president. She and her husband Jared Kushner are seen as increasingly influential, however, and German newspaper Berliner Zeitung said officials hoped ""the president's daughter will convey a positive image of Germany to her father as a result of her short visit"". Mrs Merkel invited Ms Trump during her trip to Washington last month. Ms Trump has spoken repeatedly about the need to empower women professionally, including in an opinion piece for the Financial Times ahead of her visit to Berlin. Ms Trump was on the stage thanks to her background as a businesswoman and her position as the US president's daughter. But who were the other women? Angela Merkel: The German chancellor is arguably Europe's most powerful leader and has been active in politics since the late 1980s, when she completed her doctorate in quantum chemistry. She has been in power since 2005 and is seeking re-election later this year.  Christine Lagarde: The head of the IMF is the first woman in the role and previously served as France's finance minister for four years. Before that she spent more than two decades working in law. She also has a number of masters degrees. Queen Maxima of the Netherlands: The Argentinean-born royal worked for some of the world's top banks before meeting and marrying King Willem-Alexander. She is also a UN Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.

"Has the US started a lumber trade war with Canada? The United States is slapping hefty new tariffs on the import of Canadian softwood lumber.  The US Commerce Department says that Canada is improperly subsidising its exports of the forestry product.   This is just the latest volley in the long-running lumber trade dispute between the two countries.  It also comes during a sensitive time in US-Canada trade relations, with North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) talks on the horizon.  US President Donald Trump has been sending Canada mixed messages on trade, initially offering assurances that Nafta will only need ""tweaks"" but recently singling out Canada's softwood lumber and dairy industries for criticism.  As US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement: ""It has been a bad week for US-Canada trade relations.""  Canada is ""generally a good neighbour but that doesn't mean they don't have to play by the rules,"" he later said.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his job is to stick up for Canada's interests.  Here are five things to know about the Canada-US softwood lumber spat.   The US has claimed for decades that Canada is unfairly subsidising its lumber industry by charging minimal fees to log public lands. On Monday, the US Commerce Department imposed an overall 20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber.  In this ""preliminary determination"", five exporters each face specific countervailing duties, which are meant to level the playing field between domestic producers  and government-subsidised foreign producers of a product, ranging from 3.2% to 24.12%. The US Commerce Department valued softwood lumber imports from Canada at US$5.6bn (C$7.6bn/£4.3bn) in 2016.  The duties will amount to about US$1bn, according to Secretary Ross.  This comes after no breakthrough was reached in recent talks in the decades-long dispute.  President Trump is finding it difficult to turn campaign rhetoric into government action in in many arenas, but particularly so in overseas trade.  He won the presidency, in part, with a strong and simple message of ""winning"" trade deals and being ""tough"" with the US's biggest trading partners. In the real world, that turns out to be a risky approach.  The president has notably declined to follow up on any of his harsh rhetoric about China, for example.  Nevertheless he needs some way of showing how he can be tough. A dust up with Canada about lumber is probably a safe fight to pick. The lumber business is worth a fraction of the overall trade with Canada and set against so much shared history and thousands of miles of border, it's hardly likely to undermine US-Canadian relations on its own.  However it doesn't auger well for a smooth renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement if that's really what President Trump wants. Mr Trudeau spoke on Tuesday evening with Mr Trump and said afterwards that Canada would ""vigorously defend"" its softwood lumber industry.  Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a joint statement that Canada ""disagrees strongly"" with what they called ""an unfair and punitive duty"".  Mr Trudeau said on Tuesday that ""you cannot thicken this border without hurting people on both sides of it"".  Susan Yurkovich, president of the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council, said in a statement that ""these duties are unwarranted, and this determination is completely without merit"".  The province is the the largest Canadian exporter of softwood lumber to the US.  But the decision was cheered by the US Lumber Coalition, an alliance of American lumber producers formed in 1985 to fight what it calls the ""devastating effect of Canada's lumber subsidies"" on their industry.  Meanwhile, the US National Association of Home Builders denounced the decision as ""short-sighted"" and warned it would increase the cost of housing in the US. Secretary Ross said it will only have a small impact.  Softwood lumber products, like pine, fir and spruce, are mainly used in the construction of single family houses.  Minister Jim Carr quipped on Tuesday that lumber disputes have been ""the most significant trade irritant between the US and Canada since Confederation"" 150 years ago.  This specific dispute, however, dates back over 30 years to the early 1980s, when a group of US lumber producers first called for countervailing duties on Canadian softwood.  As a result of a series of disputes in the intervening years, the first US-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement - a five year deal - was signed in 1996.  Soon after that deal expired, the US lumber industry petitioned Washington to impose duties on softwood lumber imports. In 2002, the US imposed those tariffs. In 2006, Canada and the US reached a second Softwood Lumber Agreement for a seven-year term, under which the US scrapped the duties and Canada imposed taxes and quantitative restriction on lumber exports  That was extended until 2015, and the US government and industry agreed to not undertake any new countervailing or antidumping duty investigations for a year - that deal expired last October.   In November, the US lumber industry filed antidumping and countervailing duty cases under American trade laws, launching the fifth round in the lumber row.  Both countries will feel a shock, with the US comprising almost 70% of Canada's softwood market.  There are about 600 mills across Canada producing softwood lumber and over 170 communities get 20% or more of direct income from that industry.  Minister Carr noted there were lost job and closed mills the last time the US imposed tariffs, and Ottawa is preparing for ""tough times"".  In the US, the renovation and construction industries are expected to feel the impact.  One-third of lumber used in the US last year was imported and the bulk - over 95% according to the US National Association of Home Builders - was Canadian.  The group estimates the recent 22% jump in the cost of softwood lumber in the US, caused by recent uncertainty around the product, has added almost US$3,600 to the price of a new home. Canada says it is interested in a ""good faith resolution"" in this dispute but will defend its interests including through litigation, though that was not immediately on the table.  Minister Carr noted Canada has prevailed in previous rounds of litigation ""and we will do so again"" but also said he believes that the trade relationship is so consequential for both countries that ""we will work through this"".  Canada is also seeking to open new markets abroad, including in China.  In the US, a preliminary antidumping ruling is scheduled for 23 June, looking at whether Canadian lumber has been dumped in the US market. Dumping occurs when a company exports its product at a lower price than it charges domestically.  The US Department of Commerce is also expected to announce its final duty rates by late 2017.

"St Petersburg bombing: Group says al-Qaeda chief ordered attack A little-known group claiming links to al-Qaeda has said it carried out the deadly metro bombing in St Petersburg earlier this month. The Imam Shamil Battalion said the attack in the Russian city was carried out on the orders of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Its statement has been circulated by high-profile al-Qaeda supporters on the Telegram messaging app. The attack in St Petersburg killed 16 people, including the suicide bomber. Russian officials later said Akbarzhon Jalilov, a Russian citizen born in Kyrgyzstan, detonated a bomb between two metro stations in the city. The Imam Shamil Battalion statement said the bombing was revenge for Russian military actions in Muslim countries such as Syria and Libya as well as the Muslim region of Chechnya in Russia's North Caucasus. More attacks were being planned, the statement said. The authenticity of the claim has not been independently verified. It emerged in news outlets used by jihadists in Africa, including the Mauritania-based website Agence Nouakchott Info, but has not appeared on official al-Qaeda channels.

"Has the US started a lumber trade war with Canada? The United States is slapping hefty new tariffs on the import of Canadian softwood lumber.  The US Commerce Department says that Canada is improperly subsidising its exports of the forestry product.   This is just the latest volley in the long-running lumber trade dispute between the two countries.  It also comes during a sensitive time in US-Canada trade relations, with North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) talks on the horizon.  US President Donald Trump has been sending Canada mixed messages on trade, initially offering assurances that Nafta will only need ""tweaks"" but recently singling out Canada's softwood lumber and dairy industries for criticism.  As US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement: ""It has been a bad week for US-Canada trade relations.""  Canada is ""generally a good neighbour but that doesn't mean they don't have to play by the rules,"" he later said.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his job is to stick up for Canada's interests.  Here are five things to know about the Canada-US softwood lumber spat.   The US has claimed for decades that Canada is unfairly subsidising its lumber industry by charging minimal fees to log public lands. On Monday, the US Commerce Department imposed an overall 20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber.  In this ""preliminary determination"", five exporters each face specific countervailing duties, which are meant to level the playing field between domestic producers  and government-subsidised foreign producers of a product, ranging from 3.2% to 24.12%. The US Commerce Department valued softwood lumber imports from Canada at US$5.6bn (C$7.6bn/£4.3bn) in 2016.  The duties will amount to about US$1bn, according to Secretary Ross.  This comes after no breakthrough was reached in recent talks in the decades-long dispute.  President Trump is finding it difficult to turn campaign rhetoric into government action in in many arenas, but particularly so in overseas trade.  He won the presidency, in part, with a strong and simple message of ""winning"" trade deals and being ""tough"" with the US's biggest trading partners. In the real world, that turns out to be a risky approach.  The president has notably declined to follow up on any of his harsh rhetoric about China, for example.  Nevertheless he needs some way of showing how he can be tough. A dust up with Canada about lumber is probably a safe fight to pick. The lumber business is worth a fraction of the overall trade with Canada and set against so much shared history and thousands of miles of border, it's hardly likely to undermine US-Canadian relations on its own.  However it doesn't auger well for a smooth renegotiation of the North America Free Trade Agreement if that's really what President Trump wants. Mr Trudeau spoke on Tuesday evening with Mr Trump and said afterwards that Canada would ""vigorously defend"" its softwood lumber industry.  Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a joint statement that Canada ""disagrees strongly"" with what they called ""an unfair and punitive duty"".  Mr Trudeau said on Tuesday that ""you cannot thicken this border without hurting people on both sides of it"".  Susan Yurkovich, president of the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council, said in a statement that ""these duties are unwarranted, and this determination is completely without merit"".  The province is the the largest Canadian exporter of softwood lumber to the US.  But the decision was cheered by the US Lumber Coalition, an alliance of American lumber producers formed in 1985 to fight what it calls the ""devastating effect of Canada's lumber subsidies"" on their industry.  Meanwhile, the US National Association of Home Builders denounced the decision as ""short-sighted"" and warned it would increase the cost of housing in the US. Secretary Ross said it will only have a small impact.  Softwood lumber products, like pine, fir and spruce, are mainly used in the construction of single family houses.  Minister Jim Carr quipped on Tuesday that lumber disputes have been ""the most significant trade irritant between the US and Canada since Confederation"" 150 years ago.  This specific dispute, however, dates back over 30 years to the early 1980s, when a group of US lumber producers first called for countervailing duties on Canadian softwood.  As a result of a series of disputes in the intervening years, the first US-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement - a five year deal - was signed in 1996.  Soon after that deal expired, the US lumber industry petitioned Washington to impose duties on softwood lumber imports. In 2002, the US imposed those tariffs. In 2006, Canada and the US reached a second Softwood Lumber Agreement for a seven-year term, under which the US scrapped the duties and Canada imposed taxes and quantitative restriction on lumber exports  That was extended until 2015, and the US government and industry agreed to not undertake any new countervailing or antidumping duty investigations for a year - that deal expired last October.   In November, the US lumber industry filed antidumping and countervailing duty cases under American trade laws, launching the fifth round in the lumber row.  Both countries will feel a shock, with the US comprising almost 70% of Canada's softwood market.  There are about 600 mills across Canada producing softwood lumber and over 170 communities get 20% or more of direct income from that industry.  Minister Carr noted there were lost job and closed mills the last time the US imposed tariffs, and Ottawa is preparing for ""tough times"".  In the US, the renovation and construction industries are expected to feel the impact.  One-third of lumber used in the US last year was imported and the bulk - over 95% according to the US National Association of Home Builders - was Canadian.  The group estimates the recent 22% jump in the cost of softwood lumber in the US, caused by recent uncertainty around the product, has added almost US$3,600 to the price of a new home. Canada says it is interested in a ""good faith resolution"" in this dispute but will defend its interests including through litigation, though that was not immediately on the table.  Minister Carr noted Canada has prevailed in previous rounds of litigation ""and we will do so again"" but also said he believes that the trade relationship is so consequential for both countries that ""we will work through this"".  Canada is also seeking to open new markets abroad, including in China.  In the US, a preliminary antidumping ruling is scheduled for 23 June, looking at whether Canadian lumber has been dumped in the US market. Dumping occurs when a company exports its product at a lower price than it charges domestically.  The US Department of Commerce is also expected to announce its final duty rates by late 2017.

"St Petersburg bombing: Group says al-Qaeda chief ordered attack A little-known group claiming links to al-Qaeda has said it carried out the deadly metro bombing in St Petersburg earlier this month. The Imam Shamil Battalion said the attack in the Russian city was carried out on the orders of al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Its statement has been circulated by high-profile al-Qaeda supporters on the Telegram messaging app. The attack in St Petersburg killed 16 people, including the suicide bomber. Russian officials later said Akbarzhon Jalilov, a Russian citizen born in Kyrgyzstan, detonated a bomb between two metro stations in the city. The Imam Shamil Battalion statement said the bombing was revenge for Russian military actions in Muslim countries such as Syria and Libya as well as the Muslim region of Chechnya in Russia's North Caucasus. More attacks were being planned, the statement said. The authenticity of the claim has not been independently verified. It emerged in news outlets used by jihadists in Africa, including the Mauritania-based website Agence Nouakchott Info, but has not appeared on official al-Qaeda channels. The Russian authorities have so far made no comment. Analysts say the name of the group claiming the bombing may be a reference to Imam Shamil - a 19th Century leader of anti-Russian resistance in the Caucasus.

"Tom Hardy apprehends 'fleeing motorbike thief' in London Actor Tom Hardy helped to apprehend a man who had allegedly stolen a motorbike in London, police have said. The Hollywood star stepped in after two teenagers on the bike crashed into a car in Richmond, south-west London, on Sunday afternoon. They ran off before one was grabbed by the Mad Max and Taboo star and the other was arrested by a police officer. Two 16-year-olds have been arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, police said. Witness Arun Pullen told The Sun newspaper: ""Tom must have been walking down the road.   ""He went off like a shot in pursuit and looked furious. ""I asked Tom what happened and he told me he chased him through my back garden and caught him around the block - but the route was like an assault course."" A Richmond Police spokesman said: ""We can confirm that there were two people on a stolen moped that went through a red light and crashed into another vehicle.  ""The males ran off and one was detained by Tom Hardy.  ""Both suspects were initially taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries."" A Metropolitan Police spokesman later clarified the stolen vehicle was a motorbike and that members of the public detained the rider. One of the arrested teenagers was riding pillion, it added. The two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of various motoring offences including taking a vehicle without consent and theft of a motor vehicle, and remain in police custody. A spokeswoman for the 39-year-old actor, who has also starred in films including The Dark Knight Rises, The Revenant, Inception and Legend, declined to comment.

"North Korea faces tighter sanctions under Trump strategy The US is to tighten sanctions on North Korea and step up diplomatic moves aimed at pressuring the country to end its nuclear and missile programmes. President Donald Trump's strategy was announced after a special briefing for all 100 US senators. Earlier, the top US commander in the Pacific defended the deployment of an advanced missile defence system in South Korea. Tensions have risen amid fears the North is planning new weapons tests. ""The United States seeks stability and the peaceful denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,"" said a joint statement issued by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.  ""We remain open to negotiations towards that goal. However, we remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies. ""The president's approach aims to pressure North Korea into dismantling its nuclear, ballistic missile, and proliferation programs by tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with our allies and regional partners,"" the statement added. The US already has extensive sanctions in place on North Korea, including a blanket ban on trade and a blacklist of anyone dealing with North Korea.  It is not clear what further sanctions Washington could impose.  The Americans are deeply concerned about advances in North Korea's weapons technology, they believe it could well be capable of hitting the United States with a nuclear warhead before the end of President Trump's first term.  Any US military intervention to pre-empt that would be fraught with risk, but Mr Trump has toughened his rhetoric to drive home a message that it's a credible threat.  A key part of his plan is to pressure China to lean more heavily on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. The statement says the US is open to negotiations towards that end, but many even in Washington doubt the regime could ever accept such terms.  Democratic Senator Christopher Coons told reporters that military options were discussed at the special presidential briefing for senators. ""It was a sobering briefing in which it was clear just how much thought and planning was going into preparing military options if called for - and a diplomatic strategy that strikes me as clear-eyed and well-proportioned to the threat,"" he said. A White House official said an option under consideration was to put North Korea back on the state department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism. Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, imposed sanctions over a year ago following a nuclear test and satellite launch by the North. North Korean government property in America was frozen and US exports to, or investment in, North Korea was banned. The order also greatly expanded powers to blacklist anyone, including non-Americans, dealing with North Korea.   The senators received a highly unusual briefing by the Trump administration on the seriousness of the threat from North Korea and the president's strategy for dealing with it on Wednesday. Earlier Admiral Harry Harris, head of US Pacific Command, said the US would be ready ""with the best technology"" to defeat any missile threat. The deployment of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system in South Korea was aimed, he argued, at bringing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""to his senses, not to his knees"". Adm Harris said he believed that North Korea would try to attack the US as soon as it had the military capabilities. China says the deployment of Thaad will destabilise security and there have been protests in South Korea itself, where three people were injured in clashes with police as the system was being delivered to a former golf course on Wednesday.",Thursday 27 April 2017,27-Apr-17,US to tighten sanctions on North Korea,Donald Trump's strategy aims to apply both economic and diplomatic pressure on Kim Jong-un.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39723747
"Turkey suspends more than 9,000 police officers over 'Gulen links' Turkey's police force has suspended more than 9,000 officers over alleged links to the US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen. It said the action had been taken on the grounds of national security. President Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating a failed coup against him last July - a charge the cleric denies.   Earlier, authorities detained more than 1,000 people in the latest operation against alleged Gulen supporters. The nationwide sweep was one of the largest such operations carried out in Turkey in months. As well as the 1,009 detained on Wednesday, arrest warrants were issued for another 3,224 people, as part of a police operation across Turkey's 81 provinces, reports said. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the raids were targeting a Gulenist network ""that infiltrated our police force, called 'secret imams'"". In the aftermath of the 15 July coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended. They included soldiers, police, teachers, and public servants - all of whom were accused of having links with militant groups. The latest purge comes just over a week after President Erdogan narrowly won a controversial referendum on increasing his powers. Opponents fear the victory, which has bitterly divided Turkey, brings him closer to authoritarian rule. Two days after the referendum, Turkey's parliament extended a nine-month state of emergency by a further three months. It was widely expected that the post-coup purge would accelerate once President Erdogan achieved the referendum victory he wanted.  He feels emboldened and there's no longer a risk of jeopardising potential referendum votes. No matter that the opposition still contests the referendum results, and their claim of widespread fraud is backed by a scathing report from election observers. The president says the result is final.  So on Wednesday the police bore the brunt of the detentions, but other institutions are likely to follow suit.  The governing AKP party was full of Gulen supporters when Mr Erdogan and the cleric were staunch allies.  It hasn't yet been purged and could now be targeted. And even if not, the threat will be dangled over potential opponents like a sword of Damocles: speak out and your Gulen affiliation will be exposed. The scale of the ""anti-Gulen"" arrests has raised alarm in Europe, and stalled Turkey's bid to join the EU. After the latest sweep, Germany's foreign ministry said it had ""taken note of the mass detentions with concern"".",Thursday 27 April 2017,27-Apr-17,"Turkey suspends 9,000 police in crackdown",The latest purge is over alleged links to US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39723371
"100 days: America in a time of Trump Presidential elections are always something of a national Rorschach test.  The reaction to candidates, like the perception of inkblots, helps to divulge the nation's character, underlying disorders and emotional condition. Donald Trump's unexpected victory showed that America had a split personality. It also revealed that, among his 62 million supporters, rage and fear were over-riding emotions. Make America Great Again not only became a mission statement but a nostalgic catch-all. For many of his white working-class supporters, it implied a return to an era when the homeland was more homogenised and the world was less globalised.  The first 100 days of an administration, though in many ways a bogus measure, can also be diagnostic. They can reveal the character of a presidency and set the tone.  Also they are indicative of the health of US democracy: the functioning of its institutions, executive, legislative and judicial; the workability of the US constitution and the dispersion of political, economic and cultural power.  Inauguration day was a celebration for some, a convulsion for others. What is the state of the nation now?  What has become clear since Donald Trump delivered his inaugural address is that he has changed the presidency more than the presidency has changed him.  The vocabulary of President Trump, if not all his policies, is much the same as that of candidate Trump. To the White House he has brought the same aggression and plain speaking that characterised his insurgent campaign.  Social media remains his favoured conduit with the American people. Twitter is to Trump what television was to JFK and radio was to FDR. But it is his means of expression, more than the utilisation of a new medium, that marks such a break from the past.  At his inaugural ball he vowed to keep tweeting. By choosing Frank Sinatra's My Way for his first dance, he also gave us a musical clue as to how he would govern. Trump would be Trump. The anti-politician had morphed into the anti-president.  His so-far unsubstantiated allegation that Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of Trump Tower - ""Bad (or sick) guy!"" he tweeted - emphasised how he does not feel bound by presidential protocols or conventions. Here he disdained the longstanding tradition that incumbent presidents avoid savage attacks on their predecessors.  From his ongoing refusal to release his tax returns to his stonewalling of requests to disclose visitor logs at the White House, he has indicated normal rules do not apply to him.  All this continues to horrify his critics but not most of his supporters. They voted for unorthodoxy, and seem to have granted him dispensation to flout norms so long as he delivers results.  And yet, he has received highest marks when he is at his most conventionally presidential. His speech to the joint session of Congress, which was similar in language and tone to normal State of the Union addresses, was probably the highpoint of his first 100 days. It got far better reviews than his inaugural, both from Republicans and some Democrats.  His decision to strike Syria also trod the path of orthodoxy. Cool-headed and cogent, his late-night statement explaining his decision to strike was also standard presidential fare. Even some of his detractors remarked how in these two moments he truly assumed the mantles of president and commander-in-chief.  Lauded by many Democrats who wished Obama had enforced his red line on chemical weapons, the strike on Syria angered some hardline loyalists.  Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Michael Cernovich, a self-styled ""American nationalist"", were dismayed that pictures of dying children moved him so easily and that he acted like a neo-conservative rather than a neo-isolationist. Unsurprisingly perhaps, conformism infuriates the alt-right. Flip-flops on Syria, Chinese currency manipulation and Nato have made Trump's foreign policy appear erratic and incoherent. The confusion over whether or not his administration continues to support a two-state solution in the Middle East displayed a lack of clarity that perplexed foreign diplomats. His congratulations to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following a referendum granting him more authoritarian powers was markedly different from the cautious reaction of European leaders. Ahead of the French presidential election, Trump said of Marine Le Pen ""she's the strongest on borders and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France"". His words, which came close to an endorsement, prompted this shocked response from former Bush speechwriter David Frum: ""Collect jaw from floor, reinsert in head.""  Had one of his predecessors implied support for a far-right candidate, the political storm would have lasted days, and possibly overshadowed their entire presidency. But the response to Trump's remarks was more like a passing shower. It spoke of how quickly the abnormal has become quotidian under this presidency. There's an argument to be made that Trump is at his most successful in foreign affairs when he's at his most unpredictable for the simple reason that is when he's most feared. The Assad regime will surely hesitate before ordering another chemical strike.  Nato's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he's already seeing the effect of Trump's focus on financial burden-sharing within the military alliance. The American aid worker Aya Hijazi was released after three years in detention only when Trump raised her case with President Sisi.  At the United Nations, there's a new focus on reform, especially of peacekeeping operations. This is partly because there is a new reformist Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, but mainly because of the fear that the US, by far the organisation's biggest donor, could pull funding. Trump has brought a fear factor to the American presidency often absent during the Obama years.  Richard Nixon labelled this kind of strategic unpredictability the Madman Theory, and saw it as an essential diplomatic tool. Communist bloc leaders, the theory went, would not provoke America because of the unpredictability of the president's response. It might be crazed. Nuclear even. But the fact that Nixon used this approach in Vietnam shows its shortcomings. In the present context, it's a risky approach to apply to North Korea, but the Trump administration clearly believes ""the era of strategic patience"" towards Kim Jong-un is over, and that sabre rattling will jolt Beijing into pressuring Pyongyang. The next 100 days, presumably, will tell.   Overall, there's a ""good cop, bad cop"" dynamic to the Trump administration's diplomacy. Mainstream foreign policy types such as Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson adopt the more conventional approach. Trump lends menace, often through his tweets.  Sometimes the very administration seems to have a split personality. Yet the first 100 days have probably yielded more results in the foreign realm than the domestic. Noticeable in these first 100 days has been the corporatisation of the presidency. There's a chairman-of-the-board feel to his daily routine, with its meetings and photo opportunities that often place him in a leather-backed chair in the presidential boardroom - the West Wing basically has two, the Roosevelt Room and the Cabinet Room - surrounded by corporate chiefs. His cabinet is also packed with fellow billionaires and multi-millionaires.  This raises the question of whether a super-rich president at the head of a super-rich cabinet can remain a working-class hero in the all-important Rust Belt. After spending time last week in the Ohio River Valley, which is dotted with derelict steelworks, what struck me was how few of his supporters cared. ""No-one works for a poor man,"" said one Trump devotee. There's a nagging sense one business that's undoubtedly seen an uptick is Trump Inc.  Potential conflicts of interests abound, and it is hard sometimes to differentiate where the presidency ends and the family business begins.  There's been criticism that Trump spends so much time at resorts owned by the Trump Organization. The mixing of business with the presidency could yet be his undoing . An aim of staffing the administration with so many executives was to vest government with corporate know-how and efficiency. But this presidential start-up has been surprisingly accident-prone, critics would say incompetent.  Whether with big-ticket items such as the original travel ban or fairly trivial matters, like misspelling Theresa May's name in a White House memo handed to reporters, it has often shown itself to be slapdash.  Turf battles between hardline figures like Steve Bannon and moderates like Jared Kushner also belie Trump's boast that it is a ""fine-tuned machine"". David Brooks, a conservative columnist for the New York Times, has labelled it ""a golden age of malfunction"". When a new administration fumbles what should have been a pro-forma presidential statement marking Holocaust Remembrance Day you sense there is a problem. When the White House spokesman claims that Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his own people, it suggests it has lost the historical plot. These last examples showed not only a disregard for detail but also an apparent disdain for truth. The first 100 days has produced a litany of falsehoods. A scorecard compiled by the website Politifact found that of Trump's statements 69% were either mostly false, false or ""pants on fire"".  Alternative facts: Kellyanne Conway was lampooned when she first used this Orwellian-sounding phrase, but it perfectly captured the twilight zone of truth often found at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Under Donald Trump, the White House is no longer a reliable source. Victories are often lost in the swirl of controversy. Illegal crossings over the southern border have fallen sharply, by 40% during the first month of Trump's presidency, according to the Department of Homeland Security.  That's the steepest decline since 2009. With immigration arrests up by almost a third in the first month, there's a feeling among his supporters that he is delivering on his pledge to protect America's border, even if construction has not yet started on his famed wall.  Trump would argue he has already made the homeland safer. A by-product of Trump's troubled presidential launch has been to burnish the reputations of his predecessors. For Democrats, the idolatry of Barack Obama gathers pace. George Herbert Walker Bush, recently ailing in hospital, has become even more of a revered national elder.  His son, George W, the one-time Toxic Texan, has been subject to some speedy historical revisionism. Not only has his newly published collection of portraits of wounded warriors won acclaim, as a work of the hand and the heart, his reported remarks at Trump's inauguration - ""That was some weird sh**"" - have come close to making him a folk hero of the left.  Might Trump one day be subject to this kind of reassessment? The hostile commentary on him is similar to the scorn heaped on Ronald Reagan. Yet the movie star president is now widely seen as the leader who, by winning the Cold War, ended America's long national nightmare after Vietnam and Watergate.  Lyndon Baines Johnson was pilloried as a racist vulgarian, but nonetheless enacted transformative legislation such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act, dismantling segregation, and launching Medicare.  History remembers John F Kennedy's early presidency for the elegance of his inaugural address and the photogenic beauty of his New Frontier, but his first months in office were full of missteps.  They included the Bay of Pigs, a string of congressional setbacks and a disastrous summit with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, which emboldened the Soviet leader to build the Berlin Wall. While Trump cannot yet boast much of a record of accomplishment in these first 100 days, there are still 1361 to go. A ""civics lesson from hell"" was how the Harvard academic Louis Menand described the contested aftermath of the 2000 presidential election, with its hanging chads, thwarted recounts and litigation. Not since the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in Bush versus Gore has the US constitution faced such a stress test.  Now, as then, we have learned where power in America truly lies, and how the checks and balances hard-wired into the US system operate in practice.  Donald Trump's executive power has continually been constrained. After signing that early executive order banning entrants from seven mainly Muslim countries, the courts intervened to block him.  It was an early constitutional test. But although Trump railed against the ""so-called judges"" who thwarted him, using unusually vehement language, his administration abided by the court's decision and kept within the law. With the checks and balances working as the founding fathers intended, a constitutional crisis was averted. With Trumpcare, it wasn't the courts that blocked Trump but Congress. As he sought to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump could not even secure a simple majority in a House of Representatives under Republican control.  Had his healthcare proposals cleared that hurdle in the lower house, parts of the reform package would have run into trouble in the Senate. There the Republicans also enjoy a majority but not one big enough to enact bills into law without bipartisan support. With the legislative branch restraining the executive branch, again the constitution worked as intended. The Republican leadership, frustrated by these checks, successfully removed one of them: the use of the filibuster in blocking nominees to America's highest court - in this instance, Trump's nominee Neil Gorsuch.  This did not involve an amendment to the constitution, rather a revision of Senate rules, but it was nonetheless momentous. This nuclear option, as it is called, delivered a clear win for the president: the elevation of Judge Gorsuch to the bench. However, the filibuster remains intact to block his legislative agenda, and Democrats will use it to thwart Trump. In recent years, as Washington has become more ungovernable, there's been a growing literature about the inoperability of the constitution, and how its checks and balances have acted more like spanners in the works.  Just as Republicans, the great practitioners of the politics of No, used the constitution to stymie Barack Obama, Democrats are relying upon it to impede Donald Trump. For them, the constitution must now seem timeless and timely. A number of Democrats have told me that the genius of the Founding Fathers was to anticipate this kind of presidency.  In these first 100 days, we have been reminded of the power of states and municipalities. We have seen an inversion of the doctrine of states' rights. For decades, states' rights was the battle-cry of white supremacists determined to uphold segregation in defiance of federal court orders demanding integration. Now progressive states are using this principle.  Some of the biggest cities in the country, including Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, are wilfully obstructing Trump's immigration crackdown. Thus, sanctuary cities have become to the progressive left what segregationist citadels were to the racist right, emblematic battlefields in a tug of war between local government and the federal government.   Similar battle-lines have been marked out over climate change.  Protest power has also emerged as a significant force, as something akin to a national passion play has unfolded on the streets. The sea of pink pussy hats at the massive women's marches on the first weekend of the presidency vividly highlighted a new sense of personal political empowerment: people ready to take matters into their own hands.  The speed at which demonstrators congregated at US airports in the immediate aftermath of the ban surely had an emboldening effect on the state attorneys general who successfully challenged it in the courts.  The death certificate of Trumpcare may have been signed in the House of Representatives, but mortal wounds were inflicted in those angry town meetings, which alarmed Republican lawmakers. Maybe one of the reasons President Donald Trump has not yet returned to Trump Tower in Manhattan is the fear of massive demonstrations in the city of his birth. For the past eight years, popular anger was on the right of US politics. Now it is on the left. The pertinent political question over the coming years will be to what extent the Democratic Party can harness this street agitation. Will there be a Tea-Party-style mobilisation of progressives that translates into real political power? Or are opponents of Donald Trump pinning more faith in pressure groups than the Democratic Party?  The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, has witnessed a fundraising bonanza. The ACLU raked in $24m (£18.7m) in online donations the weekend after the first travel ban, six times the amount it normally raises in a year.   Constrained by Congress, the courts and his own party, so far this has not been an imperial presidency, the phrase coined by the historian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr to describe the Nixon White House, which was accused, even before the Watergate break-in, of pushing constitutional bounds.  Rather it has been an inhibited presidency, in which Donald Trump has been made all too aware of the limits of his executive power. Donald Trump's promise to Make America Great Again was primarily an economic pledge, and there were early signs of a Trump Bump on Wall Street and Main Street.  Just three trading days after the new president took the oath of office, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through the 20,000 mark for the first time in its history. Investors expected him to slash corporate taxes and set fire to business regulations. Not since 2000, a report suggested last month, has consumer confidence been so buoyant. This rosy soft data has not been matched by hard economic data. The US economy added just 98,000 jobs in March, almost half of what some economists expected. Industrial production and housing starts were lower than expected.  Retail sales, which should have risen with consumer confidence, actually fell by 0.2% in March, their first decline in over a year. The markets, having watched the healthcare debacle, are no longer so confident Trump can deliver lower corporate tax rates and a $1tn infrastructure spend. Barron's, the weekly financial newspaper, recently opined: ""Trump bump, we hardly knew ye."" As for the impact of Trump's ""Buy American, Hire American"" doctrine, it is too early to judge. Industry groups have voiced concerns it will raise costs, making it prohibitively expensive to build the new bridges and roads. The tech sector is worried Hire American policies will block or discourage high-skilled immigrants. The tourism industry is reporting a ""Trump Slump,"" because of the off-putting effect of the travel ban and its author. After signalling his willingness to name and shame corporations accused of exporting US jobs abroad or stiffing the federal government, there's evidence it has had a chastening effect. Presumably, no senior executive of a publicly traded company wants to reach for their smartphone in the morning to find their name on his Twitter feed, if only because of the effect it can have on the share price.  Boeing, a company that Trump shamed publicly during the transition, says it's made progress with the administration over bringing down the costs of the replacement for Air Force One. The Trump administration also claims to have created jobs by pressuring major corporations to invest in new American plants.  Most of these expansion plans were in place, however, before Barack Obama left office.  That's true of Ford's Michigan investment, ExxonMobil's Gulf Coast expansion, and Intel's Arizona plant, all of which were touted by the administration as totems of Trumpism.  Arguably, the main effect of his self-congratulatory tweets about saving US jobs has been political rather than economic.  It has persuaded blue-collar voters that this billionaire populist is battling on their behalf. As for his tweets lambasting business? They've created a love/fear relationship with the corporate sector, which welcomes his deregulation and proposed tax cuts but not necessarily his efforts to roll back globalisation. One sector that has undoubtedly benefited from a Trump bump is the media. The New York Times and Washington Post have seen subscriptions soar. CNN, a network of which obituaries were being written only a few years ago, is enjoying a ratings windfall. Twitter, whose once stagnant user numbers have risen, is finally winning again. Despite high-profile exits, Fox News remains the most influential news channel in America, if only because its breakfast show Fox and Friends is what Trump watches in the morning. Overall, the response of the US journalistic community to Trump's presidency has been to become more adversarial. Reporters like Jim Acosta, anchors like Jake Tapper, and even mild-mannered Wolf Blitzer have adopted a more hard-edged approach. The New York Times has replaced bland headlines with more judgemental wording.  A headline three days into his presidency signalled its new approach: Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers.  Elsewhere, cultural lines are being blurred, an inevitable response perhaps to a president who turned politics in a new reality show genre. Comedians, faced with the dilemma of satirising a self-satirising White House, have adopted a more journalistic persona. John Oliver and Samantha Bee mix gags with serious reportage, much of it directed against Trump.  Stephen Colbert, who struggled at first as David Letterman's successor after shedding his mock right-wing persona, may overtake apolitical Jimmy Fallon in the late-night ratings.  The mimicry of Alec Baldwin and the casting of Melissa McCarthy as Sean ""Spicey"" Spicer have once again made SNL appointment viewing. In the arts, the expectation is that Trump will produce a burst of creativity, in line with the ""Take your broken heart, make it into art"" plea from Meryl Streep at this year's Golden Globes. But much of that art, whether paintings, screenplays or novels, may still be unfinished.   Just as we await the great Trump-era movie - a Doctor Strangelove, The Deer Hunter or Wall Street - there's not yet been a great Trump-inspired novel. For now, literary classics are filling the void. George Orwell's 1984, with an assist from Kellyanne Conway's ""alternative facts"", rose to the top of best-seller lists. Philip Roth's The Plot Against America, which imagines as president Charles Lindbergh, the aviator who became the spokesman of the America First Committee in the early years of World War Two, has also enjoyed a revival. Hulu is streaming a dramatisation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which imagines a totalitarian America. On Broadway, a stage adaptation of 1984 is in the works.  Then there has been the unexpected success of Come From Away, a feel good 9/11 musical of all things, which tells the story of the nearly 7,000 airline passengers stranded in Gander, Newfoundland, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.  Foot-tapping and tear-jerking, the show is all about making outsiders feel at home. Rather pointedly, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took Ivanka Trump to see it.  Next month unveils the fifth season of House of Cards, but in the wake of accusations of Russian meddling, its plotlines, once considered so outlandish, now seem more run-of-the-mill, a case perhaps of life overtaking art.  To journey from the major coastal cities into the American heartland feels right now like travelling between different countries. There has long been two Americas, one that favours pick-up trucks over Prius hybrids, Walmart over Whole Foods, Duck Dynasty over This American Life. This age of Trump, as well as accentuating those divisions, has brought with it new identifying markers.  Do you wear a scarlet Make America Great Again baseball cap or a pink woollen hat? Would you buy an Ivanka Trump dress? Do you agree with Alex Jones, the host of the far-right Infowars, or Van Jones, CNN's leading pundit? Or, more simply, do you have faith in the president? Increasingly, how you respond to Trump determines which America you inhabit. Barack Obama entered office vowing to bring together red and blue state America, though he was a deeply polarising figure who singularly failed in that endeavour. Donald Trump has not tried particularly hard to be a unifying figure.  His travel largely has been to states that voted for him. Many of his appearances outside the White House and Mar-a-Lago have essentially been campaign rallies. His Attorney General Jeff Sessions, angry that a judge had challenged the latest travel ban, even referred to Hawaii, which achieved statehood in 1959, as ""an island in the Pacific"".  My own travels around the country, mainly into the Bible and Rust Belt, suggest he remains strong in the regions that sent him to the White House. Last week on the Ohio River Valley, businessmen told me how the Trump Bump is for real. They see it on their balance sheets, with the relaxation of Environmental Protection Agency rules over coal often cited as the reason for the turnaround.  Many Rust Belt voters continue to adore Trump because liberals hate him so. They voted for the billionaire partly to punch sneering bicoastal liberals in the nose. They are enjoying the sight of elite blood being shed in such quantities.   Because of the shadow cast by the Russian allegations, these first 100 days have sometimes felt like the final days of an ailing administration. Trump is routinely cast as a modern-day Richard Nixon. Yet while it is difficult sometimes to see how this administration can remain viable in its present form, it is harder to imagine how it would be brought to a premature end. Barring some catastrophic revelation emerging from the FBI's investigation into Team Trump's alleged links with the Kremlin or some massive financial scandal, the Republican leadership is unlikely to move against him. In the unlikely event that it launched impeachment proceedings, here the constitution is his friend.  It is hard to dislodge an incumbent president. The Founding Fathers, who came up with a governing model that has constrained Trump, also came up with an electoral model, the Electoral College, which has already helped him and may do so again. That will be true if the Rust Belt remains a stronghold. My overwhelming sense, based on the popular vote in November and opinion polls since, is that more Americans are anti-Trump than pro.  But my sense also is that many blue-collar battlers remain fiercely loyal. So to write him off would be to repeat the same analytical mistake commentators have made since he first announced for the presidency, that of underestimation.  For while Democrats regard their new president as a national embarrassment, many of his supporters continue to view him as a potential national saviour.  One hundred days into a presidency the like of which this country has never seen before, the state of the union is disunion.

"'Exciting' blood test spots cancer a year early Doctors have spotted cancer coming back up to a year before normal scans in an ""exciting"" discovery. The UK team was able to scour the blood for signs of cancer while it was just a tiny cluster of cells invisible to X-ray or CT scans. It should allow doctors to hit the tumour earlier and increase the chances of a cure.  They also have new ideas for drugs after finding how unstable DNA fuels rampant cancer development. The research project was on lung cancer, but the processes studied are so fundamental that they should apply across all cancer types.  Lung cancer kills more people than any other type of tumour and the point of the study is to track how it can ""evolve"" into a killer that spreads through the body.  In order to test for cancer coming back, doctors need to know what to look for.  In the trial, funded by Cancer Research UK, samples were taken from the lung tumour when it was removed during surgery.  A team at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, then analysed the tumour's defective DNA to build up a genetic fingerprint of each patient's cancer.  Then blood tests were taken every three months after the surgery to see if tiny traces of cancer DNA re-emerged. The results, outlined in the journal Nature, showed cancer recurrence could be detected up to a year before any other method available to medicine.  The tumours are thought to have a volume of just 0.3 cubic millimetres when the blood test catches them. Dr Christopher Abbosh, from the UCL Cancer Institute, said: ""We can identify patients to treat even if they have no clinical signs of disease, and also monitor how well therapies are working. ""This represents new hope for combating lung cancer relapse following surgery, which occurs in up to half of all patients."" So far, it has been an early warning system for 13 out of 14 patients whose illness recurred, as well as giving others an all-clear.  In theory, it should be easier to kill the cancer while it is still tiny rather than after it has grown and become visible again. However, this needs testing. Prof Charles Swanton, from the Francis Crick Institute, told the BBC: ""We can now set up clinical trials to ask the fundamental question - if you treat people's disease when there's no evidence of cancer on a CT scan or a chest X-ray can we increase the cure rate? ""We hope that by treating the disease when there are very few cells in the body that we'll be able to increase the chance of curing a patient."" Janet Maitland, 65, from London, is one of the patients taking part in the trial. She has watched lung cancer take the life of her husband and was diagnosed herself last year.  She told the BBC: ""It was my worst nightmare getting lung cancer, and it was like my worse nightmare came true, so I was devastated and terrified.""  But she had the cancer removed and now doctors say she has a 75% chance of being cancer-free in five years. ""It's like going from terror to joy, from thinking that I was never going to get better to feeling like a miracle's been acted,"" she said. And taking part in a trial that should improve the chances for patients in the future is a huge comfort for her. ""I feel very privileged,"" she added. The blood test is actually the second breakthrough in the massive project to deepen understanding of lung cancer. A bigger analysis, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed the key factor - genetic instability - that predicted whether the cancer would return. Multiple samples from 100 patients containing 4.5 trillion base pairs of DNA were analysed.  DNA is packaged up into sets of chromosomes containing thousands of genetic instructions. The team at the Francis Crick Institute showed tumours with more ""chromosomal chaos"" - the ability to readily reshuffle large amounts of their DNA to alter thousands of genetic instructions - were those most likely to come back. Prof Charles Swanton, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""You've got a system in place where a cancer cell can alter its behaviour very rapidly by gaining or losing whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes. ""It is evolution on steroids."" That allows the tumour to develop resistance to drugs, the ability to hide from the immune system or the skills to move to other tissues in the body. The first implication of the research is for drug development - by understanding the key role of chromosomal instability, scientists can find ways to stop it. Prof Swanton told me: ""I hope we'll be able to generate new approaches to limit it and bring evolution back from the brink, perhaps reduce the evolutionary capacity of tumours and hopefully stop them adapting. ""It's exciting on multiple levels."" The scientists say they are only scratching the surface of what can be achieved by analysing the DNA of cancers.

"Trump seeks tax windfall for business The Trump administration has proposed slashing the rate of corporation tax with the aim of spurring economic growth, the Treasury Secretary said. Steven Mnuchin unveiled President Trump's blueprint, which aims to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15%.  Economists say the policy would add trillions of dollars to the deficit over the next decade. But Mr Mnuchin said the tax plan would pay for itself ""through growth, through deductions and closing loopholes"". Secretary Mnuchin, joined White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn on Wednesday to announce the tax proposal, which he billed as ""the biggest tax cut"" in history, but it is unclear whether that will really prove to be the case. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump released a tax plan that was fairly traditional by Republican standards and fairly light on details.  Now the Trump administration has released a new, different tax plan. It is also fairly traditional by Republican standards and equally vague.  The White House wants taxes to go down, but for whom? And how will it be paid for?  ""We will let you know the details at the appropriate moment,"" Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said during the unveiling of the one-page, bullet-pointed outline. Political devils love to hide in such details. What seems certain is that, like the recent healthcare debate, the forthcoming tax battle will set Republicans at each other's throats.  While conservatives traditionally have never met a tax cut they didn't like, many in Congress have taken strong positions in recent years against adding to the budget deficit.  Mr Trump's proposals will surely balloon the deficit unless they're offset elsewhere, which will take more than the promised economic growth and loophole closing. Once again, the heavy lifting on policy is left to Congress. The end result may not look at all like today's plan - and, like healthcare, it may prove difficult to pass. The Republican president's plan will act as a guide for Congress as they try to pass a tax reform bill in the months ahead. It could face resistance from fiscal hawks within his own party. Democrats are highlighting the fact that Mr Trump's own tax liability from his businesses would shrink under his blueprint, saving him millions. Democratic Party chairman Tom Perez renewed a call for Mr Trump to release his tax returns to better understand how much he would gain from the plan.  ""We must know how much Trump would personally financially benefit from his own proposal,"" he said.  Also mentioned in the president's broad outline: What will Trump's tax plan actually do? Mr Trump's blueprint is not expected to include any proposals for raising new revenue. The much-discussed border tax that would put a tariff on imports - favoured by House Speaker Paul Ryan - will not be in the plan. And nor will Mr Trump's $1tn (£779bn) infrastructure improvement plan feature. The White House is also working to include an expanded child and development care credit, for which Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, has advocated. Democrats are not expected to back a plan which adds to the national debt. That means Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, may be forced to work under a budget procedure which allows them to proceed without them. President Trump would like to see Congress pass tax reform by the middle of autumn, says the White House.  Republican lawmaker Kevin Brady, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee and co-chairs Congress' tax-writing panels, praised the broad tax outline.  ""I think the bolder the better in tax reform,"" he said. ""I'm excited that the president is going for a very ambitious plan.""  Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, questioned whether lowering tax rates for small businesses, known as S corporations or ""pass through"" businesses, was beneficial.  Though ""pass through"" entities are typically small businesses, parts of Mr Trump's own real estate conglomerate also qualify, giving Democrats more ammunition in opposing the plan.  Democrats have also criticised Mr Mnuchin's claim that economic growth would create enough new tax revenue to cover the corporate tax cuts.  Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown called the 15% rate workable only ""if you want to blow a hole in the federal budget and cut a whole lot of things like Meals on Wheels and Lake Erie restoration and then lie about the growth rate of the economy"". California Democrat Ted Lieu described the proposal as ""mathematically impossible"".",Thursday 27 April 2017,27-Apr-17,Trump seeks tax windfall for business,Analysts say the plan will add trillions to the deficit but the US government says growth will fund it.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39721344
"Ann Coulter's Berkeley speech cancelled a day beforehand US conservative commentator Ann Coulter has cancelled a speech at the University of California, Berkeley, after a bitter free-speech row. The pro-Trump author had been due to talk about immigration on Thursday. On 19 April, school administrators said the risk of violent protests meant they could not provide a safe venue.  Ms Coulter, who had originally vowed to visit the campus anyway, changed her mind after the event's organisers withdrew their support. The Berkeley campus has witnessed destructive protests in recent months - not least over a planned appearance by alt-right poster-boy and outspoken Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos. Rather than cancelling Ms Coulter's speech altogether, university authorities had asked her to hold it next week and at an earlier time, when the risk of clashes was lower.  The organisers of the event, the Young America's Foundation (YAF) and Berkeley College Republicans, then said they would sue the university. The lawsuit claimed that Berkeley administrators were trying to ""burden or ban"" events ""involving the expression of conservative viewpoints"". However, the YAF backtracked late on Tuesday, saying it could no longer sponsor the talk.  ""Young America's Foundation will not jeopardise the safety of its staff or students,"" the group said. ""Berkeley should be ashamed for creating this hostile atmosphere."" Ms Coulter, whose 2015 book is titled Adios, America!: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole, tweeted that free speech had been ""crushed by thugs"". ""Everyone who should believe in free speech fought against it or ran away,"" she said. Ms Coulter has said the US is being ""overwhelmed"" by immigration. She was due to speak against it on Thursday. Berkeley's chancellor wrote to students saying the university ""did not cancel the Coulter event and has never prohibited Ms Coulter from coming on campus"". Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said the only reason she could not speak on Thursday was because the venue available was not safe; it could not be cordoned off, he said, and had floor-to-ceiling glass.",Thursday 27 April 2017,27-Apr-17,Pro-Trump Coulter cancels Berkeley speech,University officials said they could not guarantee a safe venue for the conservative commentator.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39727531
"Missing Taiwanese trekker found in Himalayas after 47 days A 21-year-old trekker from Taiwan has been rescued alive in the Himalayas, 47 days after he and his girlfriend went missing. A high-altitude search and rescue team found Liang Sheng Yueh in a canyon at around 2,600m (8,500ft) near Tipling village in Nepal's Dhading district. The body of his companion, 19-year-old Liu Chen Chun, was lying nearby.  Mr Liang is being treated at Grandee International Hospital in Kathmandu and is said to be out of danger.  Dr Sanjaya Karki, who is treating Mr Liang, told Surendra Phuyal of BBC Nepal: ""He can speak slowly. He told me his girlfriend died three days ago. He doesn't have trauma injuries, but his body has injuries stemming from worm-bites."" The trekker is said to have lost 30kg (4.5 stone) since going missing seven weeks ago. His hair was full of lice when he was found, and one foot was covered with maggots. Doctors said he appeared to have survived largely on water and salt. The BBC has learned that the stricken travellers were first sighted at 11:00 local time (05:15 GMT) by local people. A helicopter was immediately sent to the scene. Mr Liang and Ms Liu, first year students at Taiwan's National Dong Hwa University, had arrived in Nepal in February from India.    They were last seen in northern Dhading on 9 March, where they had gone out trekking despite heavy snowfall. The website Missingtrekker.com reported that the couple had experienced some hardships before their trek, including missing luggage, and argued over ""trivial matters"". Ms Liu reportedly wrote on Facebook: ""I wish I had never ended up here."" The pair's families became concerned when they failed to call Taiwan as arranged on 10 March, and requested official help to find them five days later.  Nepalese police hired three guides and a helicopter to search for the students, who were believed to be travelling to meet Taiwanese friends in Langtang village. According to the Taipei Times, Himalayan travel guides and local news outlets were also alerted to the situation, but ongoing snowfall and sporadic avalanches made an extensive search difficult. Madhav Basnet, who was part of the rescue operation, told the BBC the two trekkers appeared to have ""slid off a slippery trail while making an ascent towards Ghatlang village from Dhading"".

"France election: Macron heckled by pro-Le Pen workers French presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron has been heckled by factory workers in Amiens after a visit by his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen. Ms Le Pen upstaged her centrist rival earlier by turning up to speak to the workers as he met their union representatives a few miles away. Mr Macron, who is far ahead in opinion polls, is in Amiens, his home town, amid accusations of complacency. He got another boost when former President Nicolas Sarkozy endorsed him.  François Fillon, the candidate of Mr Sarkozy's own, centre-right Republican party, was knocked out in the first round, leaving uncertainty over how party supporters would vote in the second.  Opinion polls taken since the first round on Sunday suggest Mr Macron, candidate of the En Marche (On The Move) movement, will easily beat Ms Le Pen, who has temporarily stood down as leader of the National Front. %  Emmanuel  Macron  %  Marine  Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart. The polling average line  looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower. This was a neat publicity coup for Marine Le Pen. As Emmanuel Macron was holding talks at the local chamber of commerce, the National Front leader made an unannounced visit to the picket line at the Whirlpool factory where she was greeted with enthusiasm by many of the striking workers.   She told reporters there that Mr Macron's decision to meet union officials in the comfortable surroundings of an office - rather than come to the factory gates as she had - was a sign of someone who deep down was contemptuous of  working people's lives.   Mr Macron retorted that Marine Le Pen was cynically exploiting the situation for political ends and that it was more important to work out a  long-term solution for the factory than to score cheap points in front of the cameras.   The clash is symptomatic of a second-round campaign in which so far Marine Le Pen has clearly had the initiative. Some in Mr Macron's camp are urging him to up his game and not assume that his strong lead in the polls will necessarily endure. The Whirlpool household appliance factory in Amiens, in the rustbelt of France's industrial north, faces the threat of closure with outsourcing to Poland.  Mr Macron earlier saw union delegates at the local chamber of commerce, with TV pictures showing them in discussion in a grey meeting room. Meanwhile, Ms Le Pen was having selfies taken outside the actual factory a few miles away. When he visited the actual factory, surrounded by journalists, he was booed and whistled. ""There is no work!"" a woman shouted repeatedly as he sought to address the workers. ""It's important not to feed anger but to be up to meeting expectations,"" he told the crowd. ""Of course there's anger in the country, there's anguish, there's a responsibility to take, that's why I'm here."" Ms Le Pen, whose new campaign slogan is ""Choose France"", tweeted (in French) photos of her meeting the workers and said: ""With me, their factory won't close!""  She seeks to portray her pro-EU opponent as the candidate of ""runaway globalisation"", hoping to pick up votes from the extreme left despite her own far-right background. Leading members of the ruling Socialist Party have criticised Mr Macron, a former Socialist minister, for not fighting hard enough in the run-off campaign. ""He was smug,"" Socialist Party boss Jean-Christophe Cambadelis told French radio. ""He wrongly thought that it was a done deal. It's not a done deal."" In a statement (in French) on Facebook, Mr Sarkozy said he would vote for Mr Macron and was retiring from politics himself. ""I consider that the election of Marine Le Pen and the launch of her project will bring serious consequences to our country and to the French,"" he wrote. ""I will therefore be voting in the second round of the presidential election for Emmanuel Macron. It's a choice of responsibility, which is not in any case a support for his project.""

"Trump 'considering draft order to scrap Nafta' The Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would withdraw the US from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), US media say. It is unclear whether President Donald Trump will follow through and strike down the deal, which eliminated tariffs between the US, Mexico and Canada. In the election he vowed to withdraw from the 23-year-old pact, calling it a US job killer. He pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in January. According to Politico, two White House officials said the Nafta draft order could be unveiled this week or early next week. It is not clear whether the administration is simply floating the proposal as a hardball negotiating tactic, however. The plan comes days after the US imposed a new tariff on softwood lumber coming from Canada. Mr Trump also called a new Canadian tariff regime affecting US dairy products a ""disgrace"".

"Trump 'considering draft order to scrap Nafta' The Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would withdraw the US from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), US media say. It is unclear whether President Donald Trump will follow through and strike down the deal, which eliminated tariffs between the US, Mexico and Canada. In the election he vowed to withdraw from the 23-year-old pact, calling it a US job killer. He pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in January. According to Politico, two White House officials said the Nafta draft order could be unveiled this week or early next week. It is not clear whether the administration is simply floating the proposal as a hardball negotiating tactic, however. The plan comes days after the US imposed a new tariff on softwood lumber coming from Canada. Mr Trump also called a new Canadian tariff regime affecting US dairy products a ""disgrace"". On Tuesday, the US lost a trade battle with the other Nafta signatory. The World Trade Organization ruled that Mexico could impose more than $160m (£125m) annually in sanctions against the US on commerce in tuna, capping a dispute dating to 2008.",Thursday 27 April 2017,27-Apr-17,Trump 'has draft order to scrap Nafta',"It is unclear whether President Trump will strike down the deal between the US, Mexico and Canada.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39726574
"IS conflict: Iraqi force 'retakes ancient city of Hatra' An Iraqi paramilitary force says it has recaptured the ancient city of Hatra, which is believed to have been destroyed by Islamic State militants. The Popular Mobilisation announced that its fighters had ""liberated"" the Unesco World Heritage-listed site ""after fierce clashes with the enemy"". The full extent of the damage to Hatra was not immediately clear from a grainy photograph published by the force. IS has bulldozed, blown up and looted pre-Islamic sites it deems idolatrous. Unesco has said the deliberate destruction of Iraq's cultural heritage constitutes a war crime. Shia-led Popular Mobilisation militiamen launched the offensive on Hatra at dawn on Tuesday. By Wednesday afternoon, they had retaken the archaeological site and had advanced to the edge of the adjacent modern town of Hatra, according to an AFP news agency journalist. Hatra, located 290 km (180 miles) north-west of Baghdad and 110km south-west of Mosul, was one of the best-preserved of Iraq's archaeological sites before it was seized by IS in 2014. Possibly founded in the 3rd or 2nd Century BC, it was a religious and trading centre of the Parthian Empire and capital of the first Arab Kingdom. The city's numerous temples, where Hellenistic and Roman architecture were blended with Eastern decorative features, led to it becoming known as the ""House of God"". Its high, thick walls, which were built in a circle and fortified by towers, meanwhile helped it withstand invasions by the Romans in AD116 and 198. It eventually fell to the Persian Sasanian dynasty in AD241. More recently, the site was used in the opening scene of the 1973 horror film, The Exorcist. In March 2015, Iraqi officials said they had received reports from locals that IS had destroyed Hatra. The following month, IS itself released a video showing militants using picks, sledgehammers and assault rifles to destroy Hatra's walls and statues.  In November, a month after launching a major operation to drive IS out of Mosul, Iraqi forces recaptured the ancient city of Nimrud. Much of the site was reduced to rubble, with shattered statues and a ziggurat reduced to a fraction of its size.",Thursday 27 April 2017,27-Apr-17,Iraq force 'retakes ancient city Hatra',The scale of the damage done by IS militants to the site - featured in The Exorcist - is not clear.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39726244

"Maria Sharapova: Russian beats Roberta Vinci on return from doping ban   
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Maria Sharapova won on her return to action after a 15-month doping ban as she beat Roberta Vinci in the first round of the Stuttgart Open. The Russian, who was suspended last March after testing positive for meldonium, beat the Italian 7-5 6-3. There was no noticeable bad reception for the 30-year-old, who responded well to losing her first service game to take a tight opening set in Stuttgart. She broke twice in the second to progress to face Ekaterina Makarova. Sharapova, who hit 11 aces and 39 winners, said: ""I've been waiting for this for a long time.  ""It's the best feeling in the world, those first few seconds before you enter the arena. To know you were walking back out there was special.  ""I spent a long time without hitting any balls. I didn't know when I would be back. I went to school for a little bit, I grew my business and had a normal life. I put the racquet away for a little bit. ""I felt I had to grow as a person and I think I've done that. But this is what I've done for so long. I'm a competitor - that's when I'm at my best."" The decision to give five-time Grand Slam winner Sharapova a wildcard entry for this event, as well as upcoming tournaments in Madrid and Rome, has been questioned by a number of players, including her Italian first-round opponent. However, it has been defended by WTA chief Steve Simon, who said it was in keeping with how former dopers were treated in other sports, adding that she was ""starting at ground zero"". The former world number one will find out on 16 May if she has been given a wildcard for the French Open, which starts on 28 May. After Wednesday's victory, the Russian told BBC Sport that she would ""play in the juniors"" if she had to, to compete at the French Open and Wimbledon in July. ""I think everyone in this room knows what a competitor I am and I don't take anything for granted, and if I get the opportunity to be in a draw then I will take it,"" she added.  ""I'm being offered wildcards from the tournament directors and I'm accepting them to be able to compete in the draw.  ""I'm coming with no ranking and I'm not getting a wildcard to receive a trophy or a golden platter. I have to get through the matches and I still have to win them and that's my job."" Wednesday's match was a positive start to the process of rebuilding her world ranking points against the woman 34th in the world. She was understandably rusty but brushed off a nervous start to break Vinci at the first opportunity after losing her first service game, showing ominous signs with a string of big winners. Vinci was then taken to deuce in every subsequent service game until the pressure finally told, with Sharapova taking a 6-5 lead and then serving out the first set. Sharapova started the second set with another break of serve to win her fourth game in a row and leave Vinci reeling. The Italian held on to take the set to 4-3 but ultimately the Russian's superiority showed with a break to love and an easily won final service game.

"Trump 'backs down' in new short-term spending bill US lawmakers have reached a deal to avert a federal government shutdown after the White House backed off a threat to withhold Obamacare subsidies. The stop-gap bill announced late on Wednesday allows Congress an extra week to reach a final deal to fund the government through September. Congress had until Friday to negotiate a bill to keep the government running. Democrats declared a victory after the White House agreed to continue paying the so-called cost-sharing reductions.  They refused to support the bill unless it allowed for an Obamacare provision that paid health insurance companies to help keep medical costs down for low-income Americans.  The concession comes after President Donald Trump had earlier dropped a demand to include funding for his controversial border wall in the spending bill.  ""The fundamental issue is keeping the government open, that's our focus,"" said North Carolina Republican Patrick McHenry, a top member of the vote-counting team in the House. A vote on the short-term bill, which funds the government until 5 May, could come as early as Thursday.  The Republican-controlled Congress wants to avoid an unpopular government shutdown, which would close national parks and monuments, lay off federal employees and delay tax refund payments.  Democrats may be in the minority in Congress, but they aren't totally powerless.  They have enough votes to block any budget agreement, thereby causing a government shutdown on the eve of Donald Trump's 100th day in office.  That's an outcome the president and his fellow Republicans want to avoid if at all possible.  The prospect that, even with control of all the levers of power in Washington, they can't even keep government functioning normally would be too much of a political embarrassment to bear. Consequently, on two key issues - providing funding for a US-Mexico border wall and cutting an Obamacare-provided insurance subsidy for low-income people - the White House has backed away from earlier demands in order to win some Democratic support and keep the budget ball rolling along. Fights over Obamacare and border security will eventually erupt again, of course.  But every time Mr Trump takes what appears to be a firm stand, accompanied by a string of aggressive tweets, and then quietly backs down, it gives his opponents a bit more confidence that they can go toe-to-toe with the president and prevail. The challenges to Mr Trump's negotiating skills will only get tougher from here. Congressional Republicans said they were nearing a deal to fully fund the government for the 2017 fiscal year, but needed more time to ""finalise"" the package before the midnight deadline on Friday night to keep the lights on in government.  ""I am optimistic that a final funding package will be completed soon,"" House Appropriations chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen said.  The resolution also extends healthcare benefits for retired union coal miners through 5 May. Those benefits would have expired on Friday as well.  The sweeping spending package would combine 11 unfinished spending bills into a single ""omnibus"" bill, becoming the first bipartisan legislation under Mr Trump's presidency.  Democrats, who are needed to pass the measure, have warned they would not support any bill that included funding for Mr Trump's wall along the US-Mexican border and eliminated cost-sharing reductions.  Meanwhile, Republicans have revived their health care bill after the key conservative group, the House Freedom Caucus, announced it would support a revised version of the measure.  Mr Trump and his party, which controls both chambers of Congress, suffered a huge blow last month when the Freedom Caucus helped derail the Republican health bill.  Republicans have vowed for several years to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's signature Affordable Care Act.  It is unclear if moderate Republicans will back the new revisions.",Friday 28 April 2017,28-Apr-17,Trump 'backs down' in new spending bill,Congress is set to vote on a short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown for one week.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39735900
"Passenger dragged off United Airlines plane wins settlement The Kentucky doctor dragged off a United Airlines flight from Chicago earlier this month has received a financial settlement from the airline. Lawyers for Dr David Dao, 69, say a condition of the payout is that the ""amount remain confidential"". United boss Oscar Munoz ""said he was going to do the right thing and he has"", Dr Dao's lawyers said. Dr Dao was violently removed by airline law enforcement officers after refusing to give up his seat to United staff. Video of the bleeding Vietnamese-American doctor went viral online and sparked international outrage. The airline had asked Dr Dao to leave his seat in order to allow four United staff members to get from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky. He refused, saying he had patients to see the next day. Dr Dao's lawyer, Thomas Demetrio, said his client ""has become the unintended champion for the adoption of changes which will certainly help improve the lives of literally millions of travellers"". Dr Dao suffered concussion, a broken nose, and lost his two front teeth in an experience that his lawyer said was ""more horrifying and harrowing"" than his experiences during the Vietnam War. What the plaintiff's attorneys described as an ""amicable settlement"" comes on the same day that United Airlines announced a shake-up of its booking policy. Passengers will now be offered up to $10,000 (£7,700) for giving up their seats, among other changes that Dr Dao's lawyer said should be ""applauded"". However, aviation experts doubt that many passengers will actually be offered such a large sum. Delta Airlines also increased its maximum payout to $9,950 and Southwest Airlines said it will no longer overbook flights ""as part of our selling process"". ""Every customer deserves to be treated with the highest levels of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect,"" Mr Munoz said in announcing the airline carrier's change in policy.  ""Two weeks ago, we failed to meet that standard and we profoundly apologise."" Three Chicago Department of Aviation officers who pulled Dr Dao off the plane and a supervisor involved in the incident remain on paid leave.

"Terror arrest near Houses of Parliament A man carrying knives near the Houses of Parliament has been wrestled to the ground by armed police and arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences. The man, aged 27, was detained as part of an intelligence-led operation on Parliament Street. A witness described seeing two knives on the ground, one of which he described as a large bread knife. The Metropolitan Police said there were no injuries. The suspect is in custody in a south London police station. A French tourist who saw the arrest said the suspect looked ""very calm"". Another witness said the man was not shouting, or acting aggressively. A police statement said: ""The man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon and on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. Knives have been recovered from him. ""Detectives from the counter-terrorism command are continuing their investigation, and as a result of this arrest there is no immediate known threat."" The incident happened just yards from Downing Street, although Prime Minister Theresa May spent the day campaigning in Derbyshire and Leeds. Mrs May said: ""I think it shows that our police and our intelligence and security services are on the alert, as they always are, looking to keep us safe and secure."" The BBC's home affairs correspondent June Kelly said: ""It's understood that the man was detained as part of an ongoing operation by Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command.  ""Officers working on intelligence moved in on him in Whitehall. He was then searched and arrested."" It's thought the man lives in London and holds a British passport, but was born outside the UK. Addresses linked to him are being searched. Eyewitness Helen Chandler-Wilde described seeing ""knives and a brown backpack lying on the floor"" at the scene at the time of the arrest. She told BBC Radio 5 Live that passers-by remained calm and were ""remarkably not scared at all"". by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This, on the face of it, appears to have been a successful intelligence-led operation by the Metropolitan Police and MI5, the security service.  The suspect arrested today had been under surveillance for some time.  It's not known what his exact intentions were. But the fact that he was arrested with two knives, close to Parliament and the centre of government, has contributed to this case being investigated by SO15, the Met Police's counter-terrorism command.  At this stage it is not thought that any other country's law enforcement agency is involved. The area around Whitehall has been on increased alert since 22 March when Khalid Masood killed five people, including a police officer, in a terrorist attack.  In addition to visible armed officers, a number of armed police officers regularly patrol the streets of the capital with mobile armouries, ready to respond to an attack. by Mario Cacciottolo, BBC News A number of items were left on the ground following the incident in Whitehall. Two police forensics officers, covered in crime scene suits, slowly photographed and picked each one up. Several knives and what looked like paper or tissue were all put into a separate bag or box. When it came to the brown rucksack lying on the floor, the officer opened it up somewhat gingerly.

"Macedonia parliament stormed by protesters in Skopje Protesters stormed into Macedonia's parliament on Thursday after an ethnic Albanian was elected as speaker. A brawl broke out injuring scores of people, including the Social Democrat leader Zoran Zaev, who was left with blood pouring down his face. The protesters, supporters of ex-Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's VMRO party, are demanding new elections.  Politics in the former Yugoslav republic has been deadlocked since an inconclusive election in December. But the crisis goes back further, to a phone-tapping scandal two years ago. Mr Zaev has created a coalition with ethnic Albanian parties, but his attempts to form a government have been blocked by the president.  Macedonian nationalists have been protesting on the streets since Mr Zaev tried to form the coalition. Ethnic Albanians make up around a quarter of the country's population. The people who stormed parliament were angered by the coalition's decision to elect Talat Xhaferi as speaker They fear moves to improve the status of Albanians threaten Macedonian unity. Some of the 200 protesters were masked. Witnesses saw broken glass on the floor and traces of blood in hallways.  Police fired stun grenades to disperse protesters and allow politicians to exit the parliament building. On Friday, the interior ministry said 102 people had been treated in hospital, including 10 MPs and police officers, AFP news agency reported.  A statement from the US Embassy in Macedonia, published on Twitter, said: ""We condemn the violence in the strongest possible terms. ""It is not consistent with democracy and is not an acceptable way to resolve differences."" The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted that he was ""shocked"" by the ""attacks"". ""All parties should respect democratic process and engage in dialogue, not violence,"" he wrote. ""Violence has NO place in Parliament.

"Syria war: Israel Patriot missile downs 'target' over Golan Israel shot down ""a target"" over the Golan Heights, hours after it was accused of a missile strike at a military site near Damascus international airport. Israel deployed its Patriot missile defence system and media reported the target was a drone.  The earlier strike had damaged what Syrian rebels said was an arms depot run by Lebanon's Hezbollah movement. Israel said the explosion was ""consistent"" with its policy. But it stopped short of confirming it was responsible. The Israeli military Twitter account then announced it had intercepted the later ""target"" over the Golan Heights on the border with Syria, without elaborating. The military declined to confirm the target was a drone.  Israel regards Hezbollah, and its key backer Iran, as its biggest threat. It went to war with Hezbollah in 2006 and the group has grown considerably more powerful since then.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that the powerful blast was heard across the capital at dawn on Thursday and that it was believed to have happened near the main road that leads to the airport. Syrian state news agency Sana said several missiles had been fired at a military site south-west of the airport, causing explosions that resulted in some material losses. Pro-government Al-Mayadeen TV cited sources as saying that missiles had been fired by Israeli jets flying inside the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Two senior rebel sources based in Damascus told Reuters news agency that the missiles had hit an ammunition depot in a closed military area that was used by Iran-backed militias operating alongside the Syrian army, led by Hezbollah. Appearing to confirm Israeli involvement, Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Army Radio: ""I can confirm that the incident in Syria corresponds completely with Israel's policy to act to prevent Iran's smuggling of advanced weapons via Syria to Hezbollah in Iran. Naturally, I don't want to elaborate on this."" ""The prime minister has said that whenever we receive intelligence that indicated an intention to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah, we will act."" The Israeli military declined to comment on the reports, however Israel is thought to have bombed arms shipments intended for Hezbollah several times since the Syrian conflict began. In a rare step last month, the Israeli military confirmed that its jets had struck several targets inside Syria in a raid that prompted the Syrian military to fire a number of ground-to-air missiles, one of which was intercepted over Israeli territory. On Wednesday, a high-ranking Israeli military officer briefed reporters that approximately 100 missiles intended for Hezbollah had been destroyed in the raid. 23 April 2017: Alleged Israeli attack on a training camp used by militia in Syria's Golan Heights region, kills three members of the Syrian pro-government National Defence Forces, according to the group.  17 March 2017: The Israeli military says its aircraft attacked several targets in Syria and shot down a Syrian missile.  22 February 2017: Israeli aircraft reportedly bomb several Syrian air bases near Damascus, including a Hezbollah convoy travelling with the Syrian army. 12 January 2017: The Syrian government accuses Israel of firing several rockets on the Mezzeh air base from the Sea of Galilee.  30 November 2016: Israeli aircraft fire missiles on the Syrian town of Saboura, west of Damascus, according to Syrian military sources.  18 January 2015: Six Hezbollah fighters and several Iranian soldiers, including a general, die in suspected Israeli air strikes in Syria's Golan Heights region.  19 December 2015: Suspected Israeli missiles hit Jaramana district of Damascus, killing nine Hezbollah fighters, including leading figure Samir Qantar.",Friday 28 April 2017,28-Apr-17,Israel shoots down 'target' over Golan Heights,The intercept came hours after Israel reportedly launched a missile at a military site near Damascus.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39739787
"France election: Teenagers protest at candidates Macron and Le Pen Teenagers in Rennes and other French cities have held rallies or blocked schools in a protest against both presidential candidates. In a campaign tagged ""We deserve better"", about 1,000 people came out in the western city to chant ""neither Le Pen nor Macron"". Riot police used tear gas to stop them reaching the historic city centre. The far right's Marine Le Pen has spoken in Nice and centrist Emmanuel Macron visited a troubled Paris suburb. Opinion polls taken since the first round on Sunday suggest Mr Macron, candidate of the En Marche (On The Move) movement, will easily beat Ms Le Pen, who has temporarily stood down as leader of the National Front (FN), in the second round on 7 May. However, Ms Le Pen upstaged her rival on Tuesday when she turned up in his northern home town of Amiens just as he was visiting himself. Ms Le Pen found herself under fire again on Thursday as EU sources accused her of defrauding the European Parliament of about €5m (£4m; $5.4m), allegedly paying FN assistants who were not really working for MEPs but were engaged in party work in France.  %  Emmanuel  Macron  %  Marine  Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart.

When a group of about 50 tried to occupy the railway station, police used tear gas and one officer cut off from the rest briefly drew his pistol to protect himself, Le Parisien daily reports (in French). Unrest continued in the city centre, with police bringing in a helicopter to survey the crowd, AFP news agency says. Placards read ""Expel Marine Le Pen, not immigrants"" and ""We don't want Macron or Le Pen"". Other unrest was reported in the western city of Nantes and parts of the capital Paris. Since Mr Macron and Ms le Pen narrowly won the first round on Sunday, some supporters of the losing candidates have advocated a protest vote against both on 7 May. Mr Macron visited the deprived Paris suburb of Sarcelles on Thursday to meet local people in a stadium where he played football briefly with delighted children.  Sarcelles, home to large Muslim and Jewish communities, saw riots in the summer of 2014 in which Jewish-owned businesses and a synagogue were targeted.     Mr Macron accused Ms Le Pen of not being willing to visit ""a district like this"". ""France is not hatred and rejection of others,"" he said.   Speaking later in an interview for the TF1 channel, he said France's biggest challenge was mass employment and it needed a policy ""which allows companies to hire and invest"". He promised, if elected, fundamental reform of labour laws this summer. Elsewhere in the interview, Mr Macron vowed to:  Ms Le Pen gave her first big rally of the second round in the southern city of Nice, which was traumatised by the Bastille Day lorry attack claimed by so-called Islamic State last year.   She accused Mr Macron, a former banker, of being the candidate of the ""oligarch class"" whose idea of France was a space where ""everything can be bought and sold"".   Portraying herself as a patriot to the cheering crowd, she said the election was a ""referendum for or against France"" and she promised to halt ""mass immigration"". ""I will give France back its borders immediately because I choose France,"" she said. Describing Nice as a city ""martyred by Islamist terrorism"", she said she would show no ""weakness in the face of Islamic fundamentalism"". The rally ended with a rendition of the national anthem, La Marseillaise, which was sung twice at Ms Le Pen's request from the stage. ""Forward to victory, my friends!"" she cried. Local FN representative Lionel Tivoli told Reuters news agency earlier that party membership in Nice's Alpes-Maritimes region had jumped from 740 two years ago to 3,500-4,000 now, driven in particular by the attack.

Mr Putin said both wanted to see ""peaceful, constructive dialogue"" between the opposing parties. Relations between North Korea and the US have plunged in recent weeks.

It came after President Donald Trump announced the US was sending a naval carrier group to patrol the Korean peninsula. North Korea, meanwhile, threatened to launch a ""super-mighty pre-emptive strike"" against what it called US aggression. North Korea is also believed to be on the verge of conducting another nuclear bomb test.  Washington fears it could develop a nuclear device small enough to fit on a long-range missile which could reach the US, though some experts say this is some way off.  But if North Korea did decide to launch a missile attack, neighbours South Korea and Japan could be targeted. Mr Abe is keen to ensure the situation does not deteriorate further. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Putin said:  ""In my opinion, and in the opinion of the prime minister, the situation on the Korean peninsula has unfortunately got a lot worse. ""We call on all governments involved in regional matters to refrain from using belligerent rhetoric and to strive for peaceful constructive dialogue.""",Friday 28 April 2017,28-Apr-17,Putin calls for talks over N Korea,"The Russian leader urges the parties involved to ""refrain from using belligerent rhetoric"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39740347

"Tennessee family sues after female janitor charged with raping boy The family of a teenage boy is seeking $4.5m (£3.4m) in damages after a female janitor allegedly raped him at a Tennessee high school.  Jessica Galyon, 29, was arrested in February after she allegedly sexually assaulted a 16-year-old boy during school hours.  The victim's family filed a lawsuit on Monday against the school district and the contractor who employed her. The boy dropped out of school after the alleged incident.  The lawsuit accuses Roane County Schools and Compass One of gross negligence in allowing the alleged rape to occur.  Ms Galyon began talking to the Midway High School student in August, when she allegedly asked for the student's phone number and for him to become her friend on Facebook, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported. She then began sending ""flirtatious and sexual messages"" to the teenager, who rebuffed her advances, according to the lawsuit.  In September Ms Galyon invited the boy to a hotel room to have sex, but he rejected the offer and said he did not want ""any further contact"", the lawsuit said.  He later confronted her about her behaviour and she allegedly took him into a room and raped him during school hours.  ""This was the first ever sexual encounter of any kind that (the boy) had ever had in his life,"" the lawsuit said.  Ms Galyon's alleged harassment of the teenager was reportedly known around school.

"'Overly obese' body sparks Ohio funeral home fire A crematorium in Ohio caught fire while burning the remains of an ""overly obese"" body, according to the owner. Don Catchen said the corpse caused flames to engulf one of his units in the city of Cincinnati. The fat in the body burned at a higher temperature, prompting the blaze, said the city fire chief. The blog Confessions of a Funeral Director describes a blaze resulting from the cremation of a morbidly obese person as a ""grease fire"". No other parts of the building were damaged, Mr Catchen said.  The fire was contained to the garage where the crematory unit is located, he told BBC News.  The fire began at 21:40 (01:40 GMT) on Wednesday and took about two hours to put out, Mr Catchen told local news outlet WCPO.  ""My operator was in the process of cremating remains and [the body] was overly obese and apparently it got a little hotter than the unit is supposed to get,"" Mr Catchen added. ""One of the cremation containers that we had close got caught on fire and that's what burnt."" No other bodies were damaged in the fire, he said.  ""We believe there were some combustible storage boxes that were too close to the ovens,"" said Cincinnati Fire Chief Michael Washington. Mr Catchen added the fireproof unit is made of concrete block with a steel roof, but also has a rubberised roof.  A similar blaze at a Virginia facility in October 2014 occurred during the cremation of a 500lb (226kg) body.

"Fox host Watters takes sudden leave after Ivanka remark backlash Fox News presenter Jesse Watters has announced he is taking a holiday, after appearing to make a sexually suggestive remark about Ivanka Trump. He said, with a grin, that he ""really liked how she was speaking into the microphone"" in her Berlin appearance. The next day he denied it was sexual, saying he was instead complimenting her voice which is ""like a jazz radio DJ"". He is regarded as a protege of presenter Bill O'Reilly, recently fired by Fox over sexual harassment claims. A few hours after Mr Watters' denial, he made the surprise announcement on-air that he was taking a previously unannounced holiday. Following a baseball clip, he told the Fox panellists: ""Also, I'm going to be taking a vacation with my family, so I'm not going to be here tomorrow.""  The show moved on to a segment about a sloth born at the Memphis zoo. ""I'll be back on Monday, so don't miss me too much,"" he added. His Saturday show, Watters' World, will be covered by a colleague. He made his controversial Ivanka remarks on the show The Five, which was moved to a primetime time slot after Fox announced Mr O'Reilly's departure last week. ""It's funny, the left says they really respect women, and then when given an opportunity to respect a woman like that, they boo and hiss,"" he said about audience members at the female entrepreneurship discussion in Berlin.  ""So I don't really get what's going on here, but I really liked how she was speaking into that microphone,"" he said, looking directly into the camera. Mr Watters has drawn controversy for segments about New York City's homeless population and the city's Chinatown district.  Last month he interviewed President Donald Trump while aboard Air Force One, becoming one of only 45 people that the president follows on Twitter. The sudden announcement comes as the network scrambles to recover from multiple allegations of sexual harassment that have led to the resignations of Mr O'Reilly and Fox News founder and CEO Roger Ailes. On Tuesday, long-time Fox reporter Kelly Wright joined a lawsuit with 12 other current and former employees alleging that executives knew about sexual and racial discrimination, but did nothing to stop it. Mr Wright, who has worked at Fox since 2003 accused the network of ""plantation-style management,"" saying that co-president Bill Shine obsessively focused on Mr Wright's race, which is African-American. He also said that Mr O'Reilly refused to show a series on his programme about the racial divide in Ferguson, Missouri, because it showed ""blacks in too positive a light"". Fox News has said it ""vehemently denies the race discrimination"" allegations.

"Two Americans killed in IS Afghan raid Two Americans were killed and a third was wounded in a raid in Afghanistan against Islamic State group militants, the Pentagon has confirmed. The military personnel died in combat in Nangarhar province, said Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis. Earlier this month American Army Staff Sgt Mark De Alencar, 37, was killed in the same province. It comes only days after US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited the country. The American soldiers were conducting an operation against IS Khorasan, an affiliate of the core Middle Eastern group. The operation was conducted in partnership with the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces, the Pentagon said. ""The fight against ISIS-K is important for the world, but sadly, it is not without sacrifice,"" said General John Nicholson, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan. ""On behalf of all US forces and our coalition partners, I offer our deepest sympathies to the families, friends, and fellow service members of our fallen comrades,"" he continued. Next of kin have been notified, but their names are being temporarily withheld from the media, the Defence Department said. The operation took place near the district of Achin, near to where the US recently dropped ""the mother of all bombs"", the largest non-nuclear weapon in the US arsenal. The Mother of All Bombs: How badly did it hurt IS in Afghanistan? A spokesman for the Nangarhar governor told Reuters that about 40 IS fighters were killed in the raid, and another 13 were captured alive. Estimates for how many IS fighters are in Afghanistan vary.  US officials believe about 700 fighters occupy the Nangarhar and neighbouring Kunar province.

"North Korea crisis: North in another 'failed' missile launch North Korea has test-fired another ballistic missile, South Korean and US military officials say. The missile exploded shortly after take-off, they said - the second failed launch in the past fortnight. US President Donald Trump accused North Korea of showing ""disrespect"" towards China and its president. The missile was fired from a site in South Pyeongan province, north of Pyongyang, in the early hours of Saturday local time, South Korea said. It came just hours after the United Nations Security Council discussed North Korea's missile programme. Mr Trump tweeted: ""North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!"" Mr Trump recently hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and praised him for ""trying very hard"" on North Korea. Tensions in the region have increased lately, with both North and South Korea conducting military exercises. North Korea is believed to be continuing efforts to miniaturise nuclear warheads and fit them on long-range missiles capable of reaching the US. It is not known what kind of missile was unsuccessfully launched on Saturday, however, one official told Reuters it was probably a medium-range missile known as a KN-17. The land-based, anti-ship ballistic missile has already had two failures, but its message is that US, South Korean and Japanese ships should beware. Meanwhile, an American aircraft carrier - the USS Carl Vinson - has reportedly arrived in the region after it was sent to the Korean peninsula as part of Mr Trump's ""armada"". The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JSC) said in a statement that the ""unidentified missile"" was fired ""from a site in the vicinity of Bukchang in Pyeongannam-do (South Pyeongan Province)"" early on Saturday. Commander Dave Benham, a spokesman for US Pacific Command, also said the launch had occurred near the Bukchang airfield. He added that the missile did not leave North Korean territory. After Saturday's failed launch, the Japanese government condemned the test and said it had lodged a strong protest with North Korea through its diplomatic channels. North Korea has had two failed missile launches this month - but that does not mean they will always fail, an expert has said. Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, told the BBC this was to be expected when testing a new missile as there was such a variety of things which could go wrong. ""Every time you have a new missile there are going to be growing pains,"" he said. ""There is nothing unusual if it is new missiles. ""It will fail until it doesn't. ""In fact, the [American] rocket which put Alan Shepard [the first US man] in space was known as 'Old Reliable', but it failed nine out of 10 of its first tests.""  Data collected by his institute also suggested North Korea's old missiles ""work just fine"", he added. Mr Lewis also rejected suggestions a US cyber attack might have been behind the recent failures, pointing to successful launches in Iran. ""If they are hacking the North Koreans, they would be hacking the Iranians,"" he noted. The US has threatened to use military force in North Korea if necessary. On Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused UN Security Council members of not fully enforcing existing sanctions against the North, and called on China in particular to use its trade links as influence. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the key to solving the problem did not lie with his country.

"German airlines drop safety rule prompted by Germanwings crash German airlines are dropping safety rules brought in after the 2015 Germanwings plane crash which require two people in the cockpit at all times. Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people by crashing the plane - apparently on purpose - after the plane's captain left to use the toilet. Airlines now say the two-person rule has no safety benefits. Eurowings, which merged with the Germanwings brand, is one of the airlines now dropping the requirement. The German airline association BDL announced the change, which will come into effect by 1 June, on its website. It said its airlines will be re-introducing their original cockpit safety procedures. The European Aviation Safety Agency, which was behind the original rule change, relaxed the requirements last year to allow individual airlines to evaluate their own safety needs. BDL said that its airlines had ""independently"" reviewed the rules and decided that the two-person rule had no safety benefits - and could actually be more dangerous. The group said the changes caused ""more frequent and predictable"" opening of the cockpit door and expanded the number of people with access to the cockpit. It also said that the risk of a similar incident to the Germanwings crash was extremely low, and the risk of criminal or terrorist activity was much higher. Lufthansa, the country's biggest airline, is one of the groups removing the requirement. Its airlines include Austrian Airlines, Swiss Airlines, and Eurowings - which was merged with Germanwings in 2015, a process which had begun before the company's high-profile crash. However, other airlines in Europe have said they will be maintaining the two-person rule.  The investigation into the 2015 Germanwings crash found that co-pilot Lubitz locked the plane's captain out of the cockpit when he left to use the toilet, before putting the plane into a dive. It struck the mountains at 700km/h (430mph) an hour, instantly killing everyone on board. Investigators later discovered he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. He believed he was losing his sight - although he was not - and had been taking psychotropic medication which made him unfit to fly. Since the Germanwings crash, additional screening measures for mental health have been introduced for pilots.",Saturday 29 April 2017,29-Apr-17,German airlines drop cockpit safety rule,The carriers scrap the two-person policy brought in after the 2015 Germanwings crash.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39749803
"Friendly fire inquiry after US soldiers die battling IS Two US Army Rangers killed in Afghanistan this week may have been hit by friendly fire, the Pentagon says. The soldiers were fatally wounded during a firefight on Wednesday night with the Islamic State (IS) group in eastern Afghanistan, US officials said. The two were identified on Friday as Sgt Joshua Rodgers, 22, and Sgt Cameron Thomas, 23, who were both on their third deployment to Afghanistan. A bullet grazed a third Ranger but he was expected to make a full recovery. US Forces in Afghanistan said in a statement: ""USFOR-A is investigating the possibility that the two Rangers were accidentally killed by friendly fire during the more than three-hour fight.  ""We have informed both of their families of this possibility and we have appointed a team to investigate the soldiers' deaths."" Sgt Rodgers, of Bloomington, Illinois, was a Ranger team leader. Sgt Thomas, of Kettering, Ohio, was an anti-armour specialist.  Both were assigned to the 75th Ranger Regiment in Fort Benning, Georgia. They were on a mission with Afghan security forces when they came under attack in remote Nangarhar province, near the border with Pakistan. The operation took place in the Mamand Valley, where the US earlier this month dropped the largest non-nuclear munition ever used - known as the mother of all bombs - to destroy an IS tunnel network. The Mother of All Bombs: How badly did it hurt IS in Afghanistan? According to the Pentagon, the target of the raid was Abdul Hasib, leader of ""ISIS-K"", as the US military calls the militant group's Afghan affiliate. The operation began at about 22:30 (18:00 GMT) local time on Wednesday, the US defence department said. Two platoons of Army Rangers along with the same number of Afghan forces were dropped off by helicopter near the IS base. ""Within a few minutes of landing, our combined force came under intense fire from multiple directions and well-prepared fighting positions,"" said the Pentagon.  ""Nevertheless, our forces successfully closed on the enemy, killed several high-level ISIS-K leaders and upwards of 35 fighters.  ""If confirmed, the death of the Emir and his associates will significantly degrade ISIS-K operations in Afghanistan and help reach our goal of destroying them in 2017."" The fighting was at ""close-quarters from multiple compounds"" and US air strikes were carried out. The Pentagon said it had heard no indication of civilian casualties, praising the actions of the US and Afghan forces as ""exemplary"". ""In the most difficult terrain and under complex circumstances, they were able to accomplish their mission while protecting the women and children in the compound,"" said the statement.

"Trump executive order aims to allow Arctic drilling Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing restrictions on oil drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic in order to ""unleash American energy"". The US president said it would create ""thousands and thousands"" of jobs, despite a downturn in the oil market. It could undo a ban put in place by Barack Obama in order to protect swathes of the ocean from development. But Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the decision was better than being held hostage by ""foreign entities"". Getting rid of Mr Obama's environmental protections was one of Mr Trump's promises to voters while on the campaign trail. As he signed the order, called the America-First Offshore Energy Strategy, Mr Trump said:  ""Our country's blessed with incredible natural resources, including abundant offshore oil and natural gas reserves, but the federal government has kept 94% of these offshore areas closed for exploration and production. ""This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth."" The order instructs the US Department of Interior to come up with a new development plan for all federal waters off US coasts. It is debatable how much income might be generated by a reversal of Mr Obama's order. Worldwide prices for oil have dropped in recent years, with a review by news agency Reuters finding the amount of money oil companies spent in the central Gulf of Mexico's annual lease sale dropped by more than 75% between 2012 and 2017.  Meanwhile, environmental groups have already said they will challenge Mr Trump. David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, a non-profit conservation group, said: ""The Trump administration's hasty move today toward expanding offshore oil drilling ... defies market realities and is as reckless as it is unnecessary.""

"US growth rate hits three-year low The US economy slowed dramatically in the first three months of the year, according to official data. GDP expanded at an annual rate of 0.7% in the first quarter - the slowest rate since the first quarter of 2014. It will be unwelcome news for President Donald Trump who, during his election campaign, made a pledge to raise growth to 4%. In a bid to fulfil that promise, on Wednesday the White House proposed slashing the rate of corporation tax. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin unveiled President Trump's tax blueprint, which aims to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15%. The plan also proposed an incentive for companies to bring back money held overseas and a cut in tax rate for individuals, although the plans were light on detail. What will Trump's tax plan actually do? Trump seeks tax windfall for business The Trump administration may be reassured by the trend in recent years for growth figures to be depressed in the first quarter, but then pick up later in the year. ""US GDP figures are typically weaker in the first quarter, so this reading is in line with the seasonal trend,"" said Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. ""We haven't yet had the expected fiscal stimulus from Trump, the effects of which may not be seen until the end of this year or the start of 2018."" The annualised first quarter growth rate of 0.7% was less than the 1% analysts had been expecting, and a slowdown from the 2.1% growth rate seen in the final quarter of last year The slowdown was down to stagnant consumer spending, economists said. ""Household spending was held down by a drop back in motor vehicle sales from a near-record high at the end of last year and the unseasonably warm winter weather, which depressed utilities spending,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. But he thinks consumer spending will ""rebound"" as personal income showed healthy growth and data suggests that consumer confidence remains high. Close Brothers' Ms Curtin also pointed out that other data suggested strength in the US economy . ""While investors might be disappointed with the reading, it has been a steady start to the year with inflation looking benign, a resilient jobs market and positive PMI [purchasing managers'] data."" Just two days ago, as they released President Trump's proposals for large tax cuts, his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and his National Economic Director, Gary Cohn, were boasting that an annual GDP growth rate of 3% and above was possible. Indeed their tax plan relies on higher growth to make up for the lost revenue of lower tax rates. And the president himself likes to talk about 4% growth! Today's data shows how bold those claims are. The fact is the US economy has been in steady-but-slow growth mode for years. While it's true that the first three months of a year are usually particularly weak, and that growth will likely pick up in the coming months, it's also the case that a 3% annual growth rate hasn't been consistently delivered since the 1990s. So whatever it is that would boost growth - be it tax cuts or large government spending - is likely to require far-reaching legislation from Congress. Based on the first 100 days, there are few signs that the Trump administration can secure that.",Saturday 29 April 2017,29-Apr-17,US growth rate hits three-year low,"Figures mark a sombre start to the presidency of Donald Trump, whose tax plans rely on higher growth.",http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39748165
"Breast surgeon Ian Paterson needlessly harmed patients A breast surgeon who ""played God"" and carried out ""completely unnecessary"" operations has been convicted of intentionally wounding patients. Ian Paterson, 59, carried out ""extensive, life-changing operations for no medically-justifiable reason"". His motives were ""obscure"" but may have included a desire to ""earn extra money"", Nottingham Crown Court heard. Paterson was found guilty of 17 counts of wounding with intent, relating to nine women and one man. Jurors also convicted him of three further wounding charges. Paterson, of Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was granted bail and is due to be sentenced in May. The trial heard Paterson, who treated thousands of patients during his career, exaggerated or invented cancer risks and claimed payments for more expensive procedures in some cases. Surgeon 'played God' with women's bodies Paterson 'psychopathic like Shipman' The seven-week trial heard the accounts from 10 victims - representing a sample of those Paterson treated - operated on between 1997 and 2011 at the privately-run Little Aston and Parkway hospitals in the West Midlands.  Jurors were not told Paterson carried out hundreds of unnecessary operations on NHS patients, with a hospital trust paying out £17.8m in damages and legal costs. During proceedings, former patients gave moving testimony about their treatment at Paterson's hands. One told the jury: ""That person has ruined my life."" Others told how Paterson misled them into thinking they were seriously ill, leading them to agree to surgery. One said she was called a ""ticking time bomb"" by the surgeon and he convinced another she had cancer when she was only at risk of developing it. Debbie Douglas, a former patient who attended court, but did not give evidence, said after Paterson was convicted: ""I thought I had the best of consultants. All these years down the line, I feel I've been betrayed.  ""I feel like I've been mutilated. I thought my scars were a badge of honour. Now I find he has mutilated me and I have been through all of this for nothing.  ""Thank God those brave people who spoke up in court have got the right verdict."" Carole Johnson, who went under Paterson's knife six times in seven years, said: ""Paterson tried every tactic in the book to avoid accountability for his disgusting crimes. ""Mr Paterson charmed and manipulated his patients into trusting him. I for one trusted him with my life. ""To realise that I was betrayed makes me question my own judgment and I feel like I cannot trust any doctor."" It wasn't just Ian Paterson's private work that was a cause for concern.  He was also employed by the NHS at the Heart of England Trust, based in and around Birmingham.  His job here did not form part of the criminal case but there are serious questions about his work. In 2011 it emerged he had been performing an unorthodox and unregulated procedure known as a cleavage-sparing mastectomy.  By definition, a mastectomy removes the whole breast, but this procedure left some tissue behind, putting women at risk of the cancer returning.  Despite repeatedly being asked to stop by managers, Ian Paterson continued to use the technique for several years.  The Heart of England Trust has now paid out nearly £18 million in damages and legal costs to hundreds of his former patients. Health worker John Ingram, who was wounded with intent, earlier told the trial how he underwent a double mastectomy at Paterson's hands despite his ""phobia"" of surgery and he still lived with near-constant pain 10 years on. Jurors also earlier heard how victim Rosemary Platt, herself a GP, had an ""unnecessary"" operation to remove a breast after being told she had cancer that could turn aggressive at any time. Dr Platt, now retired, said Paterson told her he would recommend the same procedure to his wife if in the same position. Det Insp Caroline Marsh of West Midlands Police said: ""There is lots of speculation as to why he has done what he has done. ""Some of his victims said he wanted to play God with their lives or he got some perverse satisfaction from these procedures. We will probably never know."" Police said it is believed Paterson may also have been driven by financial gain, so he could claim payment for carrying out each procedure to fund his extravagant lifestyle. As a result of his work, he owned a luxury home in Birmingham's Edgbaston area, numerous properties in Cardiff and Manchester and a holiday home in the U.S. The jury of six men and five women were warned against researching the case, and were not told hundreds of Paterson's patients were recalled in 2012 over concerns about his work. He performed what he called ""cleavage-sparing"" mastectomies on many of his patients, leaving breast tissue behind to achieve a better cosmetic effect.  By doing so, he left them in great danger of developing secondary cancer, jurors heard. The Scottish-born surgeon, of Castle Mill Lane, Ashley, was suspended by the General Medical Council (GMC) after his arrest. An independent report in 2013, by lawyer Sir Ian Kennedy, found concerns about Paterson dated back to 2003 but were not dealt with for four years. He said bosses at the Heart of England NHS Trust were told of concerns but ""brushed them under the carpet"". ""It is a story of clinicians going along with what they knew to be poor performance, "" Sir Ian said. ""It is a story of weak and indecisive leadership from senior managers. It is a story of secrecy and containment."" In total, Paterson operated on 4,424 people, although he treated thousands more privately. The Royal College of Surgeons said he was ""often working in isolation"", instead of within a team, and used ""techniques that would be unrecognised to surgeons"". ""This was an individual who abused the trust put in him by patients and played God with their lives.  ""In modern practice, patients are fully informed of the care options open to them, so they can decide what form of care is best for them.  ""In circumstances such as these, decisions should not be decided by the single personal opinion of a doctor."" Spire Healthcare, which runs the hospitals at Little Aston and Parkway, said: ""What Mr Paterson did in our hospitals, in other private hospitals and in the NHS, absolutely should not have happened and today justice has been done. ""We would like to reiterate how truly sorry we are for the distress experienced by any patients affected by this case."" Heart of England NHS Trust said: ""We welcome the verdict and appreciate the distress caused to Ian Paterson's patients and families."" In October, 350 private patients who had unnecessary operations will seek compensation at the High Court, Linda Millband from Thompsons Solicitors said. Pamela Jain, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""Paterson breached the trust of his victims and we pay tribute to them for coming forward to give their evidence.""",Saturday 29 April 2017,29-Apr-17,'God complex' breast surgeon guilty,"Ian Paterson conducted ""extensive, life-changing operations for no medically-justifiable reason"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-39748246
"Ilie Nastase: Romania's Fed Cup captain to quit game if punished by ITF   
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Ilie Nastase will quit tennis if he is banned over derogatory comments he made about Serena Williams' unborn child.  Williams accused Nastase of racism after he was overheard asking if the child would be ""chocolate with milk"". Nastase apologised in a Facebook post on Friday, but later told BBC Sport: ""For me it's not racial. Somebody in England thinks it is."" The Romania captain also insulted Johanna Konta during a recent Fed Cup tie, and called a journalist ""stupid"".   ""English people considered it was racist and everybody picked it up like that,"" he said of his remarks about Williams. ""Romanians don't think it was a racial word. The only person who can get upset maybe is Serena, but not you people in England. Why does everybody else get upset? I don't understand. Whatever.""  The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has launched an investigation into those remarks, and into his outburst that left Britain's Konta in tears on Saturday.  WARNING: Some people may find the language below offensive After Konta and Britain's captain Anne Keothavong had complained of calling-out from the crowd in the World Group II play-off tie in Constanta, Nastase was involved in a discussion with officials in which he used foul and abusive language. He then called both Konta and Keothavong ""a bitch"" multiple times, as well as swearing at them. Before play had even started, Nastase insulted a British journalist over their reporting of his comments about world number one Wiliams, calling the Press Association's tennis correspondent ""stupid"". He also put his arm tightly around Keothavong and asked for her room number, in earshot of the watching media. On Friday in an interview with the BBC, he justified his behaviour by claiming he abused Konta and Keothavong as a member of the crowd - that he was no longer acting as captain, having been sent off. ""Let's start with the umpire because I asked what's his problem and he said to me: 'If you don't sit down, I'm going to throw you out of the game,'"" Nastase said.  ""I sit in the front row and the guy came and said: 'You have to leave the stadium.' Then I start to scream at Konta and the other girl. That's what I did. ""I was not on the court, I have to remind you that. I was thrown out of the game. I said that from the crowd. I wasn't on the court, there is a difference. I'm not anymore the coach of the team. ""I was upset when they throw me out of the court. Then when he said to leave the stadium also then I was upset because the girls they said they didn't want me in the stands anymore. So then I scream at her and the coach."" When asked whether he regretted his behaviour, Nastase replied: ""Of course but just understand, I was upset. Of course I would not say that if I was not upset."" Nastase was suspended by the International Tennis Federation on Sunday, pending further investigation into ""a breach of the Fed Cup welfare policy"". The ITF added that the provisional suspension meant he ""may not participate in the Fed Cup in any capacity with immediate effect"". ""If I am not allowed to go and sit in that chair, I'm not going to go. I've got other things,"" Nastase said of his future in the sport.  ""I've a lot of businesses. I just said the same to the [Romanian] federation because the girls, they want me in the chair. ""I'm 71 years old. I was number one in the world - I want to see how many number ones go to watch a girls' match. I want to see that person. I don't get money, I don't get anything.  ""How many players would do that? And they want to suspend me."" On Sunday, former US Open finalist Pam Shriver claimed Nastase - a former world number one - also made inappropriate comments to her when she was a teenage star of the women's tour. Shriver, now 54, said Nastase repeatedly asked her if she was a virgin. ""Whenever I saw him at any tournament he would ask me the same question,"" she told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek. ""This man has not been respectful of women for a long, long time."" When asked about Shriver's remarks on Friday, Nastase said: ""You're going to go back again another 20, 25 years ago?  ""I was so good in England that I have a statute at Madame Tussauds. Are they going to destroy it and throw it out?  ""Because of this situation are you going to wipe everything? I mean it's ridiculous what you think. Are you going to judge me what happened today with what happened years ago? ""People can like me, people can hate me.

"Willesden shooting: Police foil 'active terror plot' Police say they have foiled an active terror plot after a woman was shot during a raid on a house in Willesden, north-west London. The 21-year-old woman was one of the subjects of the investigation and is in a serious but stable condition.  A raid also took place in Kent, with six people arrested in total. Officers say the operation was not connected to an arrest near Parliament on Thursday, when a man was detained on suspicion of terror offences. The house in Harlesden Road, Willesden, which was raided on Thursday evening, had been under observation by police. Those arrested included a 16-year-old boy, a man and woman, both aged 20 and another man and woman both aged 28. A 43-year-old woman was also arrested in Kent.  All of them were detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorist acts. The woman who was shot is under police guard in hospital but has not been arrested ""due to her condition"",  Alex Paton, 50, who lives in Harlesden Road, said he saw a woman ""getting all cuffed up and put in a white suit"". He described seeing ""coppers and masked men with guns"". Another resident said she had heard the ""bang, bang, bang"" of shots. A neighbour of the raided property suggested the shot woman had suffered injuries to her left arm and stomach.  He said the family who lived there were from Somalia. Ruth Haile, who lives in the road, said she heard shots and the woman on the ground shouting: ""Don't touch me, my body, don't touch my dress."" It is believed to be the first time a woman has been shot by police in 10 years. The last time was in 2007 when Ann Sanderson was fatally shot in Kent. Police said searches had taken place at ""linked addresses"", as well as where the arrests took place. Neil Basu, deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, said: ""Due to these arrests that have been made yesterday, in both cases I believe that we have contained the threats that they pose."" By home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani The intelligence convinced Scotland Yard they needed to go in fast and hard to carry out arrests. That means they feared there was some kind of threat that needed to be contained - a threat that required a large team of the most highly-trained available officers. They fired CS gas canisters into the building, smashing holes in the top front window. The 21-year-old woman who was shot is not one of those under arrest - but has been described by police as one of the ""subjects"" - security services speak for someone at the heart of an operation.

"Executed Arkansas man 'convulsed and groaned' Lawyers for a US death row inmate are calling for an inquiry after witnesses said he convulsed and groaned as he was being executed. Kenneth Williams was the fourth inmate put to death by the state of Arkansas in the past eight days after a dozen years without a single execution. His attorneys said witness descriptions of the lethal injection procedure were ""horrifying"". The United Nations on Friday condemned Arkansas' execution schedule. ""I see no reason for any investigation other than the routine review that is done after every execution,"" Governor Asa Hutchinson responded during a Friday press conference. The state had initially planned to put to death eight men in a span of 11 days, but courts issued reprieves in half those cases. The compressed schedule was because the state's stock of one lethal injection drug, the sedative midazolam, was due to expire at the end of this month, said officials. Journalists who saw Thursday night's execution said Williams' body jerked about 15 times in quick succession three minutes after he received the first of three injections. His chest was said to press against the leather straps binding him to the gurney. The Americans volunteering to watch executions During a consciousness check, Williams groaned before falling still after seven minutes. He was pronounced dead - 13 minutes after the procedure began - at 23:05 (04:05 GMT Friday). His final words were: ""I humbly extend my apologies to those families I have senselessly wronged.""  Governor Hutchinson's spokesman dismissed the prisoner's movements as ""an involuntary muscular reaction"", to be expected with midazolam. But Shawn Nolan, a lawyer for Williams, said it had been ""a problematic execution"" and accused the governor's spokesman of ""trying to whitewash the reality of what happened"". ""Press reports state that within three minutes into the execution, our client began coughing, convulsing, jerking and lurching with sound that was audible even with the microphone turned off,"" he added. He said the legal team had earlier pleaded with the state to ""avoid torturing our client to death"". But Republican state senator Trent Garner, who witnessed the execution, tweeted that Williams did not ""seem in pain"".  ""It was not cruel, unusual, botched or torture,"" he added.  The United Nations' human rights office said it was ""deeply troubled"" that Arkansas had executed four men in eight days after a 12-year moratorium on the death penalty. Spokeswoman Liz Throssell told reporters in Geneva that ""rushing executions"" can violate prisoners' rights by denying them the opportunity to seek clemency. ""Our concern is really the fact that these executions were scheduled because of the expiration date of the drug, and you are absolutely right that adds to the arbitrariness and cruelty of the whole process,"" said Ms Throssell, in response to a reporter's question. The European Union also condemned the execution as ""an unacceptable denial of human rights"".  Williams was initially spared the death penalty when he was sentenced to life in prison for the 1998 murder of 19-year-old cheerleader Dominique Hurd.  After a month in the penitentiary, he escaped in October 1999 by hiding in a barrel used to carry kitchen refuse. Not far from the prison, he encountered Cecil Boren, 57, on his farm. He killed Mr Boren, shooting him multiple times, and stole his Ford F-150 pick-up truck. Williams drove north to Missouri, where he led police on a chase that caused the high-speed death of 24-year-old delivery driver Michael Greenwood. After being jailed, Williams became an ordained Protestant minister, and wrote his autobiography as well as a book warning against gang life.",Saturday 29 April 2017,29-Apr-17,Executed US man 'convulsed and groaned',"The United Nations condemns the ""cruelty"" of Arkansas' execution timetable.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39751283

"Michelle Obama: 'I won't run for office' for my children Former First Lady Michelle Obama appeared to rule out running for elected office during her first public remarks since leaving the White House. The Q&A at an architecture convention in Orlando came days after her husband made his first public comments as ex-president at a Chicago university. Mrs Obama, who left office with a 68% approval rating (10% more than her husband) said ""politics is tough."" ""It's all well and good until you start running, and then the knives come out."" It's hard on a family, she said. ""I wouldn't ask my children to do this again because when you run for higher office, it's not just you. It's your whole family."" But ""public service will always be in our blood"", she added.  Although Mrs Obama had played down her political ambitions before, while first lady, this is the first time she has done so since the election campaign, when she was widely viewed as the most effective weapon in the Democratic armoury. She did not openly discuss President Donald Trump by name during the 45-minute event, but she did make mention of ""the new president"" who marks his 100 days in office on Saturday. ""So far, so good,"" said Mrs Obama when asked about her own family's last 100 days, which included a yacht holiday near Tahiti. She described how her dogs become confused by the sound of a doorbell, which is not a sound you hear at the White House. And now her two daughters can open their windows. She also described fighting back tears when leaving the place where she had lived the longest in her entire life, saying: ""I didn't want to have tears in my eyes because people would swear I was crying because of the new president."" Until this week, the Obamas had kept a low profile since the election, but they are each writing separate memoirs in a book deal worth $40m. Mr Obama has drawn criticism from fellow Democrats over a $400,000 (£309,000) upcoming speaking engagement to a Wall Street investment firm. Progressive senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seen as a possible 2020 presidential candidate, said she was ""troubled"" by Mr Obama's decision.

"Pope Francis visits bombed Coptic church during Egypt visit Pope Francis, on a trip to Egypt, has visited a church where 29 people died in a suicide bombing in December. He attended a service at St Peter and St Paul church in the capital Cairo with Coptic Christian leader Pope Tawadros II. The Pope's visit comes at a time when Egypt's Copts are facing an increased threat from extremist groups. Just three weeks ago, suicide bombers struck two other Coptic churches, killing a further 45 people. Pope Francis had earlier urged an end to the funding of groups that promote violence, an act which could not be committed in the name of God, he said. During a speech at al-Azhar University, a key centre of Sunni Islamic learning, which aimed to improving Christian-Muslim dialogue, the pontiff said religious leaders were ""duty-bound"" to unmask such violence. He also condemned the ""rise of demagogic forms of populism"", adding it was essential"" to ""block the flow of money and weapons"" bound for those who promote violence ""which purports to be carried out in the name of the sacred"". The recent rise of populism, he said, was detrimental to worldwide peace and stability.  ""It is disconcerting to note that, as the concrete realities of people's lives are increasingly ignored in favour of obscure machinations, demagogic forms of populism are on the rise,"" the pontiff said.  Before the 27-hour visit - the first papal trip to Cairo in 20 years - he said he was travelling as a ""messenger of peace"". The visit came as the Egyptian branch of so-called Islamic State (IS) put Christians under increased threat, describing them as its ""favourite prey"". Coptic Christians - who make up 10% of the country's mainly Muslim population - have been particularly targeted. The majority of the Copts are Orthodox, with less than 150,000 of them Catholic. IS said it was behind the Palm Sunday bombings, as well as the St Peter and St Paul church attack. Hundreds of Egyptian Christians fled northern Sinai earlier this year in the wake of at least seven killings by suspected Islamist militants. The 80-year-old Pope - leader of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics - is in Egypt as a guest of Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of the 1,000-year-old seat of Islamic learning, al-Azhar. The conference on Friday forms part of efforts to improve relations after Egyptian Muslim leaders cut ties over comments made by Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict.  In a message ahead of the trip, Francis said he wanted the visit to be ""a witness of my affection, comfort and encouragement for all the Christians of the Middle East"" and ""a message of brotherhood and reconciliation with all the children of Abraham, particularly the Muslim world"". A three-month state of emergency is in place in the wake of the Palm Sunday bombings, and security has been boosted around churches. But many Copts say the government should have done more to protect them, and say they are also under pressure from sectarian tensions and long-standing discrimination.

"DR Congo: UN peacekeepers face fresh sexual abuse claims A UN peacekeeper in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been suspended over allegations that he fathered a child with an underage girl. Under Congolese law, anyone under 18 is considered a minor. The Romanian military observer is among five peacekeepers accused of acts of sexual abuse and exploitation in the first three months of 2017, a senior UN official told the BBC. UN peacekeeping missions have been hit by a raft of child sex abuse scandals. The underage girl involved in the first case has been put under the care of the UN children's agency Unicef, Adama Ndao, head of the conduct and discipline team for the UN peacekeeping mission in the country (Monusco) told the BBC.  All the other cases involve adults. Two of the complaints come from women who are demanding paternal recognition from the peacekeepers they had sex with, Ms Ndao added. She said that one of the women has already had her baby, while the other is still pregnant. Two South African soldiers and two non-military Monusco officials, from Burundi and Niger, are among the accused.  All have been suspended pending the outcome of investigations. Other complaints about UN peacekeepers which have been received and are under consideration, implicate police officers and soldiers from Senegal, Uruguay and South Africa, Monusco spokesman Charles Bambara said on Wednesday.  UN and French forces faced multiple allegations of child rape in the Central African Republic, a scandal which was compounded by allegations of a high-level cover-up.

"Brexit: EU demands 'serious UK response' on citizens' rights  European Council President Donald Tusk has called on the UK to come up with a ""serious response"" on what will happen to EU citizens in Britain after Brexit.

The rights of EU citizens to live, work and study in the UK is one of three topics they want dealt with in the first phase of Brexit talks. Negotiations will start after the UK election on 8 June. Mr Tusk put citizens' rights centre stage at a news conference after EU leaders - minus UK PM Theresa May - nodded through the guidelines in a matter of minutes.

""But I would like to state very clearly that we need real guarantees for our people to live, work and study in the UK. ""The same goes for the Brits,"" living on the European continent, he continued. UK citizens living in EU countries and non-UK EU citizens living in Britain are estimated at 4.5 million. Reality check: Key points explained The EU's negotiating guidelines, first proposed by Mr Tusk in March, list citizens' residency rights, settling Britain's financial commitments to the EU and avoiding a ""hard"" border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland as the three top issues needing agreement in what are termed ""separation talks"".  Only once ""sufficient progress"" is made on these topics can talks touch on the UK's future relationship, including any trade deal, with the EU.  The UK government, however, has pushed for parallel negotiations on trade.  Speaking after the summit, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker again stressed that separation talks could not run in parallel with talks on a future trade deal with the UK, backing the line taken by German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she arrived in Brussels.  EU officials said leaders burst into applause as the negotiating stance was waved through at the summit. EU leaders and officials were keen to stress the EU's unified position on Brexit. Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said: ""We are ready... we are together.""  Expats, exports, security: What's worrying the EU about Brexit? Brexit: All you need to know The people who will negotiate Brexit Brexit - special report The fact that the guidelines approved today haven't changed all that much in the past month shows that the EU's claim to have a unified position on Brexit is more than skin deep.  The other 27 countries do see a common purpose in sticking together; and if anything the main changes in language - on a single financial settlement and on the rights of EU citizens in the UK - toughen up the conditions that the UK will have to meet.  Of course there are differences of emphasis in different national capitals - Poland is understandably more concerned than most about the rights of its citizens in the UK because there are so many of them; the Dutch are eager to start talks on future trade relations with the UK sooner rather than later, but they also want to ensure that the UK pays its divorce bill in full.  For now the emphasis on unity is real, and the determination for the EU to negotiate as one should not be underestimated in London.  Speaking earlier, French President François Hollande said there would inevitably be ""a price and a cost for the UK - it's the choice that was made"". ""We must not be punitive, but at the same time it's clear that Europe knows how to defend its interests, and that Britain will have a weaker position in the future outside Europe, than it has today within Europe."" On the issue of the UK's financial obligations, EU officials estimate that Britain faces a bill of €60bn (£51bn; $65bn) because of EU budget rules. UK politicians have said the government will not pay a sum of that size. Britain certainly won't tamely accept that it has to pay a huge divorce bill - but it's likely to find the Europeans united on the concept if not the precise amount, the BBC's Kevin Connolly in Brussels says. UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said in response that both sides wanted the negotiations to be conducted with goodwill. But he added: ""There is no doubt that these negotiations are the most complex the UK has faced in our lifetimes. They will be tough and, at times even confrontational"".",Sunday 30 April 2017,30-Apr-17,UK must ensure EU citizens' rights - Tusk,The top EU figure puts rights centre stage as the EU-27 formally approve negotiating guidelines.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39755124
"Anthony Joshua stops Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round at Wembley By Luke Reddy BBC Sport at Wembley Stadium Anthony Joshua produced the performance of his career to add the WBA world heavyweight title to his IBF crown with an enthralling knockout win over Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium. A post-war record 90,000 fans at the national stadium were treated to a see-saw contest, Joshua dropping the former unified world champion in the fifth round, before being put down - for the first time in his 19-fight career - in the sixth. Both men looked in danger of being stopped over two rounds which will live long in the memory, before Joshua delivered the clinical blows in the 11th. The Briton landed a brutal uppercut which gave him the platform to send Klitschko down with an immediate flurry. 
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         The Ukrainian stood, was dropped by a left hook again moments later, then stood again, only for referee David Fields to save him when pinned against the ropes. Joshua threw his arms into the air as roars rolled down the Wembley tiers. He had come through his stiffest test to date, while Klitschko too had answered questions, showing he remains competitive at world level, even at 41. He will rue not finishing the job when he floored Joshua and appeared tantalisingly close to reclaiming two of the titles he lost in his last fight against Tyson Fury in 2015. At the time of the stoppage, Joshua was up 96-93 and 95-93 on two cards, with Klitschko leading 95-93 on the other. After lengthy ring walks, fireworks, deafening noise and a rousing British national anthem, an opening six minutes of skill over power played out. Klitschko flicked his jab, his left hand waving in front of Joshua's face. Feints from both men stood out as they hunted openings. A solid right hand early in the fourth caught Joshua, who responded with the same shot later in the round, nodding at his rival on the bell. And then came the power punching in a pulsating fifth round. Joshua shook his man before sending him down face first with a flurry of punches. The crowd sensed blood, urging the Briton forward, only for Klitschko - cut above his left eye - to show the heart which has made him the most dominant heavyweight of the 21st century.  He pinned Joshua to the ropes, turning the round on its head, and then came out in the sixth to administer an overhand right which crumpled the champion. In uncharted waters, Joshua answered the count and faced a stiff examination before the bell. This was now an epic, living up to the hype, heavyweight boxing at its most captivating. The pace dropped, it had to, though any fear of Joshua's career-high weight slowing him down was unceremoniously put to bed in the 11th as his power unified the titles.  The sweat flew from Klitschko's head as the telling uppercut landed crushingly, before Joshua hunted down his opponent to seal a historic win. Less than three years ago, Joshua fought here low down the Froch-Groves undercard, but 13 fights later he stood centre stage, seeking a win promoter Eddie Hearn said would make him ""the biggest star in British sport"". Hearn, a bevy of global sponsors and a sizeable entourage have backed and built the Joshua brand - investment which looks stunningly astute on a night when his reputation was further enhanced. Through his litany of knockout wins there have been question marks. Could he withstand punishment? Did he have the skills to match a world-level fighter? He answered emphatically, complementing solid technique early on with resistance when troubled and brutal power down the stretch.  This bout was televised by two networks in the US, only the third time in history such a deal has been struck, and the Las Vegas fight nights enjoyed by Lennox Lewis - the last undisputed heavyweight champion - look to be on the cards. The wild celebrations of those closest to him underlined just what this meant. A man carrying a huge weight of expectation had delivered. Defiance has poured from Klitschko in recent months. The Ukrainian has compared himself to Everest, talked of an ""obsession"" in bouncing back from defeat by Fury, and preached about his peaceful state of mind as challenger, not champion. Such a steely demeanour hinted retirement in the short term was out of the question, and he is understood to still have three fights left on a contract with German broadcaster RTL. He looked a different fighter to the one beaten by Fury, and markedly better than in his latest points win over Bryant Jennings, but the size of his task was huge.  He was the underdog with bookmakers, with only George Foreman having won a recognised world title past the age of 40. The trademark jab and power right hand were on show, as was guts aplenty in getting up three times.  And, despite losing the richest bout in British boxing history - with an estimated £30m pot shared by the fighters, it is clear the fire still burns.

Joshua on BBC Radio 5 live: ""I knew it was possible to hurt him, but I am learning round by round. I'm learning under the bright lights.  ""I don't come to box, I come to hurt people. With all due respect, I came to hurt him.  ""At the end of the day, I figured out what I had to do and got him done.  ""I'm coming back to Wembley. I'll look forward to seeing you here again.

BBC Radio 5 live boxing commentator Ronald McIntosh ""What an epic display of determination and guts from both fighters.

"Anti-Trump climate change march draws thousands in US Thousands of people have taken part in protests around the US against the Trump administration's attitude towards climate change. The People's Climate March was timed to coincide with the symbolic 100th day of Donald Trump's presidency.  In Washington, a sea of protesters marched from Congress to the Washington Monument past the White House. However, Mr Trump was not there. Instead, he was  marking the milestone 100 days at a rally in Pennsylvania. Organisers of the march are critical of Mr Trump's attitude towards climate change. Mr Trump has called climate change a hoax, and has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement. They are also angry with the rollback of Obama-era environmental protections.  Reverend Leo Woodberry, of South Carolina, told a press conference ahead of the march: ""We're going to rise up and let them know that we're sick and tired of seeing our children die of asthma. ""We're sick and tired of seeing people with cancer because of coal ash ponds. We're sick and tired of seeing sea-level rise."" Celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and former Vice President Al Gore, were expected to march as well. The sweltering heat has not deterred them. Their signs read ""The seas are rising and so are we""; ""Make America think again""; and ""There is no planet B.""  This eclectic crowd of old and young - Buddhist monks and native American groups - are angry at the Trump administration's attitude toward the environment.  President Trump has called climate change a hoax. In his first 100 days, he has undone several of his predecessor's environmental regulations in the name of boosting American industry and energy.  Organisers say this march will help put the climate debate front and centre in forthcoming elections.",Sunday 30 April 2017,30-Apr-17,US climate change march draws thousands,People took part in the march to protest Donald Trump's climate policies on his 100th day in office.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39759505
"Turkey sacks 4,000 more officials in coup-bid crackdown The Turkish government has sacked almost 4,000 more public officials in what appears to be the latest purge related to a failed coup last July. They include more than 1,000 justice ministry workers, a similar number of army staff and more than 100 air force pilots, officials said. In a separate decree, Turkey banned TV dating shows - a move previously mooted by the government. Earlier on Saturday, Turkey blocked the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia. The latest sackings follow the suspension of more than 9,000 police officers and the arrest of 1,000 more last Wednesday on suspicion of having links to the US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating last year's coup attempt, a charge the cleric denies. The government said in its Official Gazette that all those sacked were suspected of links to ""terrorist organisations and structures presenting a threat to national security"".  Mr Erdogan narrowly won a controversial 16 April referendum on increasing his powers. Opponents fear the vote, which has divided Turkey, brings him closer to authoritarian rule. The ban on TV dating programmes follows a warning in March by Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus that the shows do not fit in with Turkish traditions and customs. ""There are some strange programmes that would scrap the institution of family, take away its nobility and sanctity,"" he said at the time. Critics of Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) say they fear the country is sliding toward conservative Islam under Mr Erdogan. However, AKP supporters say dating shows receive thousands of complaints and the ban is in the public interest. The block on Wikipedia was detected at about 08:00 (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, the Turkey Blocks monitoring group said. Turkey's Information and Communication Technologies Authority said an ""administrative measure"" had been taken but did not give details. Turkish media said Wikipedia had been asked to remove content by certain writers whom the authorities accuse of ""supporting terror"" and of linking Turkey to terror groups.  The site had not responded to the demands, the daily newspaper Hurriyet said, and the ban was imposed as a result. A formal court order backing up the provisional order is expected in the coming days. Responding to the ban, Wikipedia's founder Jimmy Wales tweeted: ""Access to information is a fundamental human right. Turkish people, I will always stand with you to fight for this right."" Turkey has temporarily blocked social media sites including Facebook and Twitter in the past, usually following protests or terror attacks.",Sunday 30 April 2017,30-Apr-17,"Turkey sacks 4,000 more officials",The latest purge comes alongside a ban on TV dating shows and the blocking of the website Wikipedia.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39759050

"France election: Marine Le Pen would make Dupont-Aignan PM French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has said she will make a defeated rival her prime minister, if elected. Ms Le Pen, of the far-right National Front (FN), chose Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, of the mainstream nationalist ""Stand Up France"" in an apparent bid to attract his voters. Mr Dupont-Aignan had already backed Ms Le Pen for the second round. Ms Le Pen faces centrist Emmanuel Macron in the second, decisive round of voting, which takes place on 7 May. Mr Dupont-Aignan, who got 4.7% in the first round, stood on a platform of leaving the euro and scrapping the European Union, higher ethical standards for elected officials, and focusing on the fight against jihadist terrorism.

"Italian woman 'returns mixed-race surrogate baby' An Italian woman is accused of faking a pregnancy and then giving back the baby she bought, after finding out the child was mixed race. The 35-year-old is accused of paying 20,000 euros ($21,800; £16,800) for the baby girl. She has been arrested along with the child's biological mother and a Moroccan man who allegedly helped broker the deal. Surrogacy is illegal in Italy, and attracts prison time and heavy fines. The ""fake"" mother is said to have told police she wore a decoy latex belly bought online to trick her friends and family. Italian press reports said her partner was in prison for drug trafficking, and that she had recently suffered two miscarriages.  The baby's biological mother, a 25-year-old Romanian woman, reportedly fell pregnant after a short relationship with a man from Mali. When she learned about the baby's race, the Italian woman is said to have realised she would not be able to explain the child's skin colour. After just three days, reports say, she gave the baby back. Suspicions were first raised in February at the registry office in the city of Latina, south of Rome, when a woman asked how to register a baby that had been born at home. When nobody returned to register the child, officials got in touch - but are said to have received evasive answers. Fearing something was amiss, they flagged the case up to police. Investigators found the baby girl in a healthy state with her biological father, who works in Rome.  She is now just over a month old, and has been placed in foster care.",Sunday 30 April 2017,30-Apr-17,Mixed-race surrogate baby 'returned',An Italian woman is accused of faking a pregnancy and then giving back the baby she bought.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39755742
"Arkansas execution: Judge orders post-mortem A judge has ordered a post-mortem exam on the body of a man executed by lethal injection who was reportedly in pain during his final moments. District Judge Kristine Baker's order came hours after Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson dismissed calls for an in-depth review. Kenneth Williams, the fourth prisoner executed in eight days, convulsed and groaned, witnesses said. His lawyers described his death on Thursday as ""horrifying"". In addition to the examination, Judge Baker also ordered the preservation of blood and tissue samples from Williams's body. Her decision came after Jason McGhee, a death-row inmate who had also been scheduled to die on Thursday, filed an emergency order. He and three others who had been scheduled to die before the state's supply of sedative - part of the lethal injection used to execute prisoners - runs out have all won reprieves. Earlier, Governor Hutchinson had rejected calls for anything more than a ""routine"" check into the execution, while Senator Trent Garner - who witnessed the execution - said Williams did not ""seem in pain"". But Shawn Nolan, who represented Williams, filed a motion which argued that if ""the [drug] midazolam fails to keep the prisoner under anaesthesia, the prisoner would be awake and aware but unable to move or speak or even open his eyes, so he would then look completely serene despite being in agony"". Williams was initially spared the death penalty when he was sentenced to life in prison for the 1998 murder of 19-year-old cheerleader Dominique Hurd.  After a month in the penitentiary, he escaped in October 1999 by hiding in a barrel used to carry kitchen refuse. Not far from the prison, he encountered Cecil Boren, 57, on his farm. He killed Mr Boren, shooting him multiple times, and stole his Ford F-150 pick-up truck. Williams drove north to Missouri, where he led police on a chase that caused the high-speed death of 24-year-old delivery driver Michael Greenwood.

"North Korea crisis: North in another 'failed' missile launch North Korea has test-fired another ballistic missile, South Korean and US military officials say. The missile exploded shortly after take-off, they said - the second failed launch in the past fortnight. US President Donald Trump accused North Korea of showing ""disrespect"" towards China and its president. The missile was fired from a site in South Pyeongan province, north of Pyongyang, in the early hours of Saturday local time, South Korea said. It came just hours after the United Nations Security Council discussed North Korea's missile programme. Mr Trump tweeted: ""North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!"" Mr Trump recently hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and praised him for ""trying very hard"" on North Korea. Tensions in the region have increased lately, with both North and South Korea conducting military exercises. North Korea is believed to be continuing efforts to miniaturise nuclear warheads and fit them on long-range missiles capable of reaching the US. It is not known what kind of missile was unsuccessfully launched on Saturday, however, one official told Reuters it was probably a medium-range missile known as a KN-17. The land-based, anti-ship ballistic missile has already had two failures, but its message is that US, South Korean and Japanese ships should beware. Meanwhile, an American aircraft carrier - the USS Carl Vinson - has reportedly arrived in the region after it was sent to the Korean peninsula as part of Mr Trump's ""armada"". The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JSC) said in a statement that the ""unidentified missile"" was fired ""from a site in the vicinity of Bukchang in Pyeongannam-do (South Pyeongan Province)"" early on Saturday. Commander Dave Benham, a spokesman for US Pacific Command, also said the launch had occurred near the Bukchang airfield. He added that the missile did not leave North Korean territory. After Saturday's failed launch, the Japanese government condemned the test and said it had lodged a strong protest with North Korea through its diplomatic channels. North Korea has had two failed missile launches this month - but that does not mean they will always fail, an expert has said. Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, told the BBC this was to be expected when testing a new missile as there was such a variety of things which could go wrong. ""Every time you have a new missile there are going to be growing pains,"" he said. ""There is nothing unusual if it is new missiles. ""It will fail until it doesn't.

Mr Lewis also rejected suggestions a US cyber attack might have been behind the recent failures, pointing to successful launches in Iran. ""If they are hacking the North Koreans, they would be hacking the Iranians,"" he noted. The US has threatened to use military force in North Korea if necessary. On Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused UN Security Council members of not fully enforcing existing sanctions against the North, and called on China in particular to use its trade links as influence.

On Friday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused UN Security Council members of not fully enforcing existing sanctions against the North, and called on China in particular to use its trade links as influence. But Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the key to solving the problem did not lie with his country.

"El Salvador zoo: Prosecutors investigate 'suspicious deaths' Prosecutors in El Salvador have opened an inquiry following the suspicious deaths this week of a puma and a young monkey at the National Zoo.  Prosecutors suspect the animals became ill through neglect.  The investigation will also look into the death of a zebra at the same location earlier this month.  Those deaths follow that of a hippo called Gustavito at the National Zoo in February, which caused outrage in El Salvador and beyond.  Staff initially said that the hippo had been stabbed and beaten by unknown assailants.  Following the death, zoo director Vladlen Hernandez said he did not believe employees were involved in any attack and added that the zoo had received no threats from any of the street gangs that terrorise the Central American nation. Police later questioned employees of the zoo to try to establish who could have entered the premises to carry out such an attack. But investigators later concluded that the animal had died as a result of poor care. A detailed examination showed that the hippo had apparently died of a pulmonary haemorrhage, or bleeding from the lung, state prosecutor Mario Salazar said. The animal had been ill for 17 days before dying. The latest deaths at the zoo happened on Thursday night.   The authorities say puma Soberana (Sovereign) was old and ill, and being treated for a gut problem.  Reports say the baby monkey died in an accident. But prosecutors decided to look into the circumstances of the deaths. On Friday, El Salvador's Culture Ministry also announced it will revamp the National Zoo. ""The traditional zoo concept is already obsolete,"" said the ministry in a statement.

"Pope Francis celebrates Mass in packed Cairo stadium Pope Francis has celebrated Mass in Cairo for about 15,000 believers on the final day of his visit to Egypt. The worshippers gathered in a stadium, waving flags and releasing balloons as the Pope made his entrance.  His visit comes three weeks after the so-called Islamic State (IS) killed at least 45 people at two Egyptian churches.  The Pope has used the visit to build ties with Muslim leaders and appeal for religious freedom. For a Christian community that has felt under siege, and for a nation in the midst of three-month state of emergency, today's Mass was a rare opportunity to worship and celebrate in the open-air at Cairo's Air Defence Stadium. Pope Francis, who was rapturously welcomed, circuited the stadium in an unprotected ""popemobile"" before processing with a large group of local clerics toward the stage.     He began his brief address in sombre mood, referring to the condition of the disciples following Christ's crucifixion. He said they returned ""full of despair and disappointment… The Master is dead, and thus it is pointless to hope. They feel disappointment and despair"". But he said their lives were transformed by the resurrection. And then he returned to a theme that he has repeated throughout this visit, that only those who behave with compassion can truly claim to be believers - believers of any religious faith.   ""God is pleased only by a faith that is proclaimed by our lives, for the only fanaticism believers can have is that of charity. Any other fanaticism does not come from God and is not pleasing to Him."" His words were a deliberate echo of what he said at the historic al-Alzhar University, where he spoke largely to Muslims and argued that ""We have an obligation… to expose attempts to justify every form of hatred in the name of religion"". Pope Francis has laid down a challenge to both Christians and Muslims in Egypt to be fanatical about their faith, but in a way that leads only to engagement and compassion.

"Donald Trump: N Korea's Kim Jong-un a 'smart cookie' US President Donald Trump has described North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a ""pretty smart cookie"". Speaking to CBS, he noted Mr Kim had assumed power at a young age, despite dealing with ""some very tough people"". Amid escalating tensions over North Korea's nuclear programme, he said he had ""no idea"" whether Mr Kim was sane. The North Korean leader had his uncle executed two years after he came to power, and is suspected of ordering the recent killing of his half-brother. President Trump, asked what he made of the North Korean leader, answered: ""People are saying: 'Is he sane?' I have no idea.... but he was a young man of 26 or 27... when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others. ""And at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie."" The interview on the Face the Nation show came after North Korea's second failed ballistic missile test in two weeks, in which a missile exploded shortly after it was launched on Saturday. When asked why the missiles ""keep blowing up"", Mr Trump said: ""I'd rather not discuss it."" ""We shouldn't be announcing all our moves,"" he said. ""It is a chess game. I just don't want people to know what my thinking is."" North Korea is believed to be continuing efforts to miniaturise nuclear warheads and fit them on long-range missiles capable of reaching the US.  Tensions in the region have increased lately, with both North and South Korea conducting military exercises. America sent warships to the region and began installing a controversial anti-missile system in South Korea earlier this week. On Sunday, an article from Pyongyang's state-run news agency KCNA urged the US to ""ponder over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their foolish military provocation"". North Korea has carried out repeated missile tests in recent months and is threatening to conduct its sixth nuclear test.  President Trump said the US was ""not going to be very happy"" if further tests were carried out. When asked whether this would mean military action he said: ""I don't know. I mean, we'll see."" Mr Trump said the Chinese President Xi Jinping, an ally of North Korea, was ""putting pressure"" on Mr Kim to scale back his nuclear and military activities. ""But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has,"" he said. He again hailed the ties he has been developing with China, a country he criticised heavily during his election campaign.  ""The relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had,"" Mr Trump said. When asked whether he would fulfil his campaign pledge to label China a currency manipulator, he said ""as soon as I got elected, they stopped"", but implied he did not want to jeopardise Chinese co-operation on North Korea. ""North Korea is maybe more important than trade. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.""

"Eike Batista: Brazilian ex-billionaire leaves jail A Brazilian oil and mining magnate, who was once one of the richest men in the world, has left a notorious prison in Rio de Janeiro for house arrest ahead of a corruption trial.  Eike Batista had an estimated worth of more than $35bn (£27bn) five years ago, but lost most of it as his empire collapsed.  He is accused of bribery and hiding illegal funds offshore, but denies any wrongdoing.  He was arrested in January.  Mr Batista's lawyers argued that he had been put in prison merely to placate public opinion.   High court judge Gilmar Mendes ruled that Mr Batista could await his trial under house arrest because none of the alleged crimes involved violence or threats to others. Under Brazilian law, Mr Batista would have been sent to a special prison wing if he had held a university degree.   But as he dropped out before finishing his engineering degree in Germany, he was serving time in an ordinary cell with six other inmates at the Bangu penitentiary. Many Brazilian jails are overcrowded and controlled by criminal gangs. The authorities in Rio say, however, that is not the case at Bangu. Under the terms of his release, Mr Batista must remain at his home in Rio de Janeiro and can be visited by the police at any moment without warning.  He is also not allowed to act as a director of his remaining companies.  He will stand trial alongside the ex-governor of Rio de Janeiro, Sergio Cabral, who allegedly took $16.5m in bribes from Mr Batista.  The former billionaire is also facing accusations in the United States, where investors argue that he knew that oil exploration contracts won by one of his companies were worthless.  They also allege that he lied about new oil discoveries worth trillions of dollars. Mr Batista denies the charges, and has said he will help the authorities in their efforts to tackle corruption - which he says is widespread in Brazil.",Monday 01 May 2017,1-May-17,Brazilian ex-billionaire leaves jail,"Eike Batista, who is accused of bribery and tax evasion, is released from jail ahead of his trial.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39766273
"Ueli Steck: Everest preparation claims 'Swiss Machine' climber The Swiss climber Ueli Steck has been killed preparing to climb Mount Everest, Nepal's tourist office says. Steck, who was known as the ""Swiss Machine"", died in an accident while acclimatising for an attempt on the mountain without oxygen by a new route. The 40-year-old had won multiple awards and was known for his rapid ascents. His body has been recovered from the base of Mount Nupste, which shares a common ridge with Everest, after he was spotted by fellow climbers. ""He had an accident on the Nuptse wall and died. It seems he slipped,"" Ang Tsering Sherpa, head of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told news agency AFP. Steck was preparing to climb Mount Everest using its West Ridge, a route which has been the cause of more deaths than successful ascents, followed by Lhotse, the fourth highest mountain in the world. It is believed he was alone on Sunday due to his climbing partner contracting severe frostbite. On Wednesday, Steck wrote on his Facebook page that he had a ""quick day from Basecamp up to 7,000m and back"" as he believed ""active acclimatisation"" was the most effective way of getting used to high altitude. The climber reached Mount Everest's summit without oxygen in 2012, and in 2015 climbed all 82 Alpine peaks over 4,000m (13,100ft) in 62 days. Steck had returned to the world's tallest mountain four years on from an altercation with sherpas which caused him to abandon an attempt to climb Everest and Lhotse.  In a video about his Everest-Lhotse project ahead of his departure for the Himalayas, Steck said he felt super-ready and psyched. ""My body is as strong as it was never before,"" he added. Asked about his definition of success for the ambitious plans to traverse Everest and Lhotse via the Hornbein Couloir, Steck said: ""If you have an accident or if you're going to die, that's definitely not successful, all the other things, it's a success already."" ""Why do I have to attempt Everest and Lhotse? Yet again, the answer is simple: I get to stay longer in the mountains. ""And now I'll just go, and only worry about the events that lie ahead of me. Day by day, one by one. It is the here and now that counts. What comes next is uncertain in any case. ""Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow."" Read more on Ueli Steck's website Last year Steck and fellow climber David Goettler found the bodies of two American mountaineers in Tibet, 16 years after they were killed by a huge avalanche. Veteran British mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington paid tribute to Steck, describing him as ""one of the great climbers of all time"". He said that Steck's reputation for speed climbing had not necessarily put him at greater risk. ""What kills most people is the objective dangers, going into an area where there is stone fall or the threat of avalanche,"" he told the BBC's Newshour programme. ""The longer you are exposed to that threat, statistically the more likelihood there is of you being hit by one of these things. Whereas if you are moving very fast you are exposed to that danger for a much shorter time. ""But the people who are climbing at the absolute limit, which he undoubtedly was, the death rate among the very best mountaineers is very high, particularly in the Himalayas."" British mountaineer Kenton Cool described Steck as ""a true inspiration"" who ""showed us all what was possible in the mountains and beyond"". The British Mountaineering Council described him as a ""legendary mountaineer and all-round great guy"". Ueli Steck set new standards in alpine climbing - setting a string of records for making breathtakingly quick solo ascents of classic routes.  He also played a big part in bringing the sport to a new audience through the epic films made of his exploits.  He was nicknamed the ""Swiss Machine"" for his ruthlessly methodical approach and his ability to keep going even after pushing himself to the limits of human endurance. In 2015 he climbed one of the world's most famous walls, the North Face of the Eiger, in two hours 47 minutes - a time that would have been unthinkable to the early pioneers of the sport, who took days to complete it. In 2015, he improved on that feat with a time of two hours 22 minutes and 50 seconds.

"French forces kill militants in Mali forest France says its forces in West Africa have killed or captured more than 20 militants in a forest near Mali's border with Burkina Faso. A statement by its regional force said air and ground forces were involved. It did not identify the militant group. A French soldier was killed in the area earlier this month. Mali suffers frequent attacks by Islamist militants despite a French military operation in 2013 to drive jihadists from northern cities. A French military spokesman said the militants had been targeted in the Foulsare forest, in the south-west of Gao province. On Saturday,  Mali's National Assembly voted to extend a state of emergency by six months in a bid to quell an upsurge in attacks. Violence has also intensified in neighbouring Burkina Faso.  In December, 12 soldiers were killed in an attack by militants near Burkina Faso's border with Mali. In January last year, 29 people, many of them foreigners, died in a attack on a hotel in the capital Ouagadougou. France, the former colonial power in Mali, has deployed about 4,000 soldiers in the region to fight extremists.

"Swiss 'spy' arrested in Frankfurt A Swiss man has been arrested in Frankfurt on suspicion of spying. German federal prosecutors said the man was suspected of having worked ""for the intelligence service of a foreign power"" since early 2012. Reports suggest the man may have spied on German tax investigators. Tax authorities in Germany have controversially bought CDs of information from whistleblowers in Swiss banks as they try to catch German residents with Swiss bank accounts. The issue has caused friction between the Swiss and German governments. Authorities in Germany's federal states have justified the hefty payments by saying the information gained would lead to much larger sums in unpaid taxes being retrieved. But Switzerland thinks paying people who steal information from Swiss banks is wrong. German football star's own goal on tax The 54-year-old, named only as Daniel M, was taken into custody on Friday, prosecutors said, but an arrest warrant had been issued for him in December. Several residential and business premises in Frankfurt and the nearby Wetterau region were searched by officers from the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA).",Monday 01 May 2017,1-May-17,Swiss 'spy' arrested in Germany,The man is suspected of spying on German tax investigators who have bought CDs from Swiss banks.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39763293
"Fifa: Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah resigns following denial of any wrongdoing   High-ranking Fifa official Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah has resigned a day after denying claims linking him to a fraud case. Following the release of court documents, Kuwaiti Sheikh Ahmad was linked in media reports to Richard Lai, the Fifa audit and compliance committee member who was banned for bribery. Lai admitted taking $950,000 (£735,000) in bribes in a US Court on Thursday. In a statement, Ahmad said he ""vigorously"" denies any wrongdoing. The 53-year-old, a member of both Fifa's ruling council and president of the Olympic Council of Asia, had admitted on Saturday to being aware of the media speculation but said he was ""very surprised"" by the allegations. Court documents in Lai's case did not directly name Sheikh Ahmad but referred to someone who ""at various times"" was a ""high-ranking official of Fifa, the Kuwait Football Association (KFA), and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)"". And in a second statement announcing his resignation, Ahmad said it was in Fifa's ""best interests"" for him to go. ""With regards to alleged illegal payments to Richard Lai, I can only refer to my previous statement and vigorously deny any wrongdoing,"" it read. ""I intend to work with all relevant authorities to disprove these, for me, totally surprising allegations. ""However, I do not want these allegations to create divisions or distract attention from the upcoming AFC (Asian Football Confederation) and Fifa congresses.  ""Therefore, after careful consideration, I have decided it is in the best interests of Fifa and the AFC for me to withdraw my candidacy for the Fifa council and resign from my current football positions.  ""I have been honoured to serve on the Fifa council, Fifa reform committee and AFC for the last two years and I will continue to support the family of football once these allegations have been disproved."" Lai, president of the Guam Football Association and a US citizen, admitted two counts of wire fraud conspiracy - relating to accepting and paying bribes - and one count of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. He agreed to pay more than $1.1m (£850,000) in forfeiture and penalties. Following Ahmad's resignation, Fifa president Gianni Infantino stated: ""I have taken note of the decision of Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah.  ""I want to thank him for taking this decision which certainly was not easy to take but is in the best interest for Fifa."" BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah is one of the most powerful sports officials in the world. And chances are you've probably never heard of him. That's the way he likes it. He is a man who operates in the shadows. The Kuwaiti was a powerbroker in Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation. As it stands he still holds sway within the Olympic movement. He helped Thomas Bach get elected as IOC president in 2013, leveraging his position as president of the Olympic Council of Asia to deliver key votes for the German.  There was intriguingly no mention in his statement about his Olympic jobs though, showing he may want to cling on there. However, his resignation from football will help Fifa and the AFC limit the damage these allegations have caused.  Ahmad was identified in a US court case as allegedly giving bribes to another football official in return for votes and support. He denies any wrongdoing but his resignation from all of his football positions may now stop altogether, or at least delay, a lengthy and embarrassing ethics investigation from taking place.  Football's world governing body, trying to reassert its moral authority after years of financial and political scandal, will be thankful one of its top officials has gone relatively quietly.  However, there may be more pain to still to come. The US court case which prompted Ahmad to walk away marked a potentially significant move into alleged wrongdoing by Asian football officials for the first time.  Fifa president Gianni Infantino has already declared that the crisis for his organisation is over - Sheikh Ahmad's resignation shows there is quite clearly still some way to go before that rings true.

"Dozens of Yazidis enslaved by IS in Iraq now free Thirty-six members of the Yazidi religious minority are free after nearly three years in the hands of so-called Islamic State (IS), the UN says. They have been taken to UN centres in Dohuk in Kurdish northern Iraq.  It is unclear whether they escaped in Iraq or were freed, as the UN declined to give more information to avoid jeopardising future releases.  IS killed and enslaved thousands of Yazidis after seizing the northern town of Sinjar in 2014. Kurdish Peshmerga forces regained control in 2015 but many Yazidis were held captive by IS elsewhere as the group took over large swathes of northern Iraq.  The 36 survivors include men, women and children who were enslaved, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.  They reached Dohuk two nights ago where they are being housed in centres established by the UN Population Fund.  There, they are being reunited with family members and offered care including clothing and medical and psychological aid, the UN said.  The women and children are being cared for at dedicated service points and will be referred for more specialised treatment. The UN's humanitarian co-ordinator for Iraq, Lise Grande, said the UN was going to do ""everything possible"" for the rescued Yazidi. ""What these women and girls have endured is unimaginable,"" she said. Who, What, Why: Who are the Yazidis? The UN - which has accused IS of committing genocide against the Yazidi - estimates that 1,500 women and girls are still being held and could be suffering protracted sexual abuse. A UN report released last year said the extremists had subjected captured Yazidis to the ""most horrific of atrocities"", killing or enslaving thousands, warning IS aimed to completely erase their way of life. In March. lawyer Amal Clooney urged the UN to back a UK-led investigation into the crimes committed by IS. IS has been under increasing pressure in Iraq, losing much of the territory it seized in 2014.

"Indian brides given bats to keep abusive husbands in check Hundreds of brides at an Indian mass wedding have been given wooden bats and urged to use them as weapons if their husbands turn abusive. Messages such as ""for use against drunkards"" are written on the paddles, which measure about 40cm (15in) and are more traditionally used for laundry.

But if their spouses refuse to listen, they should let the paddles - known as mogri and usually used to beat dirt out of clothes - ""do the talking"", he said. Mr Bhargava posted pictures of the brides with the bats on his Facebook page.  He told AFP news agency that he had become concerned about the numbers of rural women who faced abuse from alcoholic husbands. ""Women say whenever their husbands get drunk they become violent. Their savings are taken away and splurged on liquor,"" he said. ""There is no intent to provoke women or instigate them to violence but the bat is to prevent violence.""

"Syria war: IS driven back in Tabqa, US-backed fighters say US-backed Syrian fighters say they have made more gains in their battle with Islamic State (IS) militants for the strategic city of Tabqa. Amid fierce street fighting, allied Kurdish and Arab militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they have captured six more districts. They are supported by elite US forces and air strikes by a US-led coalition. Tabqa has been a key IS command centre and is just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa, the group's Syrian stronghold. The SDF said in a statement that IS now controlled only the northern part of the city, next to the Tabqa dam. BBC World Service Middle East editor Alan Johnston says that if the SDF can capture Tabqa, it will be further evidence that IS is coming under greater pressure deep in what has been its Syrian heartland. IS captured the Tabqa dam in 2014, giving it control of a vital reservoir and a hydroelectric power station that supplies large parts of Syria. UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the SDF now had almost complete control over Tabqa but militants were using suicide attackers and car bombs to slow the advance. Many residents fleeing the fighting have been evacuated across nearby Lake Assad by SDF fighters using a makeshift ferry.  Ismail Mohamed, who fled with his family, said the situation in the city was dire. ""The humanitarian situation was really bad. People are hungry and tired,"" he said, quoted by AFP news agency. ""Everyone is psychologically shattered, crushed. When we got on the water, riding in the boat, we truly couldn't believe it, we were so happy."" Last month, the SDF paused its offensive to allow engineers to inspect the dam, amid fears that it had been damaged in the fighting. The UN had warned that if the dam were to collapse, it could lead to flooding on a massive scale with ""catastrophic humanitarian consequences"". Many civilians living downstream in Raqqa had begun fleeing their homes, activists said, but IS sent cars around the city with loudspeakers ordering people not to evacuate.",Monday 01 May 2017,1-May-17,IS 'loses ground' in key Syrian city,US-backed Syrian fighters say they have taken six more districts in the city to the west of Raqqa.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39765043

"Donald Trump: I would be honoured to meet Kim Jong-un US President Donald Trump has said he would be ""honoured"" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in the right circumstances. ""If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would - absolutely. I would be honoured to do it,"" he told news organisation Bloomberg on Monday. The previous day he described Mr Kim as a ""pretty smart cookie"". The comments come amid escalating tensions over North Korea's nuclear programme. The White House issued a statement following Mr Trump's remarks, saying North Korea would need to meet many conditions before any meeting between the two leaders could take place. Spokesman Sean Spicer said Washington wanted to see the North end its provocative behaviour immediately. ""Clearly conditions are not there right now,"" he added. In Sunday's interview with CBS, President Trump noted Mr Kim had assumed power at a young age, despite dealing with ""some very tough people"". He said he had ""no idea"" whether Mr Kim was sane. The North Korean leader had his uncle executed two years after he came to power, and is suspected of ordering the recent killing of his half-brother. President Trump, asked what he made of the North Korean leader, told CBS: ""People are saying: 'Is he sane?' I have no idea... but he was a young man of 26 or 27... when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others. ""And at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie."" On Saturday North Korea conducted its second failed ballistic missile test in two weeks. Tensions in the region have increased lately, with both North and South Korea conducting military exercises. The US sent warships to the region and began installing a controversial anti-missile system in South Korea last week. On Sunday, an article from Pyongyang's state-run news agency KCNA urged the US to ""ponder over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their foolish military provocation"". North Korea has carried out repeated missile tests in recent months and is threatening to conduct its sixth nuclear test.  President Trump told CBS the US was ""not going to be very happy"" if further tests were carried out. When asked whether this would mean military action he said: ""I don't know. I mean, we'll see.""",Tuesday 02 May 2017,2-May-17,Trump: I would meet Kim Jong-un,"The US president said he would meet the North Korean leader if it was ""appropriate"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39773337

Subway service was not affected, but police closed off the area near Bay Street and King Street. Some buildings have also been evacuated because of the smoke.

"Trump is considering new Glass-Steagall-style bank rules President Donald Trump on Monday said he is considering breaking up big Wall Street banks, by splitting their consumer business from their investment operations. ""I'm looking at that right now,"" he told Bloomberg News. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said there were no further details and no announcement was planned. Shares in banks initially fell after President Trump's comments before recovering ground. US banks were permitted to own both High Street banks and investment banking operations in 1999, when the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed. Some argue the repeal set the groundwork for the financial crisis in 2007-8.  During the campaign, President Trump expressed support for a ""21st-century"" Glass-Steagall Act. ""There's some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we're going to look at that,"" the president told Bloomberg, in response to a question about breaking up the banks. Donald Trump tells banks he will give laws a 'haircut' Viewpoint: Putting finance in its place US senators introduce 'new' legislation to separate banks But the odds of anything happening this year are low, according to Larry McDonald the author of A Colossal Failure of Common Sense, a book about the collapse of Lehman Brothers.  While keeping consumer deposits and riskier banking practices separate makes sense, Mr McDonald said the Trump administration has more pressing priorities, such as tax reform. ""With all the lobbyists and everything they have to do... this is way down the list,"" he said. Mr McDonald said there are good political reasons why the president might want to take a tough line on the banking industry. ""The average little guy loves to hear this, so he's going to score points with his base and it may not hurt him politically at all because it may not get done,"" he said. The idea has support from some key US congressional figures, such as Democrat Elizabeth Warren and Republican John McCain.  But any change is likely to face stiff resistance from the banking industry, making approval in Congress difficult. The American Bankers Association said on Monday it opposes reintroduction of Glass-Steagall. ""There is broad agreement, including among all our bank regulatory agencies, that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the crisis or the housing market collapse,"" association president Rob Nichols said in a statement. President Trump has also promised to roll back legislation covering the banking sector, including the Dodd-Frank regulations introduced following the financial crisis. Dodd-Frank was designed in part to protect consumer banking operations from riskier investment banking business.  Among other provisions, it required banks keep money in reserve at levels the president has said he thinks are onerous on smaller operations. Earlier, US Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin said he believed the American economy could be growing at a rate of three percent within two years, thanks to the administrations proposed tax reforms.  On the campaign trail Trump promised growth of 4% a year.

"Missing US teen refuses to return home from the Netherlands An American teenager who ran away last month has been found in the Netherlands and reunited with her mum, but is reportedly refusing to return home.  Margaret Lee flew from Tennessee to Amsterdam to meet someone she had been chatting with online. The 16-year-old was arrested by Dutch police in the city of Zwolle over the weekend on suspicion of identity theft.  Police say she used her sister's passport to leave the country after hers was confiscated by her family.  Ms Lee ran away from her home in Clarksville on 1 April, according to the Montgomery County Sheriffs office. She then flew to Amsterdam, via Iceland, by herself.  Dutch police began searching for the girl near The Hague, based on her details from her social media accounts.  Ms Lee was found by Dutch police at a train station in Zwolle, located about 75 miles (120km) east of Amsterdam.  She was reunited with her mother, who flew to the Netherlands to join the search.  Police have yet to reveal the identity of the person she travelled to meet. It is also unclear whether she will face any criminal charges in both the Netherlands and the US.

"Civil War historians take on Trump President Trump has caused controversy with a revisionist riff on Civil War history, telling journalist Salena Zito in an interview that Andrew Jackson could have prevented the war if he'd been president a little later, and that Jackson was ""really angry"" as he watched it unfold. Jackson, a slave-owner and strongman who took office in 1829, died 16 years before the war began. We asked three prominent Civil War historians - David Blight, from Yale; Judith Geisberg, from Villanova University; and Jim Grossman, from the American Historical Association - to parse Trump's comments, line by line. Giesberg: Trump has a fondness for Jackson. This isn't the first time he's cosied up to him and complimented him. He sees him as a fellow populist, someone who promised to give the White House back to the people. Grossman: There's a shared notion of what constitutes leadership. Something I think both men would see as very male. It's figuring out how to get what you want by pushing people as much as you can, rather than creating consensus. Blight: Jackson had a strong approach to the presidency, he invigorated executive power, and I suspect Trump likes that. Jackson was perceived as strong, as a military man. I mean, Trump is not a military man. Giesberg: Trump loves these kind of figures. They are a good cover for a man with no military experience, and who doesn't understand the military.  Blight: Other than that, it's a real-estate tycoon from New York and a slave-holder general from Tennessee. Not that close. Blight: I have no idea what he means here. A big heart certainly wasn't demonstrated by the Indian Removal Act.  Grossman: American Indians would probably question the size of Jackson's heart, or at least the quality of it. And Jackson was a slaveholder. If he did have a big heart, there were some obvious limits to it.  Grossman: He starts from the wrong premise - the premise that the Civil War should somehow have been avoided, and that someone more skilled on the White House could have avoided it. If one sees the Civil War as a war of liberation, which is what it was, then it shouldn't have been avoided. Had you compromised out the differences between the government and the confederacy, or between anti-slavery forces and southern slaveholders, the victims would have been the enslaved people of the south.  If the president has the notion that it would be desirable to compromise that out, without emancipation, it is frightening. Blight: If it reflects anything, it reflects a kind of great man idea of history, that if you just have the right man with the right strength you can change the course of history. And that is plain nonsense.  Grossman: Jackson died 16 years before the Civil War began. You can quote me on that.  Blight: He was dead even before the compromise of 1850 for God's sake. He was dead at the time of the Mexican war.  Grossman: I don't know what he means by this. The first Queen Elizabeth once said something about not wanting to draw windows into men's minds. She was a very astute woman.  Giesberg: Maybe he meant Andrew Johnson?  Grossman: It could be he has the wrong Andrew from Tennessee. Lincoln's successor Andrew Johnson was from Tennessee, and Trump is actually a lot like Johnson. Giesberg: People have been asking that question from the moment the war began. There are generations of answers. Historians have come to a consensus that slavery is the reason. We do ask the question, but it's not an answer everyone in America is convinced about. Grossman: When people say it was about state's rights, in 1861 states had nothing else to defend but slavery. They seceded because they thought the election of Lincoln threatened the institution of slavery. There are people who are not happy with that answer, who would like to see the Civil War as having been about something else.  Giesberg: I think it shows that he continues to be tone-deaf about contemporary racial issues. And I think it shows that he's selling a version of history that is useful for what he's trying to do today. But he might not have spent a huge amount of time on it. Blight: Jackson had absolutely no vision of any kind of racial egalitarianism. He had no hint of any kind of anti-slavery movement. And if President Trump doesn't understand anything about why we had a civil war, what can he understand about race relations now? Or about our problems with inequality? And he thinks Andrew Jackson would have prevented the war...

"San Diego pool party gunman called ex-girlfriend during attack Police say a man called his ex-girlfriend on the phone as he shot seven people at a pool party on Sunday. Peter Selis, 49, was depressed about the break-up and did not target his victims, who were black and Hispanic. ""These victims were just in his presence at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" said San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman, ruling out race as a factor in the attack. Selis killed one and injured six others before being shot dead by police. Officers responded to reports of a shooting at about 18:00 local time at the upmarket La Jolla Crossroads apartments. Mr Selis was sitting beside the pool, which was in the same apartment complex where he lived. From his lounge chair he began opening fire on the group, say police. After shooting two people, he placed a call to his ex-girlfriend. ""It is apparent that Selis wanted his ex-girlfriend to listen in as he carried out his rampage,"" said Mrs Zimmerman. Selis, who has no known criminal history, continued to speak as he fired on the crowd while they scrambled to flee the pool area.  A police helicopter observed him reloading his .45 caliber handgun while still inside the pool area. Moments later police on the ground shot him dead, after he raised his gun to fire on them.   In the days before the attack, Selis and his girlfriend had ended their relationship.  His family said he was ""distraught and depressed"", police said, but they had no indication that he would resort to violence. ""Based on the information we have gathered so far... it is very clear that Selis was very despondent over the break up of his girlfriend,"" said Mrs Zimmerman. One witness told KFMB-TV that Selis appeared to be drinking a beer during the gunfire, however, police did not confirm that detail. Another witness said Selis sat in a lawn chair during the incident, and was ""telling people to leave"". Police do not believe Selis knew any of the roughly 30 people at the party. Selis is white and his victims were four black women, two black men and a Hispanic man, but police have ruled out a hate crime. He was a resident of the same block of flats, where monthly rent ranges between $1,750 and $4,000. According to US media, Selis filed for bankruptcy in 2015. He listed his occupation as a car mechanic in court documents, and said he had two children and a stepson.",Tuesday 02 May 2017,2-May-17,Pool party gunman called ex during attack,The 49-year-old white gunman was despondent over a recent break-up with his girlfriend.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39772279
"'Extremely lucky' surfer found after 32 hours in sea An ""extremely lucky"" surfer has been found by a coastguard helicopter after 32 hours in the sea. Matthew Bryce, 22, from Glasgow, had not been seen since he set off to go surfing off the Argyll coast at 09:00 on Sunday. Belfast Coastguard said he had been in the water since 11:30 on Sunday and was found at 19:30 on Monday. A spokeswoman said Mr Bryce, who was wearing a wetsuit, was hypothermic and had been taken to hospital in Belfast. His condition was described as stable. Dawn Petrie, from the coastguard, said: ""He was extremely lucky.  ""Hope was fading of finding the surfer safe and well after such a long period in the water and with nightfall approaching we were gravely concerned but at 7.30pm tonight, the crew on the coastguard rescue helicopter were delighted when they located the man still with his surf board and 13 miles off the coast. ""He was kitted out with all the right clothing including a thick neoprene suit and this must have helped him to survive for so long at sea. He is hypothermic but conscious and has been flown to hospital in Belfast."" She told BBC Radio: ""He did the right thing by staying with his surfboard and that certainly aided his survival."" Belfast Coastguard co-ordinated the search for Mr Bryce who left to go surfing from Machrihanish beach near Campbeltown.

"Philippines President Duterte may turn down Trump's invite Philippines leader Rodrigo Duterte says he may be too ""tied up"" to accept President Donald Trump's invitation to the White House.  President Duterte said he ""cannot make any definite promise"" to travel to the US because of a busy schedule with trips planned to Russia and Israel.  Mr Trump extended the offer to Mr Duterte during a ""very friendly"" call the two leaders had on Saturday.  The Philippines leader has suggested he was open to better US relations. ""I am tied up,"" Mr Duterte told reporters on Monday when asked about Mr Trump's invitation, even though no firm date has yet been set for such a visit. ""I cannot make any definite promise. I am supposed to go to Russia, I am supposed to go to Israel."" He told reporters that his differences with the US had mainly been with former President Barack Obama, whom he once referred to as a ""son of a whore"".  ""It was not a distancing, but it was rather a rift between me, maybe, and the State Department and Mr Obama, who spoke openly against me,"" he said.  ""Things have changed. There's a new leadership."" During Saturday's phone call the two leaders discussed Mr Duterte's controversial war on drugs, which has left more than 7,000 people dead in under a year. The North Korea crisis was also raised. According to the White House, Mr Trump ""enjoyed the conversation"". The visit would be a chance ""to discuss the importance of the United States-Philippines alliance, which is now heading in a very positive direction"", a statement from the White House said. A meeting between Mr Duterte and Mr Obama was called off last year after he insulted the US president.  Mr Duterte has faced international condemnation for his brutal crackdown on drugs in the Philippines. Thousands of suspected drug dealers have been killed by police or vigilante groups, and tens of thousands more have been rounded up and arrested. Mr Duterte - who, like Mr Trump, was elected last year - has also said he would be happy to kill the country's millions of drug addicts. US Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called on Mr Trump to rescind his invitation. ""I am deeply disturbed by President Trump's cavalier invitation to President Duterte to visit the White House,"" he said in a statement.

"New Hamas policy document 'aims to soften image' The Palestinian militant group Hamas has published a new policy document - the first since its founding charter. It declares for the first time a willingness to accept an interim Palestinian state within pre-1967 boundaries, without recognising Israel. It also says Hamas's struggle is not with Jews but with ""occupying Zionist aggressors"". The 1988 charter was condemned for its anti-Jewish language. The text is seen as an effort by Hamas, which rules Gaza, to soften its image. ""The document gives us a chance to connect with the outside world,"" spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said.  ""To the world, our message is: Hamas is not radical. We are a pragmatic and civilized movement. We do not hate the Jews. We only fight who occupies our lands and kills our people."" Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, EU, UK and other powers. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was ""attempting to fool the world but it will not succeed"". ""They build terror tunnels and have launched thousands upon thousands of missiles at Israeli civilians,"" David Keyes added. ""This is the real Hamas."" In contrast to the charter, the new document does not mention Hamas's parent organisation, the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement banned in Egypt for being what Cairo sees as a terrorist group. Analysts say the decision is aimed at improving relations with the outside world, including Egypt and Gulf Arab states where the Brotherhood is also banned. Gaza has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt for the past decade, imposed to prevent attacks by militants inside the territory. Its economy has been crippled as a result, and many of its 1.9 million inhabitants suffer daily hardships. Relations between Hamas and Egypt have recently begun to improve, with a visit to Cairo earlier this year by deputy leader Ismail Haniya. For years there has been criticism of Hamas over the language of its charter, in particular articles which were branded anti-Semitic. The charter speaks of the need to fight ""warmongering Jews"" and cites a hadith - a report of what the Prophet Muhammad said or approved - that declares ""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews)"". It also refers to the ""Jews' usurpation of Palestine"" and accuses Jews of controlling the world's media and of being behind the French Revolution, secret societies and of controlling imperialist countries. Israel has occupied the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war. It pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, but still controls the air space, northern and eastern perimeter and waters around it. The new document, which Hamas says does not replace the charter, accepts the establishment of a Palestinian state within territories occupied by Israel in 1967 as a stage towards the ""liberation"" of all of historic Palestine west of the River Jordan. This is an apparent shift in Hamas's stated position, which previously rejected any territorial compromise. The document says this does not, however, mean Hamas recognises Israel's right to exist in any part of the land or that it no longer advocates violence against Israel. Hamas's announcement comes as Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, prepares to meet US President Donald Trump at the White House later this week.

"New Hamas policy document 'aims to soften image' The Palestinian militant group Hamas has published a new policy document - the first since its founding charter. It declares for the first time a willingness to accept an interim Palestinian state within pre-1967 boundaries, without recognising Israel. It also says Hamas's struggle is not with Jews but with ""occupying Zionist aggressors"". The 1988 charter was condemned for its anti-Jewish language. The text is seen as an effort by Hamas, which rules Gaza, to soften its image. ""The document gives us a chance to connect with the outside world,"" spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said.  ""To the world, our message is: Hamas is not radical. We are a pragmatic and civilized movement. We do not hate the Jews. We only fight who occupies our lands and kills our people."" Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, EU, UK and other powers. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was ""attempting to fool the world but it will not succeed"". ""They build terror tunnels and have launched thousands upon thousands of missiles at Israeli civilians,"" David Keyes added. ""This is the real Hamas."" In contrast to the charter, the new document does not mention Hamas's parent organisation, the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement banned in Egypt for being what Cairo sees as a terrorist group. Analysts say the decision is aimed at improving relations with the outside world, including Egypt and Gulf Arab states where the Brotherhood is also banned. Gaza has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt for the past decade, imposed to prevent attacks by militants inside the territory. Its economy has been crippled as a result, and many of its 1.9 million inhabitants suffer daily hardships.

"Turbulence injures 27 on Aeroflot flight to Bangkok At least 27 people were hurt when an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Bangkok hit a patch of severe turbulence. No injuries were life-threatening, but several passengers suffered broken bones and three needed surgery, Russian officials said. A passenger described being ""hurled"" up to the ceiling, trying to cling on amid shaking which ""wouldn't stop"". The turbulence occurred in clear skies, which meant the crew were not able to warn passengers, the airline said. ""The reasons behind the injures were that some of the passengers had not had their seatbelts fastened,"" Aeroflot said in a statement. Mobile phone footage of the aftermath of the incident showed injured people lying in the aisles, with packets of food and other items scattered on the floor. ""We were hurled up into the roof of the plane, it was practically impossible to hold on,"" a passenger who gave her first name as Yevgenia told Rossiya 24 by phone. ""It felt like the shaking wouldn't stop, that we would just crash,"" she added. The pilot, Aleksandr Ruzov, said the turbulence was ""impossible to predict"", in an interview with the Russia 24 news channel. He said the worst effects were felt at the back of the plane. CAT - clear air turbulence - is turbulence that occurs in otherwise calm, clear blue skies, without any visual indication such as clouds. It is caused when masses of air moving at different speeds meet, and can't be identified by the naked eye or conventional radar. Pilots use reports from other aircraft, passed on via air traffic control, to keep track of patches of clear air turbulence. Why is in-flight turbulence so unpredictable? Atlantic turbulence 'to hit flights', climate scientists say The incident took place about 40 minutes before the Boeing 777 carrying 313 passengers was due to land in Bangkok. Twenty-four of those injured were Russians while the other three were Thai, the Russian embassy in Thailand said. Fifteen people, including one child, were admitted to hospitals in Bangkok, a health ministry spokesman told the Russian news agency Interfax. Three people needed surgery, two for multiple leg fractures and one for broken ribs, he said. By early evening on Monday, 14 passengers remained in hospital, according to Aeroflot, which has said it will pay the medical costs of the injured. The airline said the pilot's experience amounted to more than 23,000 flight hours and that about 750 cases of clear-air turbulence are recorded in civil aviation every year.",Tuesday 02 May 2017,2-May-17,Turbulence injures 27 on Aeroflot flight,Many passengers suffered fractures as they were hurled around the cabin 40 minutes before landing.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-39771637
"Malta PM Joseph Muscat calls snap general election Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has called a snap general election for 3 June, a year before his term ends. The opposition has been calling for his resignation over allegations that his wife owned an offshore company in Panama. Mr Muscat and his wife, Michelle, deny the claims. A magisterial inquiry is under way. He said ""truth is on my side"" but that he wanted to protect Malta from uncertainty. The current scandal erupted earlier this month when the blogger Daphne Caruna Galizia made the claims, which she based on documents from the so-called Panama Papers, a leak of millions of files from the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Panama Papers: What happened next? Panama Papers: What is the scandal about? How assets are hidden and taxes dodged ""Everybody knows about the attacks made in the past few days on me and my family. I have nothing to fear because truth is on my side and I am clean,"" Mr Muscat said on Monday. ""My duty, however, is not just to protect myself but also to safeguard my country... We cannot allow uncertainty to slow the rhythm of Malta's economic miracle,"" he said. The country is enjoying record low unemployment and economic growth of more than 3.5 percent. But anti-corruption protesters took to the streets against Mr Muscat's government last week.  Opposition leader Simon Busuttil said on Monday that Mr Muscat was ""the dirty past of four corrupt years,"" local media reported.

"Venezuela's President Maduro calls for new constituent body Amid continuing anti-government protests, Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has called for a new constitution. Speaking at a May Day rally, Mr Maduro said a new constitution was needed ""to restore peace"" and stop the opposition from carrying out a ""coup d'etat"". He decreed that a citizens' assembly be convened to write the new document.  Opposition leaders said the move was aimed at neutralising the opposition-led legislature, the National Assembly. Speaking to thousands of his supporters, President Maduro said he would use his presidential power to convene a constituent assembly. He later issued a decree to that effect. Under the existing constitution, ""the people of Venezuela"" can ""convene a constituent assembly with the aim of transforming the state, creating a new legal framework and writing a new constitution"". Mr Maduro said that as president he was invoking that power in the name of the Venezuelan people.   Venezuela is embroiled in a deep economic and political crisis.  Over the past four weeks, there have been almost daily protests by those who blame President Maduro for the dire state of Venezuela's economy and who want him gone from power.  Almost 30 people have been killed in protest-related violence since the beginning of April.  Even as the president was speaking, police and anti-government protesters clashed in other parts of the capital. Mr Maduro says the opposition is trying to illegally overthrow his elected government and blames the country's problems on an ""economic war"" being waged against him. He argues that a new constitution will ""neutralise"" the opposition and defeat ""coup-plotters"" and thereby promote peace in Venezuela. ""I don't want a civil war,"" he told his supporters. Opposition leaders have denounced the move as an attempt by President Maduro to maximise his power and cling on to it for longer. They argue that the process of setting up a constituent assembly and drawing up a new constitution would almost certainly mean that regional elections due to be held this year and presidential polls scheduled for December 2018 would be delayed.  They also fear that the constituent assembly would further weaken the National Assembly, Venezuela's opposition-controlled legislative body. National Assembly leader Julio Borges called it ""a scam to deceive the Venezuelan people with a mechanism that is nothing more than a tightening of the coup in Venezuela"". ""It is Nicolas Maduro dissolving democracy and dissolving the Republic."" Faced with almost daily protests and increasing criticism from regional grouping the Organization of American States and the European Parliament, President Maduro probably felt he needed to make a move. Not willing to ""give in"" to the opposition's demand for early presidential elections, he chose to announce the creation of a constituent assembly. He has been accused by his detractors of becoming increasingly dictatorial and trying to cement his rule. He will argue that the constituent assembly hands power back to the people in the form of its 500 members. But government critics are already saying that such an assembly would not be representative of Venezuelan society as a whole and are questioning how its members would be chosen. President Maduro said that the constituent assembly would have 500 members and would be ""made up of workers"" and that political parties would have no role to play in the process. He said farmers, indigenous groups and women as well as retirees would all be represented in the new body.  He also said that between 200 and 250 of the members would be ""chosen by the working class"", although he gave no details of how exactly they would be elected. Support for Mr Maduro's governing socialist party has been strongest among the poorest parts of Venezuelan society, which benefitted most from the social programmes he and his predecessor in office, Hugo Chavez, introduced. The remaining members would be chosen at a municipal level through a direct and secret vote, he said.  Mr Maduro's push for a new constitution came as something of a surprise as the existing constitution was the idea of the late president Hugo Chavez, who was Mr Maduro's mentor. It was drawn up by a 131-member constituent assembly and overwhelmingly approved by the Venezuelan people in a referendum. It is frequently invoked by Mr Maduro, as well as his opponents, and Mr Maduro has not criticised it in the past.  If anything, Mr Maduro's announcement has further incensed opposition leaders, who called for fresh protests. ""People, into the streets! You must disobey such lunacy!"" opposition leader Henrique Capriles wrote on Twitter, calling the move ""a constitutional fraud"".

"US policeman admits guilt in driver death An ex-police officer has admitted violating the civil rights of a black man he was filmed shooting to death, in a case that sparked a national outcry. Michael Slager, who is white, could face decades in jail despite the state dropping the murder charge in a deal. Walter Scott was killed after Slager shot him in the back five times in North Charleston, South Carolina. A bystander filmed the 2015 incident on a mobile phone camera and Slager's actions were widely condemned. It came as the US grappled with a series of police killings that sparked a debate about the use of force against African Americans. Slager was fired by the force shortly after the video came to light. The incident was viewed millions of times online, and led to calls for the officer to face severe punishment. The plea deal does not carry a specific punishment, so Slager could face no prison time or life behind bars. He entered a guilty plea in front of his family, Scott's relatives and about 50 people who had gathered in the court. As part of the plea, he admitted to deprivation of rights under the colour of law, lying to state investigators, and using a firearm in a violent crime. ""Today is a victory for Walter,"" said Judy Scott, Walter Scott's mother. ""We got justice,"" she continued, adding that she forgave Slager for her son's death.  Andy Savage, a lawyer for Slager, said: ""We hope that Michael's acceptance of responsibility will help the Scott family as they continue to grieve their loss."" Slager had maintained that he shot Scott after he had taken his stun-gun during a tussle that broke out after he pulled over Mr Scott for having a broken tail light. An earlier murder trial in the state court ended in mistrial. In March, a judge ruled that jurors could view the video, despite Slager's defence team trying to prevent that. The plea deal makes no reference to Walter Scott's race. ""The defendant wilfully used deadly force even though it was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances,"" according to the plea agreement. ""The defendant acknowledges that during the time he used deadly force, he knew that the use of deadly force was unnecessary and excessive, and therefore unreasonable under the circumstances.""

"Alton Sterling shooting: No charges for police over black man's killing The US Department of Justice has decided not to charge two white officers who shot and killed a black man in Louisiana last summer. Video footage appearing to show the officers holding down Alton Sterling as they fired their weapons sparked days of protests in Baton Rouge. Us prosecutors said their was ""insufficient evidence"". News of the decision leaked to US media on Tuesday before the city mayor or the Sterling family had been told.  ""We need closure, we need a conviction. We need justice,"" said Sterling's aunt. More than 100 people attended a vigil on Tuesday night outside the Triple S Food Mart where Sterling died on 5 July 2016. The civil rights investigation was opened soon after the 37-year-old was killed outside the grocery shop where he was selling CDs. At the time, a series of fatal police shootings involving African-Americans had sparked a debate about police use of force. The federal decision not to prosecute the two officers comes with a new White House administration and a new head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But it is possible that the state of Louisiana could bring its own charges. Local officials expressed outrage that the federal authorities had not contacted the family ahead of the reported decision. ""I am appalled that this news, whether true or false, has been disseminated without a formal decision being relayed to the Sterling family first,"" Baton Rouge Mayor Sharon Weston Broome said, adding that her office had not been notified either. Police were called after reports of a man threatening people with a gun outside a shop. Mobile video footage appeared to show two officers wrestling a man in a red shirt to the floor. One of the officers pinned the man's arm to the floor with his knee and then appeared to pull out his gun and point it at the man. A voice is heard shouting: ""He's got a gun!"" Shots ring out and the camera moves away. Mr Sterling, a father of five, died at the scene. Police said he refused to comply with the officers' commands so they used a stun gun to bring him to the ground. The officers say they saw a gun in one of his pockets and saw his arm move there as if he was reaching for it, just before he was shot.  Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II were placed on administrative leave after the incident. There were nearly 200 arrests during protests over Mr Sterling's death, which preceded a turbulent couple of weeks in US race relations. A day after the fatal confrontation, a black driver in Minnesota was shot dead in a traffic stop, and the same week five police officers in Dallas were killed. Less than two weeks later, three police officers in Baton Rouge were killed in an ambush, further inflaming tensions in that community. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, who called the video footage ""disturbing"", called for a federal investigation into Sterling's death. Two other fatal police shootings were in the news on Tuesday. In Texas, police changed their story in what happened when an unarmed black teenager was shot and killed on Saturday night as his car drove away from police. And a former officer in South Carolina pleaded guilty to violating the civil rights of an African American he shot in the back as he ran away. Meanwhile, two Chicago police officers were shot and wounded late on Tuesday in a drive-by attack, authorities said.

"Brexit: Theresa May says she'll be 'bloody difficult' to Juncker Theresa May says she will be a ""bloody difficult woman"" towards European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker during Brexit talks. The PM revived a line used during her Tory leadership campaign to respond to claims the two clashed over dinner. She also declined to commit to settling the issue of expats' rights by June. EU sources claim UK misunderstanding of the talks process, and ignorance about how Brussels works, could lead to no deal being agreed on the UK's exit. According to German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine, the prime minister and Mr Juncker  clashed last Wednesday at Downing Street over Mrs May's desire to make Brexit ""a success"" and whether the issue of protecting the rights of expat UK and EU nationals could be agreed as early as June. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mrs May said there were a lot of similarities and common ground in the two sides' positions. She added: ""But look, I think what we've seen recently is that at times these negotiations are going to be tough. ""During the Conservative Party leadership campaign I was described by one of my colleagues as a bloody difficult woman. And I said at the time the next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker."" The ""bloody difficult"" quote came from former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke, who was recorded discussing her after a TV interview last year. Asked about the German newspaper report, Mrs May said: ""I don't recall the account that has been given of the meeting that took place, I think that a lot of this is Brussels gossip."" But she said that the talks would be tough and would involve either her or Jeremy Corbyn lining up for the UK against the other 27 EU leaders. Theresa May's comment is revealing about her strength, and also her weakness. No political leader wants to be seen to be pushed around. When the UK talked tough as a member of the EU the others had no choice but to listen. But now the UK is on the way out, the incentives for the others to pay attention - let alone do our bidding - is very different. Refusing to be pushed around is one thing, refusing to show any sign of compromise or listen quite another. Read more from Laura Pressed on whether she did believe the issue of the rights of EU nationals in the UK - and Britons abroad - could be settled in June, she said: ""I've always said that I want this to be an issue that we address at an early stage."" ""I've always said that there are complexities to this issue and lots of details that will need to be agreed. What people want to know is to have some reassurance about their future. I believe we can give that at an early stage. I've got the will to do this,"" she added. She also said she would have ""no intention of doing anything other"" than serving a full term until 2022 if she wins the 8 June general election. Opposition parties have accused the Tories of pursuing a ""hard Brexit"" strategy, with the PM insisting no deal is better than a bad one and planning to withdraw the UK from the EU single market. The first edition of the London Evening Standard published under the editorship of ex-chancellor George Osborne was headlined ""Brussels twists knife on Brexit"", with an editorial warning the PM against seeking a ""blank cheque"" from the EU. Launching his party's Brexit strategy, ex-Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Mrs May had ""chosen to pursue the most extreme and damaging form"" of EU departure. He said his party would offer another EU referendum in which it would campaign to Remain.

"Trump and Putin: Syria ceasefire heads leaders' agenda US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to press for a ceasefire to halt the war in Syria. The two spoke by telephone for the first time since the US launched air strikes against Syria nearly a month ago, straining relations. White House and Kremlin statements suggested a productive conversation. Other topics discussed included North Korea and the timing of a future face-to-face meeting. Mr Trump ordered cruise missile strikes on a Syrian government airbase following the deaths of more than 80 people in a suspected chemical weapons attack on the Syrian rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the incident was fabricated, while Russia, Mr Assad's main foreign backer, said at the time that it was caused by an air strike hitting a rebel depot containing chemical weapons. However in a statement on Tuesday, Mr Putin called for a full investigation into the incident and condemned ""any use of chemical weapons"". A White House statement said: ""President Trump and President Putin agreed that the suffering in Syria has gone on for far too long and that all parties must do all they can to end the violence. ""The conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons"". The Kremlin statement said the two men had agreed to step up attempts to find ways to strengthen a ceasefire. ""The aim is to create the conditions for the launch for a real resolution process in Syria,"" it added. Neither statement disclosed whether the two leaders had discussed the cruise missile strike. The White House also said Mr Trump and Mr Putin had also spoken about ""how best to resolve the very dangerous situation in North Korea"". The secretive communist state's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes have raised tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, with Mr Trump saying last week that a ""major, major conflict"" was possible. The Kremlin said: ""The dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula was discussed in detail. Vladimir Putin called for restraint and for the level of tension to be reduced.""     The two had also discussed organising a meeting - their first since Mr Trump was elected - during the G20 summit in Hamburg in early July, the Kremlin said.

"Hillary Clinton joins the 'Trump resistance' The election may be over, with Donald Trump's presidency more than 100 days old, but Hillary Clinton isn't ready to let go. In a brief but frank interview with foreign affairs reporter Christiane Amanpour at the Women for Women International event in New York City on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton said that she has conducted an ""excruciating analysis"" of her failed presidential campaign as part of a book she is writing. What has she learned? While admitting that she made mistakes and that her campaign had ""challenges"", ""problems"" and ""shortfalls"", she pointed the finger at two men - FBI Director James Comey and Russian President Vladimir Putin - as the proximate cause of her defeat. ""I was on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian Wikileaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me but got scared off,"" she said. ""The evidence for that intervening event is, I think, compelling."" Mrs Clinton also noted that as the first woman to run for president as a major party candidate, misogyny may have also been a factor in her loss. ""It is real,"" Mrs Clinton said of discrimination against women. ""It is very much a part of the landscape politically, socially and economically.""  She said her election would have been ""a really big deal"" for women's rights, sending a message around the world. At one point, Amanpour joked that the president would likely take to social media to respond to the former candidate's remarks . ""If he wants to tweet about me then I am happy to be the diversion because we have lot of things to worry about,"" Mrs Clinton said. By that evening, Mr Trump indeed offered his Twitter response, again saying the Russia allegations were a Democratic attempt to avoid blame for their defeat. Other opponents of the former secretary of state will be quick to point out that explaining away her campaign missteps as mere challenges, problems and shortfalls gives short shrift to strategic lapses that left her vulnerable to Mr Trump's economic populism, allowing him to prevail in the decisive Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Mrs Clinton's apparent response, however, is that she had to defend Mr Obama's presidential accomplishments and sell her pragmatic approach as the way to improve American lives. ""That was not as exciting as saying throw it all out and start over again, but it's how you make change in America - and lasting change that would improve people's lives,"" she said. When it came to foreign policy, Mrs Clinton shared some thoughts on the ""wicked problems"" currently confronting Mr Trump.  She said the effort to end North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes requires a regional effort, with US positions presented in critical negotiations and ""not just thrown off in a tweet some morning"". She also said she supported the recent US missile strike to punish the Syrian government for its use of chemical weapons, although she says she is not convinced it has made much of a difference. ""If all it was was a one-off effort,"" she said, ""it's not going to have much of a lasting effect."" Instead, Mrs Clinton is left trying to find her footing as an ex-candidate with no electoral prizes on the horizon for the first time since she emerged from her husband's political shadow. As her numerous swipes at the current president reveal, however, she may find an identity in opposition. ""I'm now back to being an activist citizen and part of the resistance,"" she said toward the end of her interview, referencing the label many of Mr Trump's liberal opponents have adopted. Playing backseat driver to the Trump presidency isn't where Mrs Clinton wanted to be, of course. It's not where, 10 days before last November's election, she thought she'd be. And dealing with it, she said, has been a ""painful process"".  If Mrs Clinton's psychological wounds never truly heal, she will hardly be the first to endure such lasting damage, as an anecdote recounted by political reporter Roger Simon reveals.  Shortly after his presidential defeat in 1984, Democratic nominee Walter Mondale called George McGovern, who was beaten by Republican Richard Nixon in 1972. When does the pain stop, he asked. When did you wake up in the morning and not feel like throwing up? ""I'll tell you when I get there,"" McGovern replied.

"Venezuela crisis: Opposition condemns Maduro move Opponents of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro have set up roadblocks and staged demonstrations demanding elections as the country's political and economic crisis deepens. They responded with defiance to his call for a new constitution to end unrest that has killed 28 people. Mr Maduro said his move was necessary to fend off a foreign-backed plot against him. The US said it was a bid to cling to power, while Brazil called it a ""coup"". The president's opponents want to hold a vote to remove him, blaming the left-wing president for food shortages that have led to rioting. Mr Maduro has rejected their calls and issued a presidential decree creating a 500-member ""constituent assembly"" to rewrite the constitution, a step that would bypass the opposition-controlled National Assembly.

There has been widespread international criticism of the move.  The head of the Washington-based Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, called it wrongheaded, unconstitutional and fraudulent. The US state department spokesman Michael Fitzpatrick told reporters: ""We have deep concerns about the motivation for this constituent assembly which overrides the will of the Venezuelan people and further erodes Venezuelan democracy. ""What President Maduro is trying to do yet again is change the rules of the game."" Brazilian Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes called the move a ""coup"".  ""It's another step in breaking the democratic order, which contradicts the country's own constitution,"" he said. In Venezuela itself, in the opposition-controlled National Assembly, lawmakers voted to reject the new body with many saying President Maduro was attempting to sideline the legislature and avoid new elections. The Venezuelan opposition have nowhere else to go but the streets and have vowed to keep up their latest month-long campaign of demonstrations across the country.  All their efforts to get an election called early have been frustrated by a Supreme Court and a National Electoral Council dominated by government supporters. Any legislation presented by Venezuela's National Assembly, which they dominate, is blocked by the judges.  Opposition leaders say Mr Maduro's constituent assembly is an attempt to sideline a democratically elected National Assembly even further. According to constitutional law, the new constituent body could overrule the executive, legislature and the judiciary.  Mr Maduro has said he wants at least half its members to come from his traditional powerbase - the poor, working classes and other civic associations. He says it will hand back power to the people and bring peace to Venezuela.  It seems to have done precisely the opposite. Mr Maduro was elected in 2013 to succeed the late Hugo Chavez, a popular figure who introduced wide-ranging social welfare programmes. But since then, falling prices for Venezuelan oil exports have cut government revenue and there have been shortages of food, baby milk, medicine and other basics. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that inflation in Venezuela will be above 700% this year. Presidential elections are due at the end of next year.

"Only one in four Middle East men backs equality, study suggests Only one in four men in the Arab world supports equality for women in some areas, and most still believe a woman's primary role is at home, a survey suggests. Interviews in Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco and the Palestinian territories also found that younger men mostly appeared to be as conservative as their fathers. But men in the region are said to face ""tremendous stress"" to be providers. This was especially true in places affected by conflict, the report says. The survey of 10,000 people co-ordinated by Promundo and UN Women found that between 20-50% of men across the four locations were ashamed to face their families due to a lack of work or money. ""There is the perception about the Arab region that the patriarchy clearly dominates and that it is fantastic for men,"" Shereen El Feki, who led the study, told the BBC. But ""the patriarchy works for the very small minority who are on the top of that pyramid,"" she added. ""For the rest down below, lots of women, but also from the results of the survey, many, many men, life is very tough"". The International Men and Gender Equality Study in the Middle East and North Africa (IMAGES MENA) found that the majority of men - up to 90% in some places - expected to control their wives' freedoms, from clothing to how often the couple had sex. Only about half of men, or fewer, believe married women should have the same right to work as men. At the same time, a majority in all four survey locations said they would accept having a female boss. However, the report said that it appeared men were only prepared to accept women working as long as the man remained the breadwinner and the woman remained primarily responsible for caring for the household. A quarter or more of the 4,830 men aged between 18 and 59 surveyed showed support for some dimensions of gender equality. ""These men question violence against women, agree with certain laws that safeguard women's rights, support women in leadership positions, and often want to spend more time caring for their children,"" the report says. Ms El Feki said it was surprising that women themselves upheld traditional notions around gender roles. For example, more than 70% of women said they wanted the right to work but the majority also agreed that when work is scarce men should have priority, she said. IMAGES studies carried out in more than two dozen countries have found that younger men have more liberal attitudes towards gender equality than their elders, but in the Middle East and North Africa, apart from Lebanon, this did not appear to hold. ""Younger women [are] much more open than their mothers or grandmothers, but younger men seem to be as conservative, perhaps even more so than their elders,"" Ms El Feki said. High unemployment and the struggle to find a job could be producing a ""backlash"" against gender quality, the report suggests, adding that a ""general climate"" of religious conservatism that young men have grown up in may also play a role. Yet if young men's fathers had more liberal attitudes, they are more likely to as well, the study says. ""The minority  of men who do get their hands dirty in the kitchen… what you find is that those are the men who saw their fathers doing this at home,"" said Ms El Feki.",Wednesday 03 May 2017,3-May-17,'One in four' Mid East men back equality,"Men in the region also find themselves under ""tremendous stress"", a large study suggests",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39784721
"Six on trial over topless photos of Duchess of Cambridge The Duke of Cambridge has said the publication of topless photographs of his wife in a French magazine was ""all the more painful"" given his mother's experience with the paparazzi. A statement from the duke was read at the French trial of six people accused of invasion of privacy and complicity. The images were taken as the royal couple holidayed in Provence in 2012. They appeared in Closer magazine in France, while regional newspaper La Provence printed swimwear pictures. Paris-based agency photographers Cyril Moreau and Dominique Jacovides are accused of taking long-lens shots of the royals, including the topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge, from a public road. The others accused in the case, being heard at Nanterre, near Paris, are Closer's editor Laurence Pieau, Ernesto Mauri, chief executive of the Mondadori group which owns the magazine, La Provence photographer Valerie Suau, and Marc Auburtin, the paper's publishing director at the time. A prosecutor urged the court to impose ""very significant fines"" while a lawyer for Prince William and Catherine called for ""very large damages"". Paul-Albert Iweins, representing Closer magazine, said the duke and duchess were hoping to claim 1.5 million euros (£1.3m) in compensation. He argued that the couple had been the subject of much media attention - including the broadcast of their wedding - and that the photos did not constitute a breach of privacy and cast them in a positive light. The royal couple had been staying at a chateau in Provence owned by Viscount David Linley, the nephew of the Queen. Prince William's written declaration was read out by the couple's lawyer Jean Veil. He said: ""My wife and I thought that we could go to France for a few days in a secluded villa owned by a member of my family, and thus enjoy our privacy. ""We know France and the French, and we know that they are, in principle, respectful of private life, including that of their guests."" He added: ""The clandestine way in which these photographs were taken was particularly shocking to us as it breached our privacy."" He said the images were ""all the more painful"" given the experience of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 as she was being pursued by photographers. The court heard mobile phone data had placed Mr Moreau, 32, and Mr Jacovides, 59, in the area between 4 and 6 September 2012, when the topless images are believed to have been taken. Both men deny they were responsible for the pictures used by Closer. Photographs of the duchess in her swimwear used in La Provence are said to have been taken by Ms Suau, 53, but she told the court there had been no intention to breach the royal couple's privacy. The duke and duchess are not due to attend the court, which is expected to announce its verdict on 4 July. In 2012 they launched legal proceedings and a court in Paris banned Closer, which is a separate publication from the UK's Closer magazine, from printing any further images.

"FBI woman went to Syria to wed IS recruiter she investigated The FBI has confirmed one of its translators travelled to Syria and secretly wed an Islamic State recruiter whom she had been investigating. The FBI ""took several steps in a variety of areas to identify and reduce security vulnerabilities"" after the incident, the agency told BBC News. Daniela Greene lied to her employers about her 2014 trip, reports CNN, which broke the story. The 38-year-old served two years in prison after fleeing back to the US. Greene's story was ordered to be kept secret by a US judge, but was revealed for the first time on Monday after federal court records were unsealed. The man whom Greene married, Denis Cuspert, is a German rapper-turned-IS recruiter. In February 2015, the US government labelled him a specially designated global terrorist. In one propaganda video he was seen holding a freshly decapitated human head. Greene, who worked at the FBI's Detroit field office, was tasked in January 2014 with investigating Cuspert, according to CNN. Six months later the German-speaking linguist travelled to Syria to marry him. Czechoslovakia-born Greene told her work superiors she was planning a trip to visit her parents in Germany. But instead she travelled to Turkey where she crossed the Syrian border with the help of local IS operatives, reports CNN. Greene was still married to a US serviceman at the time. Shortly after arriving in Syria in June 2014, she reportedly married Cuspert. He had dropped his stage name of Deso Dogg to call himself Abu Talha al-Almani. But Greene apparently soon had second thoughts about her new husband. According to CNN, she wrote to one unidentified person in the US: ""I really made a mess of things this time."" The next day she added: ""I am gone and I can't come back.  ""I am in a very harsh environment and I don't know how long I will last here, but it doesn't matter, it's all a little too late.""

She managed to escape the city and is now a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.  This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who are still inside the IS-held city.  She admitted to investigators that she had told Cuspert he was the target of an FBI investigation, reports CNN. It is unclear how she managed to flee the IS-held territory. Greene pleaded guilty in December 2014 to making false statements involving international terrorism. She served two years in a federal prison and was released last summer. Greene currently works as a hostess at a hotel at an undisclosed location. According to court documents obtained by CNN, prosecutors labelled her actions ""egregious"" and deserving of ""severe punishment"". But Greene's relatively lenient sentence was because of her ""significant, long-running and substantial"" co-operation with authorities, prosecutors said. Her lawyer, Shawn Moore, told CNN that Greene was ""smart, articulate and obviously naive"", adding that she was ""genuinely remorseful"".

"Syria war: Many dead in IS attack on displaced people's camp More than 30 civilians and Kurdish-led fighters have been killed in an attack by Islamic State (IS) militants near Syria's north-eastern border with Iraq. They targeted a makeshift camp for displaced Syrians and Iraqi refugees at Rajm al-Salibi, near the town of Shaddadi in Hassakeh province. The militants also clashed with members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stationed at a nearby checkpoint. IS said the attack was one of several targeting ""apostates"" around Shaddadi. The jihadist group is coming under mounting pressure in northern Syria from the SDF's Kurdish and Arab fighters, who are supported by the US, and from pro-government forces in neighbouring Iraq. The SDF has driven IS militants out of much of Hassakeh and is close to taking control of the strategically important Euphrates River Valley town of Tabqa. It will soon launch an offensive to retake the city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS after the fall of the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reports that at least five IS suicide bombers blew themselves up outside and inside the camp at Rajm al-Salibi, east of Shaddadi, at dawn on Tuesday. At least 38 people were killed by the bombings and subsequent clashes, among them 23 civilians, and 30 other people were wounded, it adds. According to Syria's official Sana news agency, more than 30 civilians were killed and 34 wounded. It did not say whether there had been any suicide bombings. The Kurdish Red Crescent put the civilian death toll at 22. SDF fighters took wounded civilians to hospitals in the city of Hassakeh. Several were admitted to intensive care due to the severity of their injuries, according to medical sources cited by Sana. An IS statement said six groups of militants had attacked SDF positions in Shaddadi and its surrounding area on Tuesday, including a ""barracks"" near Rajm al-Salibi, killing and wounding dozens of people. An Iraqi army source told the BBC the militants had also abducted dozens of civilians during the attack on the camp. It was not possible to verify the report. However, a similar allegation was made by the head of the Iraqi parliament's human rights committee in an interview with Beirut-based al-Mayadeen TV and Sana cited some of those injured as saying they had lost contact with dozens of their relatives. About 300 families were waiting at Rajm al-Salibi - where conditions are harsh and there is little shelter - to be screened and allowed to enter SDF territory.  They included Syrians from Raqqa and Deir al-Zour provinces, as well as some of the thousands of Iraqis who have fled to Syria from Mosul since October. As a result of the attack, approximately 400 people are being relocated from Rajm al-Salibi to another camp at al-Hawl.",Wednesday 03 May 2017,3-May-17,IS kills many in attack on Syrian camp,Many civilians are among more than 30 people killed in the incident near the Iraqi border.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39778171
"Jordan Edwards shooting: Texas police officer fired A Texas police department has sacked an officer who shot an unarmed black teenager in the back of the head at the weekend. Jordan Edwards, 15, died after Officer Roy Oliver fired a rifle into a car that was driving away from a party in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs. Police initially said the car reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredits that claim. Police Chief Jonathan Haber said he ""misspoke"". Officer Oliver was fired for violating several department policies, a police statement said, without providing further details. Lee Meritt, a lawyer for Jordan's family, said they want the officer arrested. They also want the other police on scene that night to be punished for their treatment of family members. The death occurred on Saturday night when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party where around 100 kids had gathered, neighbours said. Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots, causing panic at the home as people fled. Officer Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party, Chief Haber said after reviewing the body-cam video. The car was actually driving forward - away from police - and not reversing toward them when the shots were fired, he explained. Jordan, who was in the front passenger seat, died after being shot in the back of the head. ""I was unintentionally incorrect yesterday when I said that the victim's vehicle was backing down the road,"" Mr Haber said on Monday.  ""In fact, according to the video that I viewed, the vehicle was moving forward as the officers approached."" The officer's behaviour ""did not meet our core values"", the police chief added. Jordan's brothers, Vidal and Kevon, and two friends were detained at the scene and taken to the Dallas County Sheriff's Department, where they were held overnight and interviewed as witnesses. After the shooting, the boys ""were immediately treated as common criminals by other officers; manhandled, intimidated and arrested, while their brother lay dying in the front seat"", the family statement said. ""The officers who extended this nightmare for those children ought to be properly reprimanded,"" the Edwards family said. They added that they do not want protests to be held until after the funeral. ""Their young lives will forever be altered,"" the family statement said. ""No one, let alone young children, should witness such horrific, unexplainable, violence."" Mr Merrit told NBC News that Jordan's father was detained when he arrived at the police station and accused of ""hostile behaviour"". Jordan's cause of death has been ruled a homicide, however, that does not necessarily mean charges will be filed against the officer. The Dallas County Sheriff's Department and the Dallas County District Attorney's Office are conducting a criminal investigation. Jordan's coach, Jeff Fleener, told the Dallas Morning News that he was ""crushed and heartbroken"" to learn the first-year American football player at Mesquite High School had been killed.  ""You create a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend, and Jordan had all that. He was that kid,"" he said.",Wednesday 03 May 2017,3-May-17,Texas police change account of boy's death,"The car was driving away from officers, not ""aggressively"" towards them, as police initially said.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39783509
"Sweden ends ID checks on 'The Bridge' with Denmark Sweden is ending identity checks on border crossings with Denmark that were instituted early last year as thousands of migrants arrived seeking asylum. A major crossing point is the Oresund strait bridge between Malmo in Sweden and the Danish capital Copenhagen, made famous by TV series The Bridge. The checks have irritated commuters who travel daily between the two cities.  More than 163,000 asylum seekers arrived in Sweden in 2015 but that number fell to 29,000 last year. The falling number of arrivals means the checks on buses, trains and ferries are no longer necessary, the government says. But while ID checks at border points with Denmark are being scrapped, border controls elsewhere will continue to be tightened, it says. Interior Minister Anders Ygeman also said more surveillance cameras would be used on the Oresund bridge, in addition to vehicle x-rays. Meanwhile, the European Commission recommended that temporary border controls introduced in Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway during the migrant crisis be phased out in the next six months. ""The time has come to take the last concrete steps to gradually return to a normal functioning of the Schengen Area,"" EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told journalists, referring to the passport-free zone. In November 2015, Sweden began allowing police to check people entering Sweden from other states in Schengen. ""The government's conclusion is that border controls are still needed and need to be strengthened,"" Mr Ygeman was quoted as saying by The Local news website, hours before the EU Commission's announcement. The real story of 'The Bridge' The measure mandating identity checks on passengers travelling between Denmark and Sweden by bus, train and ferry was last extended in February and expires on 4 May, with the government to let it lapse, Swedish media report.

"As it happened: Le Pen-Macron debate And we'll keep you signed in. Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law. By Vicky Baker, Tom Spender, Patrick Jackson and Jasmine Taylor-Coleman All times stated are UK And that concludes our live coverage of one of the most memorable presidential debates in French history, astonishing in its passion, if not downright viciousness. Join us again on Sunday, election day itself, to see what verdict France passes on Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen.  The BBC's Thomas Fessy asks whether Le Pen will have convinced the undecided.  If you've been following our text updates, here is a video round-up of some of moments of the debate - with the candidates setting out their positions on the fight against terrorism and their visions for France. There's still more campaigning to be done, the BBC's Gavin Lee tweets. France 2 TV's Guillaume Daret asked people to make their judgement on Twitter. It's not an official poll, but of 676 votes cast at the time of writing, 60% give it to Macron, 24% say Le Pen and 16% say neither. ""We may have just watched the worst debate in the history of the 5th Republic,"" says French journalist Bruno Jeudy on BFMTV. If you've been keeping up with the frantic exchanges, you might want to slow the pace with two long reads from the BBC on the candidates:  ""I've rarely felt so much pleasure at hearing the word 'end',"" tweets a member of France's Left Party (Parti de Gauche). A cartoonist sums the debate up as both candidates each attempting to demonstrate their Gallic sang-froid by telling the other to calm down... The two candidates traded barbs right up until the end of the debate. Macron accused Le Pen of telling lies about his project without ever saying what she herself proposes. ""I refuse the spirit of defeat and hatred proposed by the National Front,"" he says. ""We've always been a generous and open country."" As the debate closed, Le Pen joked: ""Ha - like Francois Hollande."" Macron hit back. ""You stay on TV,"" he said. ""I want to lead the country."" And it's over! The actual vote will be on Sunday. It's all in the hands. ""People will say I am old-fashioned, but I like France
as it is, with its culture, its language, its borders."" She says Macron wants to shut down hospitals and factories.  ""The only thing you don’t want to close is the
borders."" In a soft voice, Macron brutally lays into Le Pen. ""The country is not important to you, you don't have a project. ""Your campaign of lies and falsification feeds off fear. It is fear that nourishes you. ""I don't want this for France - it is worth more than that. ""I understand the anger of our fellow citizens. I want to bring a deep response. ""I want a France that is reconciled with itself and one that is truly transformed."" The debate is running 10 minutes late already.The candidates are now summing up what they stand for.  In his two minutes of allotted time, Macron says he wants to pay more attention to France's overseas territories. He also wants to improve opportunities for disadvantaged people, particularly the young. ""I want pragmatic solutions,"" he says. ""The France that you defend isn't France, it's a trading room,"" she tells Macron, hinting at his past as an investment banker and economy minister. She says her vision of France is about solidarity, culture and hope.  ""France was thrown into chaos by your [political] friends,"" she says.  ""You are the far right. You spread lies on social media. You spread hatred. You molest journalists,"" he says. ""This is not what our France looks like."" The two candidates have each been given two minutes to talk about any issue they like as the debate draws to a close.  The candidates trade vicious barbs over probity.

"Theresa May accuses EU of trying to affect UK election Theresa May has accused European politicians of making ""threats"" against Britain to try to influence the general election result. The PM launched a stinging attack on the ""bureaucrats of Brussels"" in a speech outside 10 Downing Street after meeting the Queen. She said some in Brussels wanted Brexit talks to fail. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said she was ""playing party games with Brexit"" to try to win the general election. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""irresponsible"" of her to ""poison"" the atmosphere with the EU. A senior EU source told the BBC the PM's suggestion that officials were trying to affect the election result was ""pure fantasy"". Parliament was dissolved at midnight, meaning the election is formally under way, and the PM made her speech after visiting the Queen at Buckingham Palace. She said events of the past few days had shown ""just how tough"" Brexit talks are likely to be. ""Britain's negotiating position in Europe has been misrepresented in the continental press,"" she said, in a reference to a German newspaper's account of her dinner with the EU Commission chief. ""The European Commission's negotiating stance has hardened. Threats against Britain have been issued by European politicians and officials. ""All of these acts have been deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election that will take place on 8 June."" Mrs May said she wanted to reach a Brexit deal, and for the EU to succeed: ""But the events of the last few days have shown that - whatever our wishes, and however reasonable the positions of Europe's other leaders - there are some in Brussels who do not want these talks to succeed."" The PM also warned of ""serious"" consequences if the Brexit talks failed, which would be felt by ""ordinary, working people across the country"". ""If we don't get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen. ""If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children's children too. ""If we don't get the negotiation right, if we let the bureaucrats of Brussels run over us, we will lose the chance to build a fairer society with real opportunity for all."" She was criticised by Ms Sturgeon, who tweeted: ""UK needs best possible Brexit deal and has limited leverage, so for PM to poison atmosphere for partisan reasons is deeply irresponsible.... Having called election for reasons of party not national interest, PM now seems intent on fighting campaign in same way."" Mr Corbyn added: ""By winding up the public confrontation with Brussels, the prime minister wants to wrap the Conservative party in the union jack and distract attention from her government's economic failure and rundown of our public services.  ""But Brexit is too important to be used as a political game in this election."" Lib Dem Nick Clegg attacked her ""desperate, bizarre statement"", and UKIP's Patrick O'Flynn said millions of his party's voters remained worried the UK would leave the EU ""with the worst possible terms"". Analysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May just used one of the most powerful microphones in the country for blunt diplomacy indeed. It's worth pointing out she made careful aim at the EU institutions, rather than the individual leaders, with whom she'll have to deal one on one. But forget that nuance for a moment - this was quite some statement, quite an accusation to make. It seems the prime minister is intent on playing the Brexit card for all it's worth in the next election. Read more from Laura Mrs May's statement came during a day in which the UK's Brexit secretary and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had appeared at odds over the size of the ""Brexit bill"" the UK would owe when it left the European Union. The Financial Times claimed the likely bill had risen sharply from 60bn to 100bn euros, basing its calculations on new data from across Europe. Mr Barnier said there was no agreed figure but the UK and EU had entered into ""mutual commitments"" which must be honoured.  Mr Davis said the UK would pay what was legally due, in line with its rights and obligations, but ""not just what the EU wants"". On Tuesday, Mrs May told the BBC she would be a ""bloody difficult woman"" towards Mr Juncker during Brexit talks. Asked about her comment, Mr Juncker's chief of staff Martin Selmayr said: ""President Juncker said today that she is an impressive woman and that she is a very impressive negotiator."" He added: ""Brexit will never become a success, of course, because it is a sad and sorry event. But as I have set out, it can be managed in a professional and pragmatic way.""

"FBI head 'nauseous' over his possible sway on US election FBI Director James Comey has said it makes him ""mildly nauseous"" to think that he could have had an impact on the US presidential election. But Mr Comey said he thought concealing the discovery of new Hillary Clinton emails would have been ""catastrophic"". The comments came during a Senate panel on FBI oversight, in which Mr Comey faced tough questions about his inquiry into Mrs Clinton's private email use.  Mr Comey added that ""even in hindsight I would make the same decision"". Hillary Clinton joins the 'Trump resistance' Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake The remarks are the FBI chief's first public explanation of why he reopened an investigation into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server just days before last November's presidential election.  FBI Director James Comey said concealing the fact that his agency had reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server would have been ""catastrophic"".  What he didn't say was that the reason it would have been so damaging is that the news would have leaked even if he had kept silent. In those final weeks before the election, some in the FBI clearly thought the Clinton investigation was being handled poorly and were expressing their views - and sharing details - on background to the media. This is the ""catastrophic"" scenario Mr Comey probably envisioned:  He keeps mum, in keeping with FBI policy on investigations that could affect upcoming elections.  The story comes out despite his silence. Mrs Clinton wins, as appeared likely at the time based on polls and prognosticators. Then the contents of the emails reveal misdeeds by now president-elect Clinton. It's not a stretch to think Mr Comey would view such developments as threatening the ""death of the FBI"", in his words - an outcome that had to be avoided at all cost, even if it helped put Donald Trump in the White House. ""It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election,"" Mr Comey said on Wednesday. ""But, honestly, it wouldn't change the decision."" Mr Comey added that failing to inform Congress would have been an ""act of concealment"".  His testimony comes a day after Mrs Clinton once again blamed her surprise upset on Mr Comey's actions, as well as alleged meddling in the US election by Russian hackers.  Russian media no longer dazzled by Trump ""If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,"" she said in New York on Tuesday, referring to the day before Mr Comey notified Congress of the discovery of new emails.  ""I was on the way to winning until a combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and Russian Wikileaks raised doubts in the minds of people who were inclined to vote for me and got scared off.""  But President Donald Trump hit back online. ""FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!"" he tweeted.  ""The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?"" The FBI chief on Wednesday also revealed that Clinton emails containing classified information were forwarded to former congressman Anthony Weiner.  ""They found thousands of new emails. They found classified information on Anthony Weiner,"" he said while under questioning from Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein.  ""Somehow, her [Mrs Clinton's]  emails were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner, including classified information, by her assistant Huma Abedin.""  Mr Weiner, a New York Democrat, was married at the time to Ms Abedin, a top Clinton aide. He was separately under investigation for inappropriate communications with an under-age girl. Mr Comey also faced sharp questions in Wednesday's hearing about Russia's alleged role in tilting the election in favour of Mr Trump.  When asked whether the Kremlin was still meddling in American politics, Mr Comey responded: ""Yes"". ""I think one of the lessons that the Russians may have drawn from this is, 'this works',"" the FBI director said.  Senator Lindsey Graham, who is part of a Senate investigation into alleged Russian interference, pressed Mr Comey about what kind of threat Russia presents.  ""Certainly, in my view, the greatest threat of any nation on earth, given their intention and their capability,"" said the law enforcement chief.  In March, Mr Comey confirmed during testimony before a House of Representatives panel the FBI had opened an investigation into Russia's suspected interference in the presidential election. Democrats have criticised Mr Comey for not revealing the investigation before the election as he had with Mrs Clinton.  But the FBI head said he treated both inquiries ""consistently"".",Thursday 04 May 2017,4-May-17,FBI head 'nauseous' over election inquiry,But James Comey defends his decision to reveal a renewed probe into Hillary Clinton emails.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39795325
"US holding vital vote on Obamacare repeal The US House of Representatives is holding a vote on a revised healthcare bill that Republicans hope will replace Obamacare.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the party's leadership believed it had enough votes for the bill to pass, despite opposition from Democrats. It would then go to the Senate where it could run into more difficulties. President Donald Trump made the repeal of his predecessor's signature law a central campaign promise. Obamacare v Republican plan compared He has played a personal role this week in persuading wavering Republicans to support the legislation, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). In an effort to win votes of Republicans who were against the initial healthcare bill, Republicans amended it several times, trying to balance different demands. Several key Republicans then reversed course, partly due to an amendment by Congressman Fred Upton. It provides $8bn (£6.2bn) over five years towards coverage for sick people, including those with cancer, who could otherwise face higher costs under the new system.  But health policy experts say the amount is not enough to cover the cost of coverage for the sickest patients. The American Medical Association said millions of people would lose their coverage as a result of the proposal. ""None of the legislative tweaks under consideration changes the serious harm to patients and the health care delivery system"" that the bill could cause, the association's president, Andrew W Gurman said in a statement. Why is Obamacare suddenly so popular? Patients tell their Obamacare stories The bill has yet to be assessed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan group of budget analysts and economists, which typically provides an estimate on how much the bill would cost.  The CBO projected in late March that the previous version of the Republican healthcare bill would cut the federal deficits by $337bn (£275bn) over a 10-year period, but would also result in 14 million more Americans losing insurance in 2018.  No Democrats support the revision, and say the amount provided by the Upton amendment is inadequate.  Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said: ""The Upton amendment is like administering cough medicine to someone with stage four cancer."" That means the 216 votes necessary to pass the legislation will have to come from Republicans, who control both legislative chambers in Congress.  But internal differences remain, and they can afford only 22 defections. Reports suggest that 18 Republicans are likely to vote against the bill, and at least 33 are undecided or have no clear position. The vote will happen without an estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office of how many people will be left uninsured under the new plan and how much it will cost. In March, it said 24 million people would lose health insurance under the initial bill.  Trump health bill: Winners and losers The first attempt collapsed in disarray in March, with opposition from both moderates and conservatives inside the Republican party. They feared too many people with pre-existing medical conditions would be left unable to afford health coverage. President Barack Obama's overhaul of healthcare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans, but some have experienced rising premiums in recent years. One of its popular elements is that it bans insurers from denying coverage to patients who are ill with ""pre-existing conditions"". President Trump has insisted the revised bill will keep that, although it is thought that states will be able to opt out of making that an absolute provision. Conservatives want to see a complete rollback of Obamacare, while moderates are concerned about losing voters who like the existing law. Comedian Jimmy Kimmel made a heartfelt plea that pre-existing conditions be protected, and spoke about his newborn son who has a congenital heart defect, in a video that has been widely shared on social media. 100 voters reflect on Trump's 100 days The two faces of Trump's America The verdict on Trump so far",Thursday 04 May 2017,4-May-17,Momentum builds for Obamacare replacement,Republicans appear to have enough votes for their healthcare reform bill to clear its first hurdle.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39795676
"Woman convicted after disrupting Sessions hearing 'by laughing' Three members of the the Code Pink activist group have been convicted on charges of disrupting Attorney General Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearing.  Desiree Fairooz, one of the protesters who was found guilty, said all she did was laugh during the hearing.  Ms Fairooz, 61, was found guilty on two charges of disorderly conduct and parading or demonstrating on Capitol grounds. Each protester could face up to 12 months in prison.  Tighe Barry and Lenny Bianchi, who wore Ku Klux Klan (KKK) robes during the 10 January hearing, were also convicted on two separate charges of parading or demonstrating, according to US attorney spokesman Bill Miller. The two men were acquitted on charges of disrupting Congress. Ms Fairooz was removed and arrested after she interrupted Alabama Senator Richard Shelby during his opening statement at Mr Sessions' confirmation hearing to become America's top prosecutor.  The interruption came when Mr Shelby said that Mr Sessions' record of ""treating all Americans equally under the law is clear and well-documented"". Why protesters Code Pink stay out of jail Ms Fairooz ""let out aloud [sic] bursts of laughter, followed by a second louder burst of laughter"", according to a court document.  ""I just couldn't hold it,"" the Virginia resident said on Wednesday. ""It was spontaneous. It was an immediate rejection of what I considered an outright lie or pure ignorance."" Mr Sessions faced public scrutiny during his confirmation over allegations that he had once supported the KKK and other charges of racism. Ms Fairooz added she did not intend to disrupt the hearing and did not plan to get arrested.  ""We just wanted to be a visible symbol of dissent."" Code Pink campaign director Ariel Gold, who was sitting near Ms Fairooz, described the sound as a ""reflexive gasp"" that was ""quieter than a cough"". ""I would barely call it a laugh,"" she said.

"Baton Rouge police 'acted properly' in man's death Two police officers who shot and killed a man in Louisiana acted reasonably, the Department of Justice has said. The death of Alton Sterling outside a grocery shop in Baton Rouge last summer sparked days of protests at a time of heightened race tensions across the US. In confirming no charges would be brought against the police, the department said Mr Sterling was armed and refused to follow commands. The Sterling family said they were hopeful the state could bring a case. Louisiana's attorney general would have a ""phenomenal case"", the family lawyer said, because the officers' actions were ""outrageous, inappropriate and did not follow procedures"". ""Alton was human,"" said Sandra Sterling, Alton's aunt. ""He's no longer here but his voice still will be heard, through us. So stay behind Alton. And we don't want this to end. Remember his name."" Video footage of the struggle between the two white officers and the black man triggered days of protests and nearly 200 arrests in Baton Rouge. Moments after the family lawyer made his statement, the Department of Justice issued its justification for not bringing charges. In summary, it said: Whether Mr Sterling was reaching for his .38 caliber revolver is subject to debate because it is not clear from the video, and the Department of Justice could not say either way. ""The evidence simply cannot establish beyond a reasonable doubt the position of Sterling's right hand at the exact time of the shooting,"" the department said in its statement.

"Jimmy Prout 'forced to eat own testicle' in 'Dark Ages' abuse A vulnerable man died after months of torture including being forced to eat one of his testicles, a court heard. Jimmy Prout, 45, was subjected to months of ""Dark Ages"" abuse by a group he thought were his friends, the jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told. Ann Corbett, 26, Zahid Zaman, 43, Myra Wood, 50, and Kay Rayworth, 56, of North Shields, deny murder and allowing the death of a vulnerable adult.  The four pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. The jury heard the group had a strange relationship with Mr Prout that developed an almost ""cultish dimension"". However, it is alleged a series of events in late 2015 created tensions which led to serious assaults against the father-of-two, including knocking out his teeth. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said: ""Over a period of time, Jimmy Prout was not just mistreated, he was tortured. ""The defendants took part in that violence either inflicting injuries directly or assisting or encouraging the other members of the group to do so."" Mr Greaney said the evidence suggested Mr Prout died on 9 February 2016, and that his body was dumped on wasteland 100 metres from his home where it began to decompose and was partly eaten by animals. The group then allegedly tried to cover their tracks, asking people if they had seen Mr Prout while pretending to look for him.  The court heard how, on 25 March, police received a call from Mr Zaman in which he claimed Ms Corbett had attacked him and killed Mr Prout, in an attempt to ""throw her to the wolves"". On attending St Stephen's Way, North Tyneside, officers found Mr Zaman, Ms Rayworth and Ms Wood, who claimed to have letters written by Corbett confessing to the murder. Mr Greaney told jurors it was ""pure theatre"" and invention because they all knew Mr Prout had been dead for more than six weeks. He said Mr Prout was ""repeatedly assaulted and subjected to dreadful indignities"". ""They accept that Jimmy Prout was assaulted, but each of them wishes to reduce his or her own involvement in events, seeking to blame one or more of the others.

"Le Pen and Macron clash in crucial French election debate The two contenders for the French presidency traded insults in a fiery head to head TV debate, in a key moment of a long and bitter campaign. Centrist Emmanuel Macron said his far-right rival Marine Le Pen's strategy ""is to lie"", while she called him a shameless ""darling of the system"". Mr Macron is well ahead in the polls, although his lead has been reduced. The aim of both candidates is to win over the estimated 18% of undecided voters ahead of Sunday's election. For the first time, neither candidate is from a mainstream French party. Does Le Pen have a chance of winning French presidency? Macron's meteoric rise The debate was heated for most of its 160 minutes, with both candidates throwing personal insults at each other. Ms Le Pen called her 39-year-old rival ""the candidate of savage globalisation"", happy to sell off France's assets and relinquish control of the country.  Mr Macron, in turn, accused the 48-year-old leader of the National Front (FN) of being ""the high priestess of fear"", saying she talked a lot but ""proposed nothing"". On the economy and employment: Mr Macron admitted France had failed to tackle unemployment for 30 years, and said his solution would be to give small and medium-sized companies the opportunities to create more jobs and be more flexible. Ms Le Pen asked him why he could not have done these things while economy minister. She said she would protect state assets and French jobs by adopting protectionist trade measures. On terrorism: Ms Le Pen accused her rival of being complacent about Islamic fundamentalism, while he said her plans played into the hands of terrorists and their desire for a ""civil war"". Mr Macron said he would strengthen security measures already taken but insisted France needed to work with other countries, and closing borders and general expulsions were not the answer. The FN leader said Islamic fundamentalism needed to be ""eradicated"", and that meant shutting down extremist mosques, expelling preachers of hate and target funding from countries such as ""Qatar and Saudia Arabia"". The issues dividing Le Pen and Macron How do the French candidates differ on world affairs? French election 2017: The economic challenge On the EU and currency: Ms Le Pen said she wants not only full control of borders and trade agreements but also a ""return to our national currency, it's key"". She said banks and large companies could have a choice as to whether they paid in euros or a French currency, but individuals would return to a French currency. Mr Macron called the proposal ""nonsense"". ""How can a big company pay in euros on one hand and pay its employees in another currency?"" he asked. On education: Mr Macron said he would focus on improving standards in primary schools, and said he wanted to see closer links with business. Ms Le Pen said she wanted to see more vocational teaching, university criteria based on merit and more secularism in schools. This has got to go down as one of the great debates. The ones that people remember. From Marine Le Pen, the aggression of the demagogue, the venom, the constant niggling remarks designed to get under her adversary's skin. And from Emmanuel Macron, the Cartesian rationality of the brilliant French technocrat. There is not the slightest point of similarity between these two leaders. They are diametrical opposites. Their personalities clash; their politics clash; they loathe each other. It is a great service they are providing in this debate, because they are laying bare in all its stark newness the great division of our times: not between left and right, but between the nation and the world. It is a debate which echoes far beyond the borders of France, which is why this fiery confrontation will go down in the annals.

"Iran miners killed trying to save trapped colleagues The bodies of at least 21 miners trying to help colleagues trapped after an explosion in a coal mine in northern Iran have been recovered, state media has reported. A local official in the area said that nearly 70 people were injured. The officials said that those killed were miners in a tunnel trying to reach 32 miners trapped underground in the northern province of Golestan. The mine blast is thought to have been caused by a gas leak. Emergency crews are at work at the scene of the disaster, and have so far cleared about 600m (1,960ft) of the tunnel leading to the mine, officials say. But there has so far been no news about the condition of the trapped miners. They are believed to be at least 1,300m (4,265ft) underground at the Zemestan-Yurt mine, near Azadshahr. The men are said to have limited space and to be in danger from volatile gasses. Earlier reports said that at least 50 miners were buried by the blast. It remains unclear exactly how many miners are affected - with the authorities issuing different numbers throughout Wednesday. Two people were reported to have been killed earlier on Wednesday, with 25 others wounded by the blast. One emergency services spokesman said that 16 people had managed to escape. There are some reports that the gas explosion may have been caused by someone attempting to start a lorry engine.  President Hassan Rouhani meanwhile has been criticised by conservative rivals and the media for what they describe as his government's ""slow response"" to the disaster. He has sent Labour Minister Ali Rabei to the scene.  The incident could have political consequences for the government - coming less than a month before the 19 May presidential election in which Mr Rouhani is facing a strong challenge from conservative candidate Ebrahim Raisi. The rescue operation has reportedly been hampered by concerns about gas in the tunnels. Hamidreza Montazeri, deputy head of the provincial emergency services, told PressTV earlier on Wednesday that 25 people involved in the rescue had been taken for treatment after inhaling gas. State media reported that the mine employed some 500 workers and that the explosion - which took place at about 12:45 (09:45 GMT) - happened during a change of shift. Iran, which extracted 1.68 million tonnes of coal in 2016, mostly uses coal for domestic steel production rather than exporting it.",Thursday 04 May 2017,4-May-17,Iran mine rescue effort leaves 21 dead,Officials say those killed were trying to rescue 32 miners trapped underground in Golestan province.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39793108
"Facebook hires 3,000 to review content Facebook is hiring 3,000 people for its ""community operations team"", to help stop hate speech, child abuse and self-harm being broadcast on the website. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said it had been ""heartbreaking"" to see people ""hurting themselves and others"" in videos streamed live on Facebook. He added he would make reporting problematic videos easier. The move follows cases of murder and suicide being broadcast live on the social network. In April, a man was killed in a video streamed live on Facebook. Later in the same month, a Thai man killed his baby daughter and then himself in a live stream. Mr Zuckerberg said the additional staff, joining the 4,500 existing people on the community operations team, would help the company respond more quickly when content was reported. In a post on his Facebook profile, he said the company would develop new tools to manage the millions of content reports it received every week. ""We're going to make it simpler to report problems to us, faster for our reviewers to determine which posts violate our standards and easier for them to contact law enforcement if someone needs help,"" he said. The post suggested Facebook's moderators would contact law enforcement, rather than contacting members directly if they were at risk of harm. ""Just last week, we got a report that someone on Live [video] was considering suicide.

"Trump scores healthcare victory in House The US House of Representatives has passed a healthcare bill, bringing President Trump's pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare a stride closer. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed with a vote to spare, after weeks of cajoling within the Republican party to muster enough support. Democrats were unanimously opposed and their House leader Nancy Pelosi called it a ""cowardly choice"". President Trump predicted this ""great plan"" would now get Senate backing. ""Make no mistake, this is a repeal and a replace of Obamacare,"" he said from the Rose Garden at the White House, soon after the vote.   Its safe passage through the US lower chamber provides the new president with his first legislative victory, three months into his term. And it marks a remarkable turnaround after the bill was left for dead in March when Republicans were unable to agree on its provisions. But it was a close-run thing - Republicans needed 216 votes in the House and it passed with 217. No Democrats voted in favour. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Trump health bill: Winners and losers Five consequences of healthcare vote Round one of the battle over Obamacare repeal is in the books. Round two is set to begin, with the opponents more powerful and the obstacles more imposing.  It's worth remembering that passage of the Republican healthcare plan in the House of Representatives was supposed to be the easy part. House Speaker Paul Ryan had a sizeable majority at his disposal and the political tools to reward support and punish transgressions.  Instead the American Health Care Act's long, laborious journey exposed divisions within the Republican Party and the limits in Donald Trump's powers of persuasion. These challenges won't disappear. The fault lines will be put under greater pressure and Mr Trump's skills will be further tested when action heads to the Senate.  Unlike the House, the Republican majority there is narrow, and already some in the party are showing misgivings about the current legislation. Democrats, who have more parliamentary tricks up their sleeves, will attempt to disrupt the process at every turn. Still, a win is a win. It wasn't pretty. It may not last. But Mr Trump and the Republican House leadership will take it. But the speed at which it has been resuscitated since then, with several amendments aimed at winning over Republican rebels, has provoked criticism. It is not known how much the revised bill will cost, nor how many people will lose coverage, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not had time to assess it. Before the latest revisions, the CBO estimated 14 million more Americans would lose insurance in 2018 alone. Why is Obamacare suddenly so popular? Patients tell their Obamacare stories About 20 million Americans gained healthcare coverage under President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare. But Republicans viewed it as an overreach of the federal government and said patients had less choice and higher premiums. There were shouts of ""Shame on you!"" from protesters directed at congressmen and women as they left Capitol Hill. Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said: ""Very sad. One of the biggest transfers of wealth in the history of our country. Their desire to give a tax break for the rich just trumped everything."" But Republicans were jubilant.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the bill would give Americans greater choice and stop the current Obamacare ""death spiral"" of higher costs and fewer healthcare options.   The White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said it was a ""big win for Americans"" and would deliver expanded access and lower costs. Before the vote, the Republican leadership in the House played ""Eye of the Tiger"", the pre-fight song in Rocky, at a closed-door meeting. The bill goes to the Senate, probably next month, where it faces a precarious passage. Although the chamber is Republican controlled, their majority is a thin one and several of their senators said after the House victory they will write their own bill rather than amend that one. The influential Senator Bob Corker said the present bill had ""zero"" chance of clearing the upper chamber. Any new revisions made by the Senate would need approval from the House.",Friday 05 May 2017,5-May-17,Trump scores healthcare victory in House,The president's pledge to repeal Obamacare passes first hurdle by a squeak but now goes to Senate.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39809168
"Obamacare v Republican plan compared Republican politicians have campaigned on repealing President Barack Obama's healthcare reforms pretty much since they were enacted in 2010. Now, with a governing majority, they've had to come up with a replacement plan - a task that has proved much more challenging than they may have imagined. The latest bill, crafted by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, provides considerable discretion to individual states to craft their own healthcare systems, with financial support from the federal government.  Here's a look at some key differences between the existing law, informally known as Obamacare, and the Graham-Cassidy legislation. It is unlikely there will be government numbers on the impact before the bill comes to a vote. Obamacare: All Americans are required to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Republican plan: The mandate and penalty are repealed under the Senate plan.  Obamacare: Companies with more than 50 employees are required to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. Republican plan: The mandate and penalty are repealed. Five big consequences of Trumpcare win Obamacare: Raised Medicare taxes on the wealthy and imposed new taxes on medical devices, health insurers, drug companies, investment income, tanning salons and high-end health insurance plans. Republican plan: Maintains roughly 90% of Obamacare taxes, including the tax on high-income earners, but ends the 2.3% sales tax on medical devices. Obamacare: Requires insurers to allow children under age 26 to be covered by their parents' policies Republican plan: Maintains this requirement. Obamacare: Requires all insurance plans to cover certain health conditions and services, such as emergency room visits, maternity and postnatal care, cancer treatment, annual physical exams, prescription drug costs and mental health counselling. Republican plan: States may apply for waivers that allow them to end mandatory coverage of certain health conditions, such as vision and dental care for children, hospital care, and outpatient services. States that receive such waivers could allow insurers to set a maximum amount they will pay for an individual's medical services - a practice that Obamacare had prohibited. Obamacare: Prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging more to individuals who have pre-existing medical conditions. Republican plan: Gives states the ability to opt-out of requirements that insurers charge the same premiums for healthy and sick customers.  Obamacare: Expanded Medicaid health insurance for the poor to cover more low-income individuals. Republican plan: Starting in 2020 it distributes money the federal government currently spends on Medicaid to states in the form of ""block grants"" that are capped based on a state's population and whose growth is limited. The money could then be used for a variety of health-related programmes, and not just for expanding coverage or assisting individuals with insurance premiums. According to independent studies, 34 states would see reduced government support for Medicaid and tax subsidies for individual purchasing health insurance, dropping federal outlays on Medicare by $175bn from 2020 to 2026.  States that agreed to expand their Medicaid coverage under Obamacare would be hit the hardest, as their additional funding would be phased out. In 2027 all federal block-grant funding would have to be re-authorised by Congress or it would end. States could impose a work requirement for individuals on Medicaid, although the disabled and pregnant women would be exempted. Obamacare: Insurance companies prohibited from charging women more than men for the same health plan and must provide core services including maternity care and contraceptives. Republican plan: Insurance companies prohibited from charging women more for health insurance, but states could apply for waivers that allow them to drop coverage for maternity care and contraceptives. The bill also bans women from using government money to buy plans that covers abortion and ends non-abortion Medicaid reimbursement to Planned Parenthood, a non-profit group that provides abortion services in some of its clinics, for one year Obamacare: Insurers can charge older Americans no more than three times the cost for younger Americans  Republican plan: States can receive waivers to allow them to charge older Americans more. Obamacare: Provided refundable tax credits for low-income individuals who purchased their insurance on government-run marketplaces and support for some out-of-pocket medical expenses. Republican plan: Allows states to devise their own insurance subsidy plans. It expands the contribution limits on tax-free health savings accounts and allows individuals to use them for insurance premiums as well as out-of-pocket healthcare expenses and insurance co-payments.",Friday 05 May 2017,5-May-17,Obamacare v Republican plan compared,What is in the new Republican healthcare bill?

"Five big consequences of Trumpcare win Obamacare repeal lives to see another day, thanks to a concerted effort on the part of the White House and Republican leadership in Congress over the past few weeks. Passage of the American Health Care Act in the House of Representatives is just round one in a much longer battle, but there's no denying that Thursday's vote will have significant, lasting consequences. Here are five of them. A month and a half ago House Republicans tried to pass the original version of the American Health Care Act and had to pull it from consideration before a vote it appeared destined to lose. ""Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan lamented that day. ""And, well, we're feeling those growing pains today."" In the Oval Office, a chastened president spoke with reporters. ""We learned a lot about loyalty,"" he said. ""We learned a lot about the vote-getting process.""  The setback was cited as evidence of fissures within the Republican Party and an indication that Mr Trump wasn't the grand negotiator he imagined he was. It proved to be an open wound that the party couldn't get past.  Although the president said it was his intention to move on to tax reform, and Mr Ryan said Obamacare would be around ""for the foreseeable future"", the White House and congressional leaders continued to grind away at finding a compromise that would garner enough party support to pass.  In the end they found it - by first locking down the House Freedom Caucus conservatives and then peeling away enough moderates to put them over the top. Barely. It was all smiles in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon, however, as Mr Trump and Mr Ryan were able to put their first major legislative accomplishment on the board. With passage in the House of Representatives, the legislation now moves to the Senate, where it will face even greater challenges. While Mr Ryan had a large Republican majority in the House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two votes - and already some members of his party are expressing reservations. ""I don't support the House bill as currently constructed because I continue to have concerns that this bill does not do enough to protect Ohio's Medicaid Expansion population,"" Senator Rob Portman said in a press release."" Bloomberg News reported that several key Republican senators were already making plans to disregard the House bill and craft their own healthcare legislation from scratch. Coming up with a solution that satisfies both hard-liners and moderates will be a formidable task in the Senate, as it proved to be in the House. Democratic senators, who have considerable powers even in the minority, will disrupt the process whenever possible. It's a recipe for a political logjam that will be difficult to resolve. ""I know that our friends in the Senate are eager to get to work,"" Mr Ryan said at the White House celebratory event on Thursday.  The crowd of Republican politicians and staffers laughed. They know better. If the House bill as written were to become law it would send shockwaves through the US healthcare system, forcing insurance companies, medical providers and related companies to adjust to a new reality just years after Obamacare reforms had caused their own upheavals.  Medicaid, the health insurance programme for the poor, would see significant cuts. Government insurance mandates would be repealed. Taxes on wealthy individuals that paid for insurance subsidies for lower-income groups would be rescinded. States would be given greater discretion to do away with minimum levels of insurance coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, which analysed an earlier version of the legislation, more than 24 million more Americans would be uninsured under the American Health Care Act. Premiums would eventually drop around 10%. The federal budget deficit would go down by $150 billion over 10 years (although this number will surely change when the new version is scored next week).  Already the uncertainty is taking its toll. The last company participating in the Iowa individual insurance market may soon withdraw. Another major provider is pulling out of Virginia. In numerous states, the system for those who don't have insurance from the government or private employers is under significant strain. For a while it looked like the current Obamacare system would continue to muddle along intact, giving the healthcare industry some modicum of continuity. Instead the prospect of major change continues to loom on the horizon.  Given that the Senate will likely have its own, markedly different version of reforms soon, that uncertainty is only likely to grow. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Trump health bill: Winners and losers Following the successful passage of the American Health Care Act in the House, Democrats on the floor waved to their Republican colleagues and sang ""Hey, hey, hey, goodbye"". The moment recalled similar behaviour by Republican legislators in 1993, when they mocked Democrats for backing a sweeping tax increase in the early days of the Bill Clinton administration. The Democratic Party suffered a resounding defeat in the midterm elections of 1994, and Democrats believe this vote will have a similar devastating effect on their adversaries in the November 2018 elections.  What's certain is that Democratic candidates are going to do their best to paint the bill as a major tax cut for the rich, paid for with reduced benefits for the middle class and working poor. Already one Democrat running for governor in Virginia has cut a television advert condemning the bill, featuring an ambulance being slowly crushed in a compactor.  The nature of the House bill, which gives states considerable discretion in rolling back Obamacare, could also cast a spotlight on the 38 governor races in the next two years, as well as the battles for control of state legislatures.  Republicans currently have the upper hand across much of the US, but their majorities could be at risk if a Democratic electoral wave emerges.   Obamacare was the crown jewel of President Barack Obama's legislative achievements. Democrats paid a dear price at the ballot box for enacting the reforms, but it was a decades-long goal for the party that was viewed, by many, to be worth the sacrifice. ""This is a big effing deal,"" Vice-President Joe Biden memorably whispered to Mr Obama during the law's White House signing ceremony. Now that big deal is one step closer to being a relic of the past.  At the same time the Obamacare repeal bill moved on to the Senate, a House committee approved legislation rolling back Mr Obama's Wall Street financial reforms. Step by step, the Republican-controlled Congress may be taking an axe to everything the Democrats accomplished during Mr Obama's eight years in office. Environmental regulations are in the crosshairs, as is much of the tax-and-spending policy compromises Democrats and Republicans agreed on in 2013 Elections, as they say, have consequences.",Friday 05 May 2017,5-May-17,Five big consequences of Trumpcare win,Obamacare repeal takes a big step toward becoming law.

The scam claimed to come from Google Docs - a service that allows people to share and edit documents online. Users who clicked a link and followed instructions, risked giving the hackers access to their email accounts. Google said it had stopped the attack ""within approximately one hour"", including through ""removing fake pages and applications"". ""While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed,"" Google said in an updated statement. ""There's no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup.""  During the attack, users were sent a deceptive invitation to edit a Google Doc, with a subject line stating a contact ""has shared a document on Google Docs with you"".  The email address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator[.]com was also copied in to the message; Mailinator, a free email service provider has denied any involvement.   If users clicked on the ""Open in Docs"" button in the email, they were then taken to a real Google-hosted page and asked to allow a seemingly real service, called ""Google Docs"", to access their email account data. By granting permission, users unwittingly allowed hackers to potentially access to their email account, contacts and online documents.  The malware then e-mailed everyone in the victim's contacts list in order to spread itself. ""This is a very serious situation for anybody who is infected because the victims have their accounts controlled by a malicious party,"" Justin Cappos, a cyber security professor at NYU, told Reuters. According to PC World magazine, the scam was more sophisticated than typical phishing attacks, whereby people trick people into handing over their personal information by posing as a reputable company.  This is because the hackers bypassed the need to steal people's login credentials and instead built a third-party app that used Google processes to gain account access. The Russian hacking group Fancy Bear has been accused of using similar attack methods, but one security expert doubted their involvement.  ""I don't believe they are behind this... because this is way too widespread,"" Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, told PC World.  Google said the spam campaign affected ""fewer than 0.1%"" of Gmail users. That works out to about one million people affected.

"Rescued surfer Matthew Bryce had 'prepared for death' A rescued surfer told his family he had ""made himself at peace"" with not surviving after 32 hours adrift at sea. Matthew Bryce, from Airdrie in North Lanarkshire, was found 13 miles off the Argyll coast on Monday night after going surfing on Sunday morning. From his hospital bed in Belfast, he said he watched the sun set, believing he would not survive another night. His parents John and Isabella described their anguish as they waited for news. The 23-year-old told BBC Scotland's Jackie Bird how it had started as ""just a normal day"". He said he had driven to Westport car park in the Kintyre peninsula on Sunday morning, waxed his surfboard then gone into the sea about 11:00 to catch some waves. The day soon turned into a nightmare and he began to panic as tides and winds carried him out to sea. ""The wind and water was just relentless,"" he said. At one point he got back to within about a mile of land, only for the tide to change direction. ""It got to the point where my paddling was ineffective, but I was doing it to keep myself warm."" If he had been surfing he said he might have stayed in the water for about four hours, but now the sun was setting and he was carried further out to sea. Mr Bryce said his hopes were raised when he saw fishing boats, but his shouts went unheard and they sailed off. He described how deep fear set in when night fell. ""It was incredibly lonely and quiet because there was just nothing - just waves,"" he said. ""I hadn't seen any helicopters. ""I was thinking I was going to die - I was almost convinced. ""I didn't think I would see sunrise."" Mr Bryce said he then saw ships, and since he was well out of the coastguard search area, he decided to try and get into a shipping lane in the hope someone might see him. He continued to paddle towards the ships through the night. By daylight he was starting to pass out and fall off his board. He continued to drift through the day and as night approached again he said he was resigned for death. ""I knew I wasn't going to make another night, so I was watching the sunset,"" he said. ""Then a helicopter flew over me."" Terrified that he wouldn't be spotted he jumped off his board and held it above him and started waving it. After thinking they had missed him, he described the moment his luck changed. ""But then they turned round and when I saw them turn it was indescribable,"" he said. ""I can't describe it at all. ""These guys were the most beautiful sight I had ever seen. ""I owe them my life."" He was winched from the North Channel by the search and rescue helicopter at about 19:30 on Monday. Police Scotland and the coastguard had launched a large-scale search earlier that day, including rescue teams from Campbeltown, Southend, Gigha, Tarbert and Port Ellen. During the day of the coastguard search, his parents John and Isabella, who are both nurses, were with their eldest son at their caravan near Campbeltown. Mrs Bryce said she spent the day looking at the water praying her son would be found alive. Mr Bryce said while he had tried not to give up hope, he had started discussing with his brother-in-law, the process of who would go to identify his son's body when it was found. He said: ""We tried to keep strong, but it was just getting harder and harder."" Describing the moment his phone rang, he said: ""I walked outside the caravan because I think it's the worst news possible. ""It was the police inspector and all he said was 'he was found alive'. ""I was outside crying my eyes out and obviously Isabella and my son thought we'd received the worst possible news. ""So I had to run in and tell them 'he's alive, he's talking to the coastguard'."" About half an hour later they were able to speak to their son on the phone. Matthew said he owed his life to the coastguard, RNLI, the police and the staff at Ulster Hospital. ""They are all heroes,"" he said. He added that he would not be surfing again.

"Pair killed neighbour over child's burst football A father and daughter who launched a fatal attack on a neighbour who punctured a child's football have been convicted of manslaughter. Kelly Machin, 34, had been fed up with balls landing in her back garden in Leicester, so she burst one before throwing it back over the fence. The child's mother and grandfather assaulted her and she died almost two weeks later. A jury found both Natalie Bollen and William Jelly guilty of manslaughter. William Harbage, prosecuting at Leicester Crown Court, said Ms Machin had been having problems with Bollen, who lived two doors down in Waldwick Close, for several months. She was concerned about the excessive noise made by Bollen's children, and bothered by them regularly kicking balls into her garden. On the day of the assault, 23 August 2016, she punctured one of the balls with a knife. A group of women, with Bollen described as the ""ringleader"", then gathered outside Ms Machin's home shouting ""Come out Kelly"", the court heard. Bollen banged on her door, swearing and shouting: ""You might not come out now Kelly, but I'm gonna kill ya."" Ms Machin called 999 and told police that she was scared for her life. The group of women went away but Bollen returned about 20 minutes later with her father, and her father's wife. A friend of Ms Machin, Winston Hinds, answered the door and the defendants ""barged their way into the house uninvited"", the court was told. Natalie Bollen punched Ms Machin about three times to the head, and William Jelly then punched or pushed her, causing her to fall over and crash into a coffee table, fracturing her ribs. ""When she was on the floor, the defendants then left her curled up on the floor crying, and holding her ribs,"" said Mr Harbage. Ms Machin called emergency services while the defendants were still in the house and in the 999 call she can be heard crying out in pain and saying: ""They smashed my head up."" Both defendants can also be heard shouting aggressively to Ms Machin before they leave. Police and paramedics attended but it was not felt necessary for her to go to hospital. She continued experiencing severe pain and was eventually taken to hospital on 28 August, but her injuries were regarded as not requiring emergency treatment.  However, the rib fractures caused 1.9 litres of blood to gradually accumulate around her heart, which stopped working. Mr Harbage said she died ""alone and in pain, with significant breathing difficulties"" at her home on the weekend of 3 and 4 September. Mr Hinds found her dead on the sofa when he went to her house on 5 September. Jelly, 48, from Impey Close in Thorpe Astley, was not in the dock for the verdicts as he collapsed in court earlier and was taken to hospital.

An Ontario judge dismissed mischief charges against Anita Krajnc, ending a legal battle that captured the global attention of animal rights activists.  Judge David Harris said he was not convinced that Ms Krajnc obstructed the use of property when she gave water to pigs headed to slaughter.  Ms Krajnc said it confirms ""compassion is not a crime"".  Mischief to property is a criminal offence in Canada related to the wilful destruction or damage of property.   Justice Harris wrote in his decision that he is satisfied that Ms Krajnc ""did not obstruct, interrupt or interfere with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of any property"" when in July 2015, she gave water to a few animals being carried in a tractor trailer filled with 190 pigs going to a slaughterhouse outside Toronto.  Ms Krajnc, who co-founded an organisation called Toronto Pig Save in 2011, regularly gathered with other activists on a traffic island at an intersection near a large slaughterhouse to pet the animals and give them water.  But this time, the truck driver confronted Ms Krajnc and police were called. A video of the tense encounter was posted online by the activists.  During her trial, supporters crammed into the courtroom, many sitting on the floor. Members of the media sat in the prisoner's box.  Despite her win on Thursday, Ms Krajnc told the BBC she has ""mixed feelings"" about the decision.  ""We were hoping for recognition in the legal system that pigs and other animals are simply not property - that they are sentient beings, that they have basic rights,"" she said.  In his decision, Justice Harris noted that under Canadian law, pigs are property.  ""Ms Krajnc and like-minded individuals may believe otherwise and they are fully entitled to that belief. That does not however make it so,"" he wrote.  Ms Krajnc's case and her efforts to ""hold vigil"" for animals headed to slaughter have caught on with animal rights activists around the world.  A number of similar ""Save"" campaigns have cropped up globally, including dozens in the UK. The movement promotes veganism, animal rights activism, and ""bearing witness"" to the suffering of animals.  Jenny Canham helped create the Essex Pig save chapter and told the BBC she was ""really relieved"" by Thursday's court decision.  She said her group will continue to advocate for animal welfare and to spread the movement in the UK.  Ms Krajnc said she will continue to organise ""vigils"" near slaughterhouses.

"'Unlock iPhone', says judge in US sextortion case A Florida judge has ruled that two defendants in a sextortion case must hand over the passwords to their mobile phones so officials can search them.  Reality TV star Hencha Voigt and former boyfriend, Wesley Victor, are accused of threatening to release explicit images of social media star Julieanna Goddard unless she paid a ransom.  The defendants said the ruling broke their constitutional rights.  But Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Charles Johnson said he was following the law. ""For me, this is like turning over a key to a safety deposit box,"" he said on Wednesday. Prosecutors allege that Ms Voigt and Mr Victor told Ms Goddard to pay them $18,000 (£14,000) within 24 hours, or they would release X-rated videos and photos of her. Ms Goddard, a party promoter and socialite, is a big name on social media where she goes by the name ""YesJulz"".   Ms Voigt is a model and Instagram star who appeared in WAGS Miami, a reality TV show about the wives and girlfriends of sports figures. Police arrested the defendants last July and seized their phones, having intercepted text messages allegedly sent to Ms Goddard.  But they have been unable to bypass the passwords for Ms Voigt's iPhone and Mr Victor's BlackBerry to search for more evidence.  As a result, prosecutors formally asked the court to order the defendants to reveal their passwords. Lawyers for the defendants said this would violate the Fifth Amendment - the part of US law that means people can not be forced to incriminate themselves.  But prosecutors cited a December court decision that allowed Florida police to force a suspected voyeur to give up his iPhone password. On Wednesday, Judge Johnson ruled that he had no choice but to follow precedent. ""That's the law in Florida at this point,"" he said. Ms Voigt and Mr Victor have two weeks to comply with the order, or they could be jailed for contempt of court. They have both pleaded not guilty to charges of extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion and unlawful use of a communication device.  The issue of whether authorities should have the right to access defendants' phones has sparked controversy recently. Last year, the US Department of Justice ordered Apple to help unlock the phone used by San Bernardino gunman Rizwan Farook. But Apple fought the order, saying it would set a ""dangerous precedent"". An apparent reported spike in demands by border officials to search visitors' phones when they arrive in the US also made headlines.  Department of Homeland Security data analysed by NBC News found that agents looked through almost 25,000 phones in 2016.",Friday 05 May 2017,5-May-17,"'Unlock iPhone', says judge in sex case",A reality TV star accused of extortion may face jail if she does not give officials access to her phone.,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39804358
"French election: Macron takes action over offshore claims The frontrunner in the race for the French presidency, Emmanuel Macron, has filed a lawsuit over online rumours that he has a secret bank account in the Caribbean. Prosecutors in Paris have opened an investigation following his complaint. The news came after the centrist, pro-EU candidate was regarded as having come out on top in the final TV debate ahead of Sunday's run-off vote. His far-right adversary, Marine Le Pen, referred to the claims in the debate. He replied: ""That is defamation."" On Thursday, an aide to Mr Macron told AFP news agency: ""We will not hesitate to prosecute for defamation anyone who repeats this false information."" The prosecutors' investigation sends a clear message that anyone repeating the allegation can expect to be taken to court, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says. The allegations about a secret bank account spread online on right-wing websites and on social media. Speaking on French radio on Thursday, Mr Macron called the allegations ""fake news and lies"" and said some of the sites spreading them were ""linked to Russian interests"". His supporters say some of the sites have supported US President Donald Trump. Mr Macron's team has published a blow-by-blow account purporting to show how the allegations were spread online just two hours before the debate in an attempt to damage their candidate.  They say this included the production of fake documents to give the appearance of tax evasion and a clumsy forgery of his signature.  In other developments on Thursday: Le Pen: ""I hope we won't find out that you have an offshore account in the Bahamas. I hope so..."" Macron: ""No, Madame Le Pen, because that's defamation."" Le Pen: ""No, no, I said 'I hope'."" Macron: ""But what about you? We all know about your undervalued assets and we all know that you're currently under legal action - that's not my situation, that's yours."" He was referring to alleged fraudulent payments from the European Parliament to the FN's party staff. The FN denies allegations that it took payments for staff who were not really working for MEPs, and Ms Le Pen says she is the victim of a politically-motivated vendetta. Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen argued for two hours in the hope of winning over voters. She lambasted him on his record as economy minister in the Socialist government - a post he quit to form his En Marche! movement - and accused him of being ""the candidate of savage globalisation"". In turn, Mr Macron said Ms Le Pen had openly lied, proposed nothing and exaggerated the concerns of the public.  Ms Le Pen accused him of complacency about the threat of radical Islamist terrorism. In response, Mr Macron said the measures she proposed - ""eradicating"" Islamic fundamentalism by shutting down extremist mosques, and expelling preachers of hate - were ""snake oil"" that played into terrorists' hands and the desire they had for a ""civil war"". Both candidates were hoping to make an impression on the estimated 17% of undecided voters in the first election the country has ever held without a candidate from the two traditional mainstream parties. BFMTV carried a poll suggesting viewers of the debate had a more favourable view of Mr Macron than Ms Le Pen in most categories. He was the ""most convincing"" of the pair in the opinion of 63% of those interviewed. The BFMTV poll was carried out among 1,314 people over the age of 18 who had watched the television debate. French newspapers were taken aback by the open hostility on display during Wednesday night's debate. Le Figaro saw Ms Le Pen adopt a ""strategy of total war that consisted of bombarding her opponent without respite"". Mr Macron, it says, ""dominated his opponent on economic issues"" during a debate of ""unprecedented brutality"". Liberation accuses Ms Le Pen of ""drowning the debate in an avalanche of disinformation"" and publishes a list of what it says are false or exaggerated statements made by her. Le Monde also firmly comes down on the side of Mr Macron, who it says ""repeatedly denounced the 'nonsense' by the candidate of the National Front - often rightly"". Les Echos takes issue with the aggressive tone of the debate, saying the candidates ""spent more time attacking each other"" than explaining future reforms.

"Trump to visit Israel, Vatican and Saudi Arabia in first foreign trip Donald Trump has said he will visit Israel, the Vatican and Saudi Arabia in his first foreign trip as US president. Mr Trump will travel overseas in late May before heading to Brussels for a Nato meeting and a G7 summit in Sicily. The news comes a day after Mr Trump hosted Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas at the White House, where he promised to facilitate a peace deal with Israel.  The trip is meant to signify Mr Trump's tour of capitals of three major monotheistic religions. ""Tolerance is the cornerstone of peace,"" Mr Trump said on Thursday in a National Day of Prayer address to religious leaders in the White House Rose Garden. ""That is why I am proud to make a major and historic announcement this morning and share with you that my first foreign trip as president will be to Saudi Arabia, then Israel, then the Vatican in Rome."" The announcement came the same day as Mr Trump signed an executive order to ease a ban on political endorsements by churches and religious groups.  How much has the president achieved so far? What's in Trump's religious liberty order? Seven ways the world has changed under Trump With visits planned to Saudi Arabia and Israel, including a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Donald Trump is plunging feet-first into the swirling waters of Middle East politics, where US presidents dating back to Harry Truman have struggled to stay afloat. He thinks he's up to the task. ""It's something that I think is, frankly, maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years,"" he said of Arab-Israeli negotiations during a White House meeting with Mr Abbas on Wednesday. The trip could also allow the president to burnish his appeal to US political constituencies, including Jewish and evangelical voters with his Israel stop, and Catholics through his planned audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican. During the Republican presidential primary campaign, Mr Trump accused the pontiff of questioning his faith, which he called ""disgraceful"". Foreign trips can often prove a challenge for even the most experienced politician - fraught with diplomatic pitfalls and unintended consequences. Mr Trump, with his propensity for damaging off-script comments and actions, could have opted for a less challenging destination for his first trip abroad.  Instead, he will sink or swim. Mr Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in February and met Saudi Arabia's powerful Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in March in Washington.  But the president has previously clashed with Pope Francis over his anti-immigration rhetoric during the presidential campaign.  During a visit to Mexico, the pontiff said of Mr Trump: ""A person who thinks only about building walls... and not building bridges, is not Christian."" Mr Trump called the pope's remarks ""disgraceful"", but later walked back his comments, saying the Pope was ""misinformed"".  But the two appeared to make amends after Mr Trump was elected, when Pope Francis sent him a letter wishing him well.  He told the newly inaugurated president he prayed ""that your decisions will be guided by the rich spiritual and ethical values that have shaped the history of the American people and your nation's commitment to the advancement of human dignity and freedom worldwide"". Mr Trump will conclude his first foreign swing abroad with a Nato meeting in Belgium on 25 May and a stop in Sicily for the G7 summit the following day.  The president, who campaigned on an ""America First"" platform, has avoided travel abroad in his first months in office.

"Syria: Rebels storm out as 'safe zones' plan signed Three countries backing different sides in Syria's war have agreed to set up ""safe zones"" in the country, while delegates for rebel forces stormed out in protest. Russia's plan for ""de-escalation"" zones was backed by Iran at talks in Kazakhstan. Both countries support Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Turkey, which supports rebel groups, also agreed to act as a guarantor.  But some delegates from the rebel forces angrily rejected the plan. As the three countries were invited to sign the document on Thursday in the Kazakh capital, Astana, rebel delegates angrily shouted that they did not accept it and walked out.  Reporters at the talks said the rebels were unhappy about Iran's involvement in the deal as a guarantor.  The US also expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had ""only contributed to the violence, not stopped it"". The Syrian government is not a signatory, but its state news agency said it supported the plan. The talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Under the Russian plan, safe zones would be established in rebel-held territory in the north-western province of Idlib, in parts of Homs province in the centre, in the south, and in the opposition enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, the AFP news agency reported. Syrian and Russian warplanes would stop bombing rebel positions while opposition groups would halt attacks inside the ""de-escalation zones"". The objective is to ""put an immediate end to the violence"" and ""provide the conditions for the safe, voluntary return of refugees"" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The safe zones would remain in place for six months, the Kremlin has said. They would be surrounded by checkpoints manned by rebels and government troops, and foreign troops could also be deployed in observer roles, according to AFP. The UN's envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called the agreement a step in the right direction. Syria's envoy to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari said he hoped Russia and Iran would discuss the plan's details with the Syrian government as soon as possible.

"French election: Emmanuel Macron condemns 'massive' hack attack The campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron says it has been the target of a ""massive hacking attack"" after a trove of documents was released online. The campaign said that genuine files were mixed up with fake ones in order to confuse people. It said it was clear that hackers wanted to undermine Mr Macron ahead of Sunday's second round vote. The centrist will face off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The documents were leaked on a file sharing website late on Friday and the Macron camp condemned the action just before the official campaigning period ended at midnight (22:00 GMT). Candidates and the media now face restrictions until the polls close on Sunday evening, meaning Mr Macron cannot issue further statements. Opinion polls had indicated the former economy minister carried a lead of 20 percentage points or more over Ms Le Pen, the National Front candidate. Separately it was reported that socialist legislator Corinne Erhel, 50, collapsed while speaking at a rally for Mr Macron in Plouisy, western France, on Friday and later died. About nine gigabytes of data were posted online by an anonymous user. Mr Macron's En Marche movement said internal campaign documents, including emails and financial data, had been taken in an ""act of massive, co-ordinated hacking"". ""The leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement,"" it said in a statement.  The campaign said the documents showed only legitimate campaign activities. France's election commission warned that publication or republication of the leaked information could be a criminal offence. The hashtag #MacronLeaks appeared on Twitter on an account used by a US alt-right figure on Friday afternoon - and was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting the use of automated bots to spread the information faster. Within 90 minutes, the information had caught the attention of prominent supporters of Marine Le Pen and was further spread by bots. Some three-and-a-half hours after the initial tweet, #MacronLeaks had been used some 47,000 times and the prominent Wikileaks account played a key role in publicising the hashtag. That too remains unclear. The Macron camp has not blamed any specific party but said the hack clearly aimed to damage it and undermine French democracy, It compared it to the leak of Democratic Party emails in last year's US presidential election that was blamed on Russian hackers. Wikileaks, which published those emails, posted a link to the Macron documents on Twitter but implied it was not responsible. Mr Macron's team has already been the victim of hacking attacks, for which it has blamed groups based in Russia and Ukraine. It suspects the Kremlin of wanting to help Ms Le Pen, who supports a pro-Moscow foreign policy. Russia has denied that it is behind attacks aimed at Mr Macron. On Thursday, the centrist candidate filed a lawsuit over online rumours that he had a secret bank account in the Caribbean. Mr Macron called the allegations ""fake news and lies"" and said some of the sites spreading them were ""linked to Russian interests"". France's voters have rejected the two big political parties - the Socialists and the Republicans - that have governed for decades. Voters will be making a decision on France's future direction and on its place at the heart of the European Union.  If they opt for liberal Emmanuel Macron, they will be backing a candidate who seeks EU reform as well as deeper European integration, in the form of a eurozone budget and eurozone finance ministers.  If instead they choose far-right Marine Le Pen she promises quite the opposite. She wants a Europe of nations to replace the EU. After the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of US President Donald Trump, France is the latest country to deal a blow to politics as usual. One of the overriding issues facing French voters is unemployment, which stands at almost 10% and is the eighth highest among the 28 EU member states. One in four under-25s is unemployed. The French economy has made a slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and all the leading candidates say deep changes are needed.  Economic challenges facing next president Marine Le Pen wants the pension age cut to 60 and to ""renationalise French debt"", which she argues is largely held by foreigners. Emmanuel Macron wants to cut 120,000 public-sector jobs, reduce public spending by €60bn (£50bn; $65bn), plough billions into investment and reduce unemployment to below 7%. What the two candidates want The election is taking place amid a state of emergency, and the first round took place three days after a policeman was shot dead on the Champs Elysées in the heart of Paris. Some 50,000 police will be deployed across the country along with 7,000 troops involved in the anti-terror operation begun after the January 2015 Paris attacks, according to French media.  More than 12,000 police and military will be on alert in the Paris area. The security forces will primarily guard polling stations and will be organised into ""dynamic patrols"" set to intervene immediately in any incident, Le Figaro newspaper reported. More than 230 people have died in terror attacks since January 2015 and officials fear more of the hundreds of young French Muslims who travelled to Syria and Iraq may return to commit new atrocities. Intelligence services believe attackers are deliberately pursuing a Le Pen victory, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris - because that could tip the country into chaos. Ms Le Pen wants to suspend the EU's open-border agreement on France's frontiers and expel foreigners who are on the watch lists of intelligence services.  Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen came top of the 11 candidates in total who participated in the first round of voting on 23 April. While the outcome of Sunday's second round should be clear that evening, the results will be officially proclaimed by France's constitutional council on Thursday, 11 May. %  Emmanuel  Macron  %  Marine  Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart.

"Canada considers retaliation for US tariff on softwood lumber Canada is considering multiple trade actions against the US in response to tariffs on softwood lumber.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday he was considering banning US coal exports in response to the ""unfair"" tax on Canadian lumber. The government is also looking at duties against several Oregon industries, the BBC has learnt. Oregon has been one of the loudest supporters of an up to 24% tax on Canadian softwood lumber. Mr Trudeau wrote to British Columbia (BC) premier Christy Clark to say that he was ""carefully and seriously"" considering trade action on coal exports. He said trade officials will explore next steps. Ms Clark had previously asked Ottawa to ban US thermal coal exports, and has said she will impose a tax on thermal coal entering BC ports regardless of the federal government's decision, because ""it is the right thing to do"". BC is one of Canada's largest producers of softwood lumber. ""We share the commitment to fighting climate change and protecting the environment,"" Mr Trudeau wrote in his letter on Friday. ""We strongly disagree with the US Department of Commerce's decision to impose an unfair and punitive duty on Canadian softwood lumber."" The government is also considering imposing duties or other trade action on several Oregon industries, the BBC has learnt.  This has nothing to do with US President Donald Trump, who has been a vocal opponent of Nafta and criticised Canada for protectionist dairy policies, the BBC is told. Instead, the government is considering levying duties on several Oregon industries, including wine, wood chips, plywood, flooring and packaging material, that receive state support which the Canadian government believes may constitute illegal subsidies. Democratic Oregon senator Ron Wyden is one of the biggest critics of the Canadian softwood lumber industry. Canada and the US have long had a trade dispute over softwood lumber, with the US arguing that Canada unfairly subsidises its industry by charging minimal fees to log publicly owned lands. Last week, the US Commerce Department announced it will charge five Canadian softwood exporters duties ranging between 3.2% to 24.12% to make it a ""level playing field"".",Saturday 06 May 2017,6-May-17,Canada-US trade tensions escalate,Trudeau considers banning US coal exports and imposing duties on Oregon industries.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39826013
"Trump's Army Secretary nominee Mark Green withdraws President Donald Trump's pick for Army Secretary has withdrawn his nomination amid backlash over his past controversial remarks.  Mark Green said his nomination had become a distraction due to ""false and misleading attacks"" against him. The president's second pick for the post has outraged Democrats and some Republicans after his comments about the LGBT community were revealed. The Tennessee state senator said last year ""transgender is a disease"".  ""If you poll the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease,"" he told a Tea Party group last September in Chattanooga.  Three years earlier, Mr Green criticised former President Barack Obama for supporting what he described as ""transvestites in uniform"".  ""Tragically, my life of public service and my Christian beliefs have been mischaracterised and attacked by a few on the other side of the aisle for political gain,"" the senator said in a statement.  Trump's cabinet: The people around the president How much has the president achieved so far? ""While these false attacks have no bearing on the needs of the Army or my qualifications to serve, I believe it is critical to give the president the ability to move forward with his vision to restore our military to its rightful place in the world."" Mr Green, who served as an Army flight surgeon, drew criticism from gay-rights advocacy groups including the American Military Partner Association.  He sponsored legislation that would allow mental health practitioners to refuse to treat LGBT patients and supported a bill that would have forced transgender students to use toilets that matched the sex listed on their birth certificate.  He also faced criticisms from the Muslim Advocates and the Council on American-Islamic Relations for comments he made that both groups considered discriminatory against those who follow the Islamic faith.  US Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran and Illinois Democrat, tweeted after the announcement that while she respects his service, ""he is not fit to lead the Army & made the right decision"" to withdraw.  Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he found some of Mr Green's comments ""very concerning"".  But 11 Republican lawmakers signed a letter supporting Mr Green's ""long record of distinguished accomplishments in the defence of the nation"". Mr Trump's previous nominee for the position, billionaire Vincent Viola, withdrew his nomination in February, saying he could not divest himself from his business interests.  Mr Green, who was re-elected for a second term in November, had earlier announced a Republican run for governor of Tennessee. He dropped his bid once he was nominated for Army Secretary on 7 April.

"Somalia conflict: US suffers rare combat loss in al-Shabab clash A member of the US military has been killed in Somalia, the first confirmed US combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. This happened on Thursday during operations against al-Shabab militants about 64km (40 miles) west of the capital Mogadishu, near the town of Barii, the US military says. Two other US service members were hurt. US forces were on an ""advise and assist"" mission with the Somali National Army, the US military says. American presidents have been wary of intervention in Somalia since 18 special forces soldiers died fighting militias in Mogadishu in 1993, a battle dramatised in the film Black Hawk Down. However, President Donald Trump has expanded military action against the al-Qaeda affiliate in the Horn of Africa nation. The situation in Iraq made US boots on the ground abroad a touchy subject but this sensitivity is even worse when the foreign soil is in Somalia. Memories of the disastrous Black Hawk Down in 1993 are still vivid in Washington. The preferred approach today is to enable local forces to provide their own security. The US has been providing training and advice to Somalia's special forces. This elite local group is expected to lead the fight against al-Shabab militants. For now, some of their operations are carried out with their US advisers alongside. The wider Somali National Army has also been receiving US support. Last month dozens of American troops arrived in the country to train them. The UK and Turkey are also playing a similar role in this larger and more challenging task of building a sustainable Somali army. US Africa Command spokeswoman Robyn Mack said the American ""service member"" had been struck by small arms fire. Two other members of the US military wounded in the same incident were receiving ""proper medical attention"", she added. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a US Navy Seal had been killed, Reuters news agency reports.  In Thursday's mission, US troops were hunting an al-Shabab commander near the Shabelle river, the news agency reports. In March, Mr Trump approved a Pentagon plan to escalate operations against al-Shabab, including additional air strikes. Last month, dozens of American soldiers were deployed to Mogadishu to train and equip Somali and African Union troops. It is thought to be the first time US forces were sent to Somalia since 1995 - not including covert operations - though some counter-terrorism advisers were already there. Analysts say the soldier killed on Thursday would not have been one of the soldiers recently sent to Somalia.

"Angella Reid fired as White House chief usher The Trump administration has fired the White House chief usher, who is responsible for the management of the building and its staff. Angella Reid was the first woman and second African-American to serve in the position after a career in hospitality. ""She is no longer employed here at the White House. We left on very good terms and we wish her the very best,"" said spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. It is simply nothing more than the transition of staff, she added. According to the White House Historical Association, the chief usher's role includes overseeing ""construction, maintenance, remodelling, food, as well as the administrative, fiscal and personnel functions"". The Jamaican-born Ms Reid worked closely with the First Family and provided guidance on matters of furnishing, art, and decor, writes the Washington Post. She told the paper she had no comment to make about her departure. She was very close to the Obama family, the newspaper reports.  ""It gives me a sense of awe,"" she told CNN in 2016, ""the fact that slaves built this house and I now work in this house as a leader, something out of my wildest dreams.""  Because the chief usher is not a political position, it is not compelled to change at the beginning of a new White House administration.

"Local and mayoral results: Tories advance amid Labour losses The Conservatives have made the biggest gains by a governing party in a local election for more than 40 years.   With five weeks to go to the general election, they gained more than 500 seats and seized 11 extra councils. The gains mainly came at the expense of Labour, which came third in Scotland, and UKIP, which lost all of its seats. The Lib Dems failed to make headway. Polling expert John Curtice puts the Tories' national vote share at 38%, Labour 27%, Lib Dems 18% and UKIP 5%. Conservative leader Theresa May sought to combat any complacency in her party's ranks by saying she was ""taking nothing for granted"" in 8 June's general election. Mrs May said she would be fighting every day of the next five weeks to ""earn the support of the British people"" to strengthen her hand in negotiations with the European Commission over Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party had done better than expected in some places, such as Cardiff and Swansea, but results elsewhere had been ""very disappointing"". ""Of course I'm disappointed, we have to get our supporters out to vote in June, we have to get our message across and I'm utterly determined to do that,"" he said. He insisted he was the right person to get Labour's message across to voters but conceded that Labour faced a challenge on a ""historic scale"" if it is to regain power.  ""We know this is no small task,"" he said in a statement, ""but we, the whole Labour movement and the British people, can't afford not to seize our moment."" Polling expert John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said that if the council results were reflected at next month's general election, Theresa May would win a bigger majority - but probably not enough to get the landslide she was hoping for. The 11-point Tory lead over Labour in the projected national share is smaller than their 17% average lead in recent opinion polls, he added, but he cautioned against reading too much into the projections. Much could change in the coming weeks of what's likely to be a brutal general election campaign. Theresa May insists still that the vote could be close, warning her supporters not to take a majority for granted. The results don't translate necessarily into a big Tory win. But according to those who put crosses in a box on Thursday, the ground is prepared. Read Laura's blog in full

         The Conservatives gained more than 500 councillors and won closely fought battles for elected Metro Mayors in the West Midlands and Tees Valley. They also forced Labour into third place in its former stronghold of Scotland and won control of Monmouthshire in Wales. Their victories in English county council elections, where they gained control of Derbyshire, Norfolk, Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire and the Isle of Wight, were fuelled by a collapse in the UKIP vote, as anti-EU supporters appeared to flock to Theresa May's party. Labour lost control of seven councils - including Glasgow, where it has held power for decades, and saw its number of seats go down by 382. It also lost the metro mayor contests in the West Midlands and Tees Valley, a traditional Labour heartland, to the Conservatives - but former cabinet minister Andy Burnham scored a big win in Greater Manchester. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell acknowledged that Labour had suffered a ""tough"" night, but insisted the results were not ""the wipe-out that some people expected"". There was still ""all to play for"" in the general election in just five weeks' time, he added, insisting ""we can close that gap"". Voters in the West of England, Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City region, the West Midlands, Tees Valley, and Cambridge and Peterborough have elected ""metro mayors"" covering combined local authority areas. The Conservatives have won four out of the six new mayor posts. Labour former cabinet minister Andy Burnham has won Greater Manchester, with 63% of the vote - hailing it is a ""new era"" in British politics - and Steve Rotherham won for Labour in Liverpool. In the West Midlands, Conservative Andy Street, a former John Lewis boss, beat former Labour MP Sion Simon. Ben Houchen, who won Tees Valley for the Conservatives, said after defeating Labour's Sue Jeffrey: ""We are seeing a massive trend towards the Conservatives. We have started to turn the Tees Valley blue."" The mayors will mostly be responsible for economic development, but some will have powers over transport and housing. The SNP has replaced Labour as the biggest party in Glasgow, but fell short of a majority. And despite also replacing Labour as the largest party in Aberdeen, and finishing as comfortably the biggest party across the country, the SNP lost overall control of Dundee and Angus councils - the only two areas where it had won majorities in 2012. It was a strong night for the Conservatives, who increased their number of councillors by more than 130, including in areas that had previously been ""no-go"" for the party.  SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a ""clear and emphatic"" victory for her party and a ""great springboard for the general election,"" saying the Tory gains were at the expense of Labour. But Labour's John McDonnell said the SNP had fallen back, a sign of the ""increasing rejection"" of the case for a second independence referendum. It was a mixed picture for Labour in Wales, where it has been the dominant force in local government for decades.  Labour lost control of Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and its leader in Merthyr Tydfil, but held seven councils. Wayne David said the Tories made fewer gains than expected as Welsh Labour was ""in touch with people's realities"". The highlight for the Conservatives was winning a majority in Monmouthshire, but they also made progress elsewhere, increasing their number of councillors by 80. Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said his party made ""huge strides in the Vale of Glamorgan, doubled our representation in Wrexham, and reached double digits right in the backyard of the first minister [in Bridgend]"". Vaughan Gething, a member of the Labour government in Wales, said there was an ""awful lot of work"" for the party to do before the general election. He told Radio 4's Today there had been ""mixed messages"" on the doorsteps about Jeremy Corbyn but there had also been strong results - with his party ""turning back the Tory tide"" and managing to hold on to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.  UKIP's foothold in local government achieved four years ago was wiped out, as the party lost 145 seats and made just one gain. In Lincolnshire, where UKIP had 16 councillors elected in 2013 and was the official opposition on the council, the party has lost all of its remaining 13 seats.  It also lost all its seats in Warwickshire, Hampshire, Essex and the Isle of Wight, which were taken by the Conservatives. Former UKIP leadership contender Steven Woolfe said the party's influence was ""at an end"" and its former MP Douglas Carswell said ""it was over"".  But party leader Paul Nuttall said UKIP, which did well in 2013 council elections and won 3.8 million votes in the 2015 general election, was a ""victim of its own success"".  The Lib Dems increased their share of the vote by 7% but lost more than 40 seats. Lib Dem president Sal Brinton described her party's performance overall as ""patchy"", while former business secretary Vince Cable said there had been no ""spectacular breakthrough"".  The Conservatives saw off the Lib Dems' challenge to hold on to Somerset County Council and in Cumbria, where party leader Tim Farron is hoping to be re-elected as MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, they failed to increase its representation. The Green Party gained six seats, while Plaid Cymru added 33 in Wales.  What's your reaction to the results? Tell us who you voted for and why by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

"Senate Republicans doubtful of American Health Care Act Republican senators are sounding sceptical of an Obamacare replacement passed by members of their own party in the House of Representatives. The measure brings President Donald Trump's party a step closer to scrapping the law, but it will probably face major amendments in the Senate. One Republican senator said a final version will be ""near impossible"". Democrats warn the bill will strip insurance from millions of Americans and send costs rocketing. Five big consequences of Trumpcare win Obamacare v Republican plan compared The American Health Care Act passed the House of Representatives by 217-213 on Thursday without support from a single Democrat.  It marked Mr Trump's first legislative victory and goes some way to keeping a key campaign promise to roll back his predecessor's signature healthcare reform. But several Republican congressman who voted for their measure admitted they did not even read it. Trump health bill: Winners and losers Patients tell their Obamacare stories ""Oh, gosh,"" said Virginia congressman Thomas Garrett when asked on MSNBC whether he had perused the text of the far-reaching legislation. ""I don't think any individual has read the whole bill,"" he said. ""That's why we have staff."" In a celebration at the White House after the vote, President Trump declared that Obamacare was dead. Hours later, Mr Trump raised eyebrows when he praised Australia's government-funded healthcare system during a meeting with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in New York.  Progressive critics including Senator Bernie Sanders quickly pointed out Australia's universal healthcare, a system which Republicans have long attacked.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested on Friday Mr Trump was ""simply being complimentary of the prime minister, and I don't think it was much more than that"".  But Mr Trump appeared to contradict his aide an hour later, when he tweeted: ""Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do - everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great."" In a sign of the uphill battle ahead, nearly every major medical group, including the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association, strongly opposes the measure.  Critics expressed disbelief that the bill was passed without even allowing time for the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to give a cost estimate. Influential South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said: ""Like y'all, I'm still waiting to see if it's a boy or a girl.  ""Any bill that has been posted less than 24 hours… needs to be viewed with suspicion."" The CBO said an earlier Republican bill, which failed to get a vote in March, would cause 24 million Americans to lose their healthcare coverage. Other Republicans in the Senate have been outspoken in their doubts about the plan. Senator John Barrasso said they would have ""lots of amendments"". ""It's close to near impossible,"" said Orrin Hatch, who as finance committee chairman will play a key role in drafting a Senate bill. He vowed, however, to get it done. Democrats warn the measure's roll-back of Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled, would deny coverage to millions of working poor. Republicans hope to pass their bill through the Senate - where they hold a slender 52-48 majority - using a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn told reporters that it will be weeks before the chamber's Republicans can produce a new bill.

"Chechnya gay rights: Putin backs inquiry into hate crimes Russian President Vladimir Putin has backed an inquiry into a reported crackdown on gay people in the republic of Chechnya, in the North Caucasus. He said he would personally ask the prosecutor general and the interior minister to check the reports. German Chancellor Angela Merkel this week urged the Russian authorities to help protect gay rights.  Chechen officials have denied gay people even exist in the republic, amid reports of arrests and torture. On Friday, Mr Putin said he would personally ask the prosecutor general and interior minister to help Kremlin rights ombudswoman Tatyana Moskalkova check the reported abuse. During a meeting with Ms Moskalkova, the president referred to the reports as ""rumours, you could say, about what is happening in our North Caucasus with people of non-traditional orientation"", using a euphemism for gay people.  He was responding to the ombudswoman's request to set up a ""working group"" somewhere in Russia, but not in Chechnya, to ""take complaints from citizens"" on the reported abuse. Chechnya's strongman leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Friday he was ready to co-operate with the federal authorities on the issue.  But Mr Kadyrov again insisted there were no ""people of non-traditional orientation"" in the predominantly Muslim republic, part of the Russian Federation. Just a few weeks ago, ""Ruslan"" was with his wife and children in Chechnya. Now he's in a safe house for men fleeing detention and torture for being gay. Reports of a campaign against gay men by Chechen security forces have been trickling through since early April when they first appeared in a Russian newspaper. Now some of the alleged victims are starting to speak out.  ""When they brought me in, I denied everything,"" says Ruslan - not his real name. Even now, he is frightened of being identified.  Read more of his story Homophobia is widespread in Chechnya. Last month, Natalia Poplevskaya of the Russian LGBT Network said there was ""an organised campaign to detain gay men"" in Chechnya. Victims of the crackdown - who were either gay or just perceived to be gay - were being held at a detention centre near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny, she said. ""Torture is going on with electric shocks, beatings with cables,"" she told the BBC, adding that three deaths had been reported. ""All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay."" A Chechen government spokesman, Alvi Karimov, denied the allegations. ""You can't detain and repress people who simply don't exist in the republic,"" he said. Homosexuality was decriminalised in the Russian Federation in 1993 but concern about homophobia remains high.

"North Korea claims CIA plotted to kill Kim Jong-un North Korea has accused US and South Korean agents of plotting to kill its Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un. A North Korean referred to only as ""Kim"" was paid to carry out an attack with biochemical substances, the ministry of state security said. The plot was foiled, it said, but gave no details on the fate of ""Kim"". The CIA declined to comment and South Korea has issued no statement so far. The North's claim comes amid continued high tension on the Korean peninsula. US President Donald Trump has promised to ""solve"" North Korea and stop it developing nuclear weapons. Full text of North's allegation The statement should be treated with scepticism. The regime has a track record of false information. It would be surprising if American or South Korean intelligence agencies didn't try to have agents in North Korea but the specific allegations about an assassination plot raise many questions. Why hasn't a suspect been produced? Why does the KCNA statement cite poisoning at one moment and a bombing the next? How would anyone get access to Kim Jong-un, a man perpetually surrounded by squads of protectors and whose movements are secret? Journalists who go to Pyongyang have cell-phones taken off them whenever they go to events where he might be, presumably to prevent tracking - so how would an ordinary citizen get more access? Plots to kill Kim Jong-un may have been hatched but a bald statement by the media controlled by a vicious regime does not add up to convincing evidence. The ministry of state security statement, carried by state news agency KCNA, said the CIA and South Korean intelligence services had ""hatched a vicious plot to hurt the supreme leadership of the DPRK"". It did not mention Kim Jong-un by name, but he is widely referred to as the supreme leader. The ministry said a plot had been hatched to use ""bomb terrorism"" to target the supreme leadership at a military parade or at an event at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum of Kim Il-sung, the country's founding leader. It said ""Kim"" had been told that the best method was the use of ""biochemical substances including radioactive substance and nano poisonous substance"" whose results would ""appear after six or 12 months"". June 2014: A North Korean working at a timber firm in the Khabarovsk territory of far-eastern Russia is ""corrupted and bribed"" by CIA and South Korean intelligence agents.

Further communications take place in April. The last date that appears in the North Korean statement is ""early May"", when ""Kim"" is supposed to receive ""necessary equipment"" via a ""liaison centre"" he has set up with his funding. No details are given on ""Kim's"" apprehension or fate Source: Ministry of state security statement via KCNA Full text of North's allegation ""Only the CIA can produce such substance"", it said, adding that South Korea had borne the funding. The ministry alleged that the North Korean man had been ""turned"" by the CIA and the South Korean intelligence service while working in Russia in 2014. The ministry refers to two payments to ""Kim"" of $20,000 (£15,500) and a further two of $100,000 for ""bribery"" and obtaining equipment. It refers to another of $50,000 but it is unclear if this is additional.  On his return to Pyongyang, it says, he was instructed to provide detailed information about a frequently used event ground and to assess possible methods of attack. What's changed between US and N Korea? Trump: I would meet Kim Jong-un North Korea crisis: Your questions answered The ministry statement gave no details of how the alleged plan had been uncovered or about the fate of ""Kim"", whom it described as ""human scum"". The ministry said the ""intelligence and plot-breeding organisations of the US imperialists and the puppet clique"", referring to the South, would be swept away. Earlier this year, Kim Jong-un's half brother, Kim Jong-nam, was killed with the banned nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur international airport. South Korea and Malaysia say it was an assassination carried out by the North. A war of words between the West and nuclear-armed North Korea has escalated in recent weeks, with Pyongyang threatening to carry out a sixth nuclear test. On Saturday, North Korea conducted its second failed ballistic missile test in two weeks. The US has sent a warship to the region and installed a controversial anti-missile defence system in South Korea. President Trump has warned of ""major, major conflict"" with North Korea. But he also said this week he would be willing to meet Kim Jong-un, in the right circumstances.

"Nigeria's President Buhari appears in public amid health concerns Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has made a rare public appearance amid ongoing questions about the state of his health. Photos and a video posted on Twitter showed Mr Buhari, 74, attending Friday prayers at a mosque in the presidential villa in the capital Abuja. The footage showed the president shaking hands with fellow worshippers. Aides say Mr Buhari has been resting after receiving medical treatment in London for an undisclosed illness. Earlier this week, the president missed his third cabinet meeting in a row, stoking further debate about his condition. Until Friday, he had not been seen in public for two weeks. Mr Buhari returned from the UK in March after seven weeks of sick leave. When he returned home he said he had never been so ill in his life. Since then he has rarely been seen outside of his official residence. His wife, Aisha, has said that her husband is not as sick as is being perceived. Correspondents say a power vacuum in Nigeria, or even the perception of it, could have damaging effects.  The country is at a crucial stage as it struggles to emerge from recession. Last week, presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said Mr Buhari was ""taking things slowly, as he fully recovers from the long period of treatment"".

"Syria war: Refugee who fled Homs with violin releases album A Syrian refugee who fled the fighting in his country carrying a violin on his back is to have an album released by a major record label. Rami, 21, was a music student and left the city of Homs in 2015. He now lives in Germany, after crossing eight countries, often on foot. During his journey through Europe, he was thrown off a train and lost his violin while being chased by police. But in Germany, he was given another instrument after sharing his story. The musician travelled through Lebanon and Turkey to Istanbul. From there he crossed to Greece by boat, carrying his violin wrapped in cling film. While making the journey, the engine of the boat broke down, and he was rescued by the Greek coast guard and taken to the island of Kos, where many refugees were being housed.  ""I slept together with the violin because I was scared of someone stealing it,"" he said in a video posted by Decca Records, which will release the album, called My Journey. From Kos, he went on to Athens and then to Macedonia, where he caught the attention of journalists while playing his violin. Initially, he said, he performed Arabic music. Then he played Beethoven's Ode To Joy, the first track of the album, and also the European Union's official anthem. Next, Rami went to Serbia, where, according to the video account, he was punished for talking to the media about the bad conditions in which they were being kept.  He was separated from his friends and spent days without food or water. Rami was released only after a police officer noticed his violin. ""He asked me to play for him, so I played. This made him very happy."" The hurdles did not end in Serbia. While crossing from Belgrade to Budapest, in Hungary, he was thrown out of the train by police and continued his journey on foot with a friend, who was carrying the violin. But when the police chased them, both ran in different directions, and Rami ended up losing his instrument. He was later caught by police and sent to a camp. The situation there was bad, he recalled. He decided to leave the camp and walk through the night to Austria. The violinist then went on to Munich, in southern Germany, and finally to Sasbachwalden, where he found refuge. ""There was a woman who was helping the people [and] and I told her my story,"" he said. ""She introduced me to a maestro called Jochen Lemme and he gave me a violin as a gift.""  1.

Arrives in Lahr, where he started practising at a local church From there, Rami says he later moved to Lahr, where he lived in a sports hall which housed more than 200 families. A local church allowed him to practise and a picture of him was published in the local newspaper. After reading the story, a couple offered him accommodation in their house, where he would be able to rehearse. ""I think he can't imagine life without his violin,"" said Theresia, who welcomed him into her home. Rami recorded My Journey with award-winning producers James Morgan and Juliette Pochin.

"Nigeria Chibok girls: Eighty-two freed by Boko Haram Islamist militants of the Boko Haram group have released 82 schoolgirls from a group of 276 they abducted in north-eastern Nigeria three years ago, the president's office says. They were handed over in exchange for Boko Haram suspects after negotiations. The girls arrived in the capital Abuja on Sunday, and will be received by President Muhammadu Buhari. The abduction of the so-called ""Chibok girls"" triggered a global outcry and sparked a huge social media campaign. Before the latest release, about 195 of the girls were still missing. The number of Boko Haram suspects released by authorities remains undisclosed. The 82 schoolgirls are now in the custody of the Nigerian army and were brought by road convoy from a remote area to a military base in Banki near the border with Cameroon, the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty reports from Lagos. Read more: Our reporter says that many families in Chibok will be rejoicing at this latest news, but more than 100 of the girls taken have yet to be returned. Christian pastor Enoch Mark, whose two daughters were among those kidnapped, told Agence France-Presse: ""This is good news to us. We have been waiting for this day. We hope the remaining girls will soon be released."" It was unclear whether his daughters had been freed. A statement from a spokesman for President Buhari said he was deeply grateful to ""security agencies, the military, the Government of Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and local and international NGOs"" for playing a role in the operation. In a later BBC interview, presidential spokesman Garba Shehu added: ""With all of these things together we negotiated over a period of several months, and at the end of it some of their (Boko Haram's) members were exchanged for the 82 girls."" Information about the release began trickling out on Saturday afternoon.  A soldier contacted the BBC to say that more than 80 Chibok girls were being held in an army base near the Cameroon border. At the same time an official working for an international agency, who assisted with the release, said that several armoured vehicles left Maiduguri - the city at the centre of the Boko Haram insurgency - in a convoy to travel into the ""forest"" to meet the girls. He said there were two blindfolded men in the convoy. The president's office said that the girls were released in exchange for some Boko Haram suspects held by the authorities - but we haven't been told how many. After the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno state, was raided in April 2014, more than 50 girls quickly escaped and Boko Haram then freed another 21 last October, after negotiations with the Red Cross. The campaign for the return of the girls drew the support of then US First Lady Michelle Obama and many Hollywood stars. Last month, President Buhari said the government remained ""in constant touch through negotiations, through local intelligence to secure the release of the remaining girls and other abducted persons unharmed"". Many of the Chibok girls were Christian, but were forced to convert to Islam and to marry their kidnappers during their time in captivity. Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of other people during its eight-year insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in north-eastern Nigeria. More than 30,000 others have been killed, the government says, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee from their homes.",Sunday 07 May 2017,7-May-17,At least 80 Chibok girls freed in Nigeria,The abduction of 276 girls in 2014 sparked a global outcry and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39833309
"French election: Hollande vows 'response' to Macron hack attack French President François Hollande has promised to ""respond"" after a hacking attack targeted presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. He gave no further details but said he knew of the risks of such attacks because they had ""happened elsewhere"". The French media and public have been warned that spreading details of the attack would breach strict election rules and could bring criminal charges. The centrist Mr Macron faces far-right candidate Marine Le Pen on Sunday. A trove of documents - said to mix genuine files with fake ones - was released online shortly before campaigning ended on Friday. Mr Hollande told Agence France-Presse on a visit to a cultural centre in Paris: ""We knew that there were these risks during the presidential campaign because it happened elsewhere. Nothing will go without a response."" He did not elaborate, but Mr Macron's team has already been the victim of attacks which it blames on groups based in Russia and Ukraine, and last year's US election campaign was also the subject of hacking attacks targeting the Democratic Party. Mr Hollande added that he could not say whether the attack was an attempt to destabilise the election. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the impact of the hacking attack on the vote is unlikely to be significant, as Mr Macron enjoyed a wide lead in opinion polls that were taken before campaigning ended. It is part of the restrictions that came into force at midnight local time on Friday.  No campaigning or media coverage of it that could sway the election is allowed until polls close at 20:00 local time (18:00 GMT) on Sunday. Some overseas French territories have already begun voting. The election commission warned it could be a criminal offence to republish the leaked data. Politicians and media are forbidden from giving details of, or commenting on, the leak. The election commission said in a statement on Saturday: ""On the eve of the most important election for our institutions, the commission calls on everyone present on internet sites and social networks, primarily the media, but also all citizens, to show responsibility and not to pass on this content, so as not to distort the sincerity of the ballot."" Analysts say that, given the open flow of social media content, policing this could be impossible. The French daily Liberation covered the leak by publishing a general Q&A with a journalist.  Le Monde said it would ""not publish the contents before the second round"". It said it would vet and publish relevant material but ""respecting our journalistic and ethical rules"". It also carried a general Q&A of the leaks. Florian Philippot, deputy leader of Ms Le Pen's National Front party, got a tweet in before the rules came in, saying: ""Will Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately kept silent?"" The documents were leaked on a file sharing website late on Friday. About nine gigabytes of data were posted by an anonymous user. Mr Macron's En Marche movement said internal campaign documents, including emails and financial data, had been taken in an ""act of massive, co-ordinated hacking"". ""The leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement,"" it said in a statement. The hashtag #MacronLeaks appeared on Twitter on an account used by a US alt-right figure on Friday afternoon - and was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting the use of automated bots to spread the information faster. Within 90 minutes, the information had caught the attention of prominent supporters of Marine Le Pen and was further spread by bots. Some three-and-a-half hours after the initial tweet, #MacronLeaks had been used some 47,000 times and the prominent Wikileaks account played a key role in publicising the hashtag. Unclear. The Macron camp has not blamed any specific party but said the hack clearly aimed to damage it and undermine French democracy, It compared it to the leak of Democratic Party emails in last year's US presidential election that was blamed on Russian hackers. Wikileaks, which published those emails, posted a link to the Macron documents on Twitter but implied it was not responsible. %  Emmanuel  Macron  %  Marine  Le Pen Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart. The polling average line  looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower. Macron campaign servers went down for several minutes in February after attacks apparently originating in Ukraine. And last month, security experts from the company Trend Micro said that Russian hackers were targeting Mr Macron's campaign, using phishing emails, malware and fake net domains in an attempt to grab login names, passwords and other credentials of campaign staff Mr Macron's team said it suspected the Kremlin of wanting to help Ms Le Pen, who supports a pro-Moscow foreign policy. Russia has denied that it is behind attacks aimed at Mr Macron. France's voters have rejected the two big political parties - the Socialists and the Republicans - that have governed for decades. Voters will be making a decision on France's future direction and on its place at the heart of the European Union.  If they opt for liberal Emmanuel Macron, they will be backing a candidate who seeks EU reform as well as deeper European integration, in the form of a eurozone budget and eurozone finance ministers.  If instead they choose far-right Marine Le Pen she promises quite the opposite. She wants a Europe of nations to replace the EU. One of the overriding issues is unemployment, which stands at almost 10% and is the eighth highest among the 28 EU member states. One in four under-25s is unemployed. The French economy has made a slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and all the leading candidates say deep changes are needed. Economic challenges facing next president Marine Le Pen wants the pension age cut to 60 and to ""renationalise French debt"", which she argues is largely held by foreigners. Emmanuel Macron wants to cut 120,000 public-sector jobs, reduce public spending by €60bn (£50bn; $65bn), plough billions into investment and reduce unemployment to below 7%.

"Pope Francis angered by America's 'mother of all bombs' name Pope Francis has criticised the naming of the US military's largest non-nuclear explosive ever used in combat as ""the mother of all bombs"". ""I was ashamed when I heard the name,"" the pontiff told an audience of students at the Vatican. ""A mother gives life and this one gives death, and we call this device a mother.

What impact did the bomb have on IS? The Pentagon said it was dropped from a US aircraft in Nangarhar province, targeting a tunnel complex used by IS. The explosive is officially called the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB), but is widely known as ""the mother of all bombs"".

"Seamus Ruddy: Human remains found in search of French forest Human remains have been found at the site in northern France where a search has been taking place for the body of Seamus Ruddy, one of the Disappeared. News that human remains had been uncovered came on Saturday morning. Investigators from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains have been digging at the site in Foret Domaniale, near Rouen, since Monday. Mr Ruddy was working as a teacher in Paris in 1985. He was murdered by republican paramilitaries, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), and secretly buried. The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during Northern Ireland's Troubles. It is a miserable day in northern France. Mist clings to the tree tops in a heavily-wooded area, just south of Rouen.  Among the trees, a man-made clearing is populated by workmen in fluorescent vests. They make up the team from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains.  For the past week, they've been clearing away trees, saplings and undergrowth in the search for Seamus Ruddy. Now it seems that search has reached a conclusion with the discovery of human remains.  The 50 sq kms of forest are home to an array of wildlife, with deer and wild boar roaming freely. During the hunting season, the usually quiet remoteness of this part of Normandy is shattered by the sound of gunfire.  In May 1985, nobody heard the shot that killed Seamus Ruddy except those who murdered him. His body was buried in the flinty soil and left there.  The Newry-born teacher who had been working in Paris when he disappeared, was murdered by the INLA. He became one of a group known as the ""Disappeared"".  For 32 years, his family has been trying to locate his body to bring him home for a Christian burial. Today, under a rain-soaked tent, what could be his remains may mark the end of that sorrowful quest. Mr Ruddy's sister, Anne Morgan, was the last member of his family to see the County Down teacher alive.  She visited the scene on Friday. It is understood she has been informed about the discovery. This latest search began in a forest at Pont-de-l'Arche after new information on the whereabouts of Mr Ruddy was passed to the ICLVR from the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) and former INLA members. The group has close links to the INLA. Sources in the IRSP claim Mr Ruddy went willingly with INLA members from Paris to the wooded area, where there was an arms dump.  What happened among the group is not clear but Mr Ruddy was shot dead. He was buried in a shallow grave.  Sources claim that INLA members returned to the spot the following day, removed the arms cache and buried Mr Ruddy where it had been.   It is understood that former INLA and IRSP members travelled to northern France last year to try to pinpoint the spot where the Newry man was buried. Mr Ruddy's sister, Anne Morgan, has said she knows the names of the people who killed her brother.  Mr Ruddy was one of four people out of 16 Disappeared whose bodies had not been found. The others are Columba McVeigh, Joe Lynskey and Army Capt Robert Nairac.",Sunday 07 May 2017,7-May-17,Remains found in search for Disappeared,A team searching for the body of a Northern Ireland teacher find human remains in France.,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-39828895
"Stephen Colbert investigated over 'homophobic' anti-Trump joke US comedian Stephen Colbert is to be investigated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over a joke about President Donald Trump. The body's chairman Ajit Pai said it received several complaints about the monologue, which some viewers branded homophobic. It concerned crude sexual references involving Mr Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. On Twitter, angry users set the hashtag #FireColbert trending worldwide. Mr Pai told radio host Rich Zeoli he had now had a chance to watch the controversial clip, which aired on Colbert's CBS programme The Late Show last Monday. ""We have received a number of complaints,"" Mr Pai said. ""We'll follow the standard operating procedures, as we always do, and make sure we evaluate what the facts are and apply the law fairly and fully."" The FCC is a US government agency which regulates TV and radio broadcasters. CBS could be fined if it decides that Colbert's joke was indecent. The FCC definition includes remarks that appeal to ""an average person's prurient interest"" or that ""depict or describe sexual conduct in a 'patently offensive' way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value"". However, Colbert could escape a fine on the basis that The Late Show airs at 23:30 EST - outside the hours of 06:00 and 22:00 when it is assumed that children could be watching.  The FCC's website claims it does not take action against sexually explicit content aired after those hours, to safeguard ""constitutionally-protected free speech rights of adults"". As The Late Show is pre-taped, the editors had also bleeped out the most offensive language before it was broadcast.  Despite demands for him to be fired over the alleged slur, Colbert said on Wednesday that he would change ""some of the words"" in the monologue but did not regret it. He then offered an olive branch to the LGBT community, saying: ""Anyone who expresses their love for another person in their own way is, to me, an American hero."" One Trump supporter who took part in the movement #GaysForTrump, tweeted on Wednesday that Colbert's original rant was ""homophobic"" and ""disgusting"", while others repeated calls for his sacking. A Twitter account devoted to getting Colbert sacked was set up on 3 May under the handle @firecolbert. Many defended the comedian, however. ""It's really rich that the people who are calling Colbert a homophobe are the Trump voters who are actively working against gay rights,"" tweeted Tammie Willis. Others noted that Mr Trump had himself been recorded using obscene language, including bragging to TV host Billy Bush about trying to have sex with a married woman.  Former Republican Governor and presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee argued that Colbert should be protected by the First Amendment, which enshrines the right to free speech in the US. ""Don't let gov't decide when speech is ok,"" he tweeted.  Mr Huckabee is himself under fire for insensitive comments, after tweeting that he would celebrate the Latino ""Cinco de Mayo"" holiday by drinking a jar of ""hot salsa"" and watching old Speedy Gonzales cartoons.

"Mount Everest: Min Bahadur Sherchan dies attempting record An 85-year-old Nepali man who was attempting to become the oldest person to climb Mount Everest has died at base camp, Nepali officials say. Min Bahadur Sherchan, a former British Gurkha soldier, was trying to reclaim the record from Japan's Yuichiro Miura, who climbed Everest aged 80 in 2013. Mr Miura broke Mr Sherchan's own record set as a 76-year-old in 2008. It comes a week after Swiss climber Ueli Steck, 40, died as he prepared to climb the mountain. Mr Sherchan died at base camp on Saturday afternoon, officials at Nepal's tourism office said. Doctors suspect he suffered a heart attack, the Kathmandu Post newspaper reported. His long rivalry with Mr Miura - a year his junior - included a 2013 attempt to reclaim the record aged 81 that had to be abandoned after late spring weather conditions worsened. In 2015 he was on his way to base camp for another attempt when a devastating earthquake struck the country, forcing him and many other climbers to abandon their plans. ""I want to climb Everest to set a record so that it will inspire people to dream big,"" he told German news agency DPA in March. ""This will instil a sense of pride among old people like me.""  ""My climb will demonstrate that age doesn't stop you from realising your goal."" Mr Sherchan began climbing in 1960, when he ascended Mount Dhaulagiri, the world's seventh-highest mountain at 8,167m (26,795 ft), the Telegraph newspaper reported. However he was already 72 when he thought about climbing Mount Everest. To prepare, he walked 1,200km (745 miles) across Nepal in 2003, DPA said. He told DPA that his inspirations were famous Nepali Sherpas Tenzing Norgay - who first reached the top of Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary in 1953 - and Apa Sherpa, who has climbed the mountain the most times.  Mr Sherchan's guide, Shiva Sapkota, told DPA that he had been in good physical health but had not spent time at high altitude since 2015.",Sunday 07 May 2017,7-May-17,"Climber, 85, dies at Everest base camp",He was trying to become the oldest person to climb the world's highest mountain.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39829636
"Stephen Fry faces blasphemy probe after God comments Police in the Republic of Ireland have launched an investigation after a viewer claimed comments made by Stephen Fry on a TV show were blasphemous. Officers are understood to be examining whether the British comedian committed a criminal offence under the Defamation Act when he appeared on RTE in 2015. Fry had asked why he should ""respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world.... full of injustice"". He later said he was not ""offensive towards any particular religion"". According to a report in the Irish Independent newspaper, no publicised cases of blasphemy have been brought before the courts since the law was introduced in 2009 and a source said it was ""highly unlikely"" that a prosecution against Fry would take place. Appearing on The Meaning of Life, hosted by Gay Byrne, in February 2015, Fry had been asked what he might say to God at the gates of heaven. Fry said: ""How dare you create a world in which there is such misery? It's not our fault? It's not right. It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?"" He went on to say that Greek gods ""didn't present themselves as being all seeing, all wise, all beneficent"", adding ""the god who created this universe, if it was created by god, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish"". The Irish Independent reported a member of the public made a complaint to police in Ennis in the same month the programme was broadcast. He was recently contacted by a detective to say they were looking into his complaint. The viewer was not said to be offended himself but believed Fry's comments qualified as blasphemy under the law, which carries a maximum penalty of a fine of 25,000 euros (£22,000). The law prohibits people from publishing or uttering ""matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion"". The government said at the time it was needed because the republic's 1937 constitution gives only Christians legal protection of their beliefs. Fry's representatives have been contacted for a comment. Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Fry said he had been ""absolutely astonished"" by some of the reaction on social media to what he had said on the show. He said: ""I don't think I mentioned once any particular religion and I certainly didn't intend, and in fact I know I didn't say anything offensive towards any particular religion."" A police spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We are not commenting on an ongoing investigation.""",Sunday 07 May 2017,7-May-17,Stephen Fry faces blasphemy investigation,Irish police are investigating the comedian after a viewer complained about comments he made in 2015.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39830447
"Venezuela protests: Women march against Maduro Hundreds of women have marched in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, continuing a wave of protests against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro. The women, dressed in white and led by opposition MPs, denounced what they consider repression by security forces. The US has also expressed concern about what UN ambassador Nikki Haley called a ""violent crackdown"". At least 36 people have died and hundreds have been injured in weeks of protests. In a statement, Ms Haley accused Mr Maduro of ""disregard for the fundamental rights of his own people"", which she said had ""heightened the political and economic crisis in the country"". Meanwhile the White House said President Trump's national security advisor HR McMaster on Friday met Julio Borges, the president of Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly. They discussed the need for the Venezuelan government to release political prisoners and hold free and democratic elections, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. Earlier a young man was shot dead in violence in the city of Valencia. In Caracas an armoured vehicle was caught on video ploughing into protesters.  ""The dictatorship is living its last days and Maduro knows it,"" former MP Maria Corina Machado told AFP news agency at the women's march.  ""That's why there are these unprecedented levels of repression."" Demonstrators are angry over what they describe as Mr Maduro's plans to amass power in his own hands. They were particularly incensed by a recent decree that creates a 500-member constituent body to rewrite the constitution, a step that would bypass the National Assembly. Amid the unrest, youths have been looting shops in several cities hit hard by the worsening economic crisis.  An AFP correspondent in the northwestern city of Valencia said it looked like a disaster zone. Meanwhile video posted on social media purportedly showed the pulling down of a small statue of Hugo Chavez in the western town of Rosario de Perija. Mr Maduro succeeded Mr Chavez, a popular but divisive leader, who had introduced wide-ranging social welfare programmes and died in 2013. Since then, falling prices for Venezuelan oil exports have cut government revenue and there have been shortages of food, baby milk, medicine and other basics. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that inflation in Venezuela will be above 700% this year.

"Syria safe zones: Fighting 'eases' as plan takes effect Fighting has eased in parts of Syria where a Russian-led initiative to halt the country's six-year war took effect from midnight, activists say. The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four ""de-escalation zones"" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition grouping says it has little faith in the deal.

Labour's John McDonnell says there is much to learn from reading Karl Marx's Das Kapital.  What is it? Well, it's over 200,000 words long but we've had a go at summarising its main points.  Das Kapital is essentially an explanation of how the capitalist system will destroy itself. Marx had already set out his ideas on class struggle - how the workers of the world would seize power from the ruling elites - in the Communist Manifesto and other writings. Das Kapital is an attempt to give these ideas a grounding in verifiable fact and scientific analysis. In simple terms, Marx argues that an economic system based on private profit is inherently unstable because it relies on the exploitation of workers. Read more.

"Hamas chooses Ismail Haniya as new leader The Palestinian militant group Hamas has announced that Ismail Haniya has been chosen as its new overall leader. He succeeds Khaled Meshaal, who has served the maximum two terms in office. Mr Haniya, 54, lives in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled since 2007, unlike Mr Meshaal, who lives in Qatar. Mr Haniya is seen as a pragmatist who will try to ease Hamas's international isolation. The group published a new policy document this week regarded as an attempt to soften its image. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum confirmed on Saturday that Mr Haniya had been selected as the politburo chief. Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, EU, UK and other powers. This week, Hamas published its first new policy document since its founding charter. It declares for the first time a willingness to accept an interim Palestinian state within pre-1967 boundaries, without recognising Israel. It also says Hamas's struggle is not with Jews but with ""occupying Zionist aggressors"". The 1988 charter was condemned for its anti-Jewish language. Mr Barhoum said: ""The document gives us a chance to connect with the outside world."" A spokesman for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was ""attempting to fool the world but it will not succeed"". The new document stresses it does not mean that Hamas now recognises Israel's right to exist or that it no longer advocates violence against Israel. Gaza has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt for the past decade, imposed to prevent attacks by militants inside the territory. Its economy has been crippled as a result, and many of its 1.9 million inhabitants suffer daily hardships. Relations between Hamas and Egypt have recently begun to improve, with a visit to Cairo this year by Mr Haniya. Ismail Haniya was born in the Shati refugee camp to the west of Gaza City and although a close associate of Hamas's spiritual leader, the late Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, he was relatively unknown until he headed the Hamas list that won the Palestinian legislative election of January 2006 and became prime minister.",Sunday 07 May 2017,7-May-17,Hamas chooses new leader from Gaza,The 54-year-old takes over in a week that saw the militant group adopt a new policy document.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39830253
"Emmanuel Macron defeats Le Pen to become French president Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron has decisively won the French presidential election, defeating far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. Mr Macron won by 66.06% to 33.94% to become, at 39, the country's youngest president. Mr Macron's win ends the decades-long dominance of the two traditional main left-wing and right-wing parties. He said that a new page was being turned in French history. ""I want it to be a page of hope and renewed trust,"" he said. Mr Macron said he had heard ""the rage, anxiety and doubt that a lot of you have expressed"" and vowed to spend his five years in office ""fighting the forces of division that undermine France"". He said he would ""guarantee the unity of the nation and... defend and protect Europe."" Mr Macron's supporters gathered in their thousands to celebrate outside the Louvre museum in central Paris and their new president later joined them. In his speech to the crowd, he said: ""Tonight you won, France won. Everyone told us it was impossible, but they don't know France."" But he repeated a number of times that the task facing him and the country was enormous. He said: ""We have the strength, the energy and the will - and we will not give in to fear."" His mention of Ms Le Pen drew loud boos, and he said he would do all he could to ensure in future there would be no reason to vote for extremism. Security remains tight in the capital and there were reports of police firing tear gas at several hundred anti-capitalist protesters near the Ménilmontant metro in the 20th arrondissement. In her speech, she thanked the estimated 11 million people who had voted for her. She said the election had shown a division between ""patriots and globalists"" and called for the emergence of a new political force. Ms Le Pen said her National Front party needed to renew itself and that she would start the ""deep transformation of our movement"", vowing to lead it into upcoming parliamentary elections.  She also said she had wished Mr Macron success in tackling the ""huge challenges"" facing him. ""It's the people who decide,"" Marine Le Pen told me during the final days of the run-off campaign. The people have now decided that they don't want her as their president. Ms Le Pen lost this election comprehensively. But in winning more than 30% of the run-off vote, she has taken a significant step towards her goal of making her movement respectable and electable. Ms Le Pen may now try to broaden her party's approach. She'll even re-name her party, on the assumption that the National Front's name is an obstacle to winning over more voters. At the party's campaign headquarters on election night, supporters carried blue-coloured roses, Ms Le Pen's favoured symbol. She even danced to I Love Rock and Roll. It may have been a strange way for a beaten presidential hopeful to spend the night, but this party has long term plans. Supporters will save their blue roses for 2022. Read more: What does Marine Le Pen do now? He is a liberal centrist, pro-business and a strong supporter of the European Union. He left the Socialist government of President François Hollande last August to form his new movement - En Marche - saying it was neither left nor right wing. His campaign pledges included a 120,000 reduction in public-sector jobs, a cut in public spending by €60bn (£50bn; $65bn), and a lowering of the unemployment rate to below 7%. He vowed to ease labour laws and give new protections to the self-employed. Mr Macron also stood on a pro-EU platform, in stark contrast to his opponent. What are Macron's key policies? Often with Emmanuel Macron one fears that (in a way that is very French) it is words that are doing his work. Words that are bridging the divides; words that are flattering his opponents; words that create the devotion that, among some, he inspires. In the campaign it became a joke among journalists how often his answers included the words ""au meme temps"" (at the same time). It was his way of marrying everything and its opposite, of reconciling every contradiction. He got away with it because he is who he is. But in the real life of running a fractious, angry, divided country - will his words have the same effect? Will his solitary self-belief create the structures of political support which he needs in the rough-and-tumble of government? Will his charm still work? Read more from Hugh Most of those running the EU were breathing a sigh of relief, given Ms Le Pen's policies and last year's Brexit vote. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted: ""Happy that the French chose a European future."" Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations to Mr Macron for the ""big win"" and said he looked forward to working with him. German Chancellor Angela Merkel tweeted her congratulations, saying Mr Macron's win was a ""victory for a strong united Europe"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president."" Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage sounded a dissonant note, saying: ""Macron offers five more years of failure"" and encouraging Ms Le Pen to ""stick in there"". At home, President François Hollande congratulated Mr Macron and said the result showed the French people wanted to unite around the ""values of the republic"". Currently, his En Marche grouping has no seats in parliament at all. Legislative elections follow on quickly from the presidential poll - on 11 and 18 June. En Marche will contest the elections as a party but Mr Macron may find himself needing to pull together a coalition to govern effectively.

"North Korea 'detains US citizen Kim Hak-song' North Korea says it has detained a US citizen on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state. Kim Hak-song worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and was held on 6 May, state-run news agency KCNA said. Three other US citizens are currently held in North Korea, including Kim Sang-duck, who had taught at PUST. The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining its citizens to use them as pawns. KCNA said that ""a relevant institution"" was ""conducting [a] detailed investigation"" into Kim Hak-song's alleged crimes. It gave no further details. A State Department official said Washington was ""aware of reports that a US citizen was detained in North Korea"", adding it would liaise with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which helps look after US interests in North Korea. Kim Hak-song had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at PUST, Reuters news agency reported, citing an online post by Mr Kim. Inside North Korea's Western-funded university PUST is a university that mostly teaches the children of North Korea's elite.  It was founded in 2010 by a Korean-American Christian entrepreneur, with much of the costs funded by US and South Korea Christian charities. Several foreign lecturers are thought to teach at the university. The detention comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and the US. Pyongyang has threatened to carry out a new nuclear test - while the US has sent a warship to the region and vowed to stop the North from developing nuclear weapons. On Friday, North Korea accused US and South Korean agents of plotting to kill its Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un. The US and South Korean governments did not comment on the allegations, but experts were sceptical about the claim.  Kim Hak-song's arrest makes him the fourth US citizen to be held by Pyongyang.

"Rich List 2017: UK's super-rich carry on making billions The UK's richest 1,000 people ""kept calm and carried on making billions"" amid the Brexit vote of 2016, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Their wealth rose by 14% over the past year to a record £658bn, it shows. Brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who invest in property, healthcare and oil and gas, top this year's list with £16.2bn - up £3.2bn on 2016. The list includes a record number of British billionaires - 134 - with 14 new ones emerging over the last year. List compiler Robert Watts said: ""While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain's richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions."" He said a revived stock market had been behind the surge in wealth for the super-rich.  ""We expected to see a chilling effect in the run-up to the EU referendum, but that simply did not materialise,"" Mr Watts said. ""A buoyant stock market usually drives the wealth of rich-listers higher, and since last June equities have soared."" Of those in the top 20, only the Weston family - Guy, George and Galen Jr - lost money in the last year. They saw their fortune drop by £500m to £10.5bn because of a fall in the share price of Associated British Foods, in which they have a 20.8% stake.  The largest increase in wealth went to steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, who added more than £6bn to his £13.23bn valuation. However, he remains a long way from his 2008 peak of £27.7bn - a Rich List record. Others on the list include: Mr Watts said: ""We're seeing more and more diversity in the composition of the Rich List.  ""More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds, and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with hedge fund managers and private equity barons.""  Among those who lost money in this year's list were controversial businessmen Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, and Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group and the former owner of the collapsed chain store BHS. Ashley's wealth dropped by £270m to £2.16bn after shares in Sports Direct fell, while Sir Philip and Lady Green's wealth dropped by £433m to £2.78bn after he agreed to pay £363m to fund the pensions of former staff at BHS and the value of his stake in Arcadia lowered.  It now takes assets of £110m to break into the ranks of the richest 1,000 people in the UK. The figure in 2016 was £103m.  The top 20 in the list alone are worth a total of £191.77bn, increasing their wealth by £35.18bn over the past 12 months.

"Germany searches all army barracks for Nazi material Inspections have been ordered at every German army barracks, after Nazi-era memorabilia was found at two of them. The defence ministry said the command came from the inspector general of the Bundeswehr (Germany's armed forces). All barracks will be searched for material linked to the Wehrmacht, the army which served Adolf Hitler. The move follows a growing scandal over far-right extremism within the army, with an officer accused of plotting an attack disguised as a Syrian refugee. The army lieutenant, who had expressed far-right views, was arrested in late April.  Prosecutors in Frankfurt said the 28-year-old suspect had a ""xenophobic background"". Germany's Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen cancelled a planned trip to the US and travelled to his garrison in Illkirch, northeastern France. Officials found Wehrmacht memorabilia openly displayed there in the common room, despite a ban on Nazi symbols. A second barracks, Fürstenberg in Donaueschingen, southwest Germany, was then sucked into the scandal on Saturday after a display cabinet was found containing Nazi-era helmets. Spiegel online reported that pictures of Wehrmacht soldiers were found on a wall, along with Nazi pistols, more helmets and military decorations. A Defence Ministry spokesman told Reuters the items found in Donaueschingen did not include Nazi objects punishable under German law, such as swastikas.  However, Ms Von der Leyen said last Wednesday that she would not tolerate the veneration of the Wehrmacht in today's army. She said the latest scandals were no longer isolated cases, adding that ""a misunderstood esprit de corps"" had led senior officers to ""look the other way"".  The minister later apologised for the tone of her criticism, after political opponents accused her of smearing the whole army.",Monday 08 May 2017,8-May-17,German military orders Nazi material hunt,All German army barracks will be inspected after Nazi-era memorabilia was found at two.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39835609
"Nigeria Chibok girls: Freed 82 meet President Buhari The 82 schoolgirls released by Boko Haram Islamist militants have met Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. They were escorted to the reception in the capital Abuja by armed soldiers, after a check-up at a medical centre. Mr Buhari said he was joyous that they were free. He is now travelling to London for medical reasons as concern grows for his health. A spokesman said there was ""no cause for worry"" and that he was travelling for a ""follow-up"" consultation. Mr Buhari, 74, returned from the UK in March after seven weeks of sick leave. When he returned home he said he had never been so ill in his life. What illness he has remains undisclosed but concerns about his condition grew in recent weeks after he missed several cabinet meetings. The girls were handed over on Saturday in exchange for Boko Haram suspects after negotiations. They were from a group of 276 abducted in north-eastern Nigeria in 2014. Before the latest release, about 195 of the girls were still missing. The number of Boko Haram suspects released by authorities remains unknown. ""I cannot express in a few words how happy I am to welcome our dear girls back to freedom,"" Mr Buhari told the girls in Abuja, according to his office. ""On behalf of all Nigerians, I will like to share my joy with you,"" he said. Mr Buhari would have left earlier on Sunday to London but wanted to receive the schoolgirls, his spokesman Femi Adesina said. Read more: Arriving in Abuja earlier, some of the girls looked tired and confused by all the attention after spending three years in captivity. Before being taken to the capital, they were brought by road convoy from a remote area to a military base in Banki near the border with Cameroon. Our reporter says that many families in Chibok will be rejoicing at this latest news, but more than 100 of the girls taken have yet to be returned. ""This is good news to us. We have been waiting for this day,"" Christian pastor Enoch Mark, whose two daughters were among those kidnapped, told Agence France-Presse. ""We hope the remaining girls will soon be released."" It was unclear whether his daughters had been freed. A statement from a spokesman for President Buhari earlier said he was deeply grateful to ""security agencies, the military, the Government of Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and local and international NGOs"" for playing a role in the operation. In a later BBC interview, presidential spokesman Garba Shehu added: ""With all of these things together we negotiated over a period of several months, and at the end of it some of their [Boko Haram's] members were exchanged for the 82 girls."" After the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno state, was raided in April 2014, more than 50 girls quickly escaped and Boko Haram then freed another 21 last October, after negotiations with the Red Cross. The campaign for the return of the girls drew the support of then US First Lady Michelle Obama and many Hollywood stars. Last month, President Buhari said the government remained ""in constant touch through negotiations, through local intelligence to secure the release of the remaining girls and other abducted persons unharmed"". Many of the Chibok girls were Christian, but were encouraged to convert to Islam and to marry their kidnappers during their time in captivity. Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of other people during its eight-year insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in north-eastern Nigeria. More than 30,000 others have been killed, the government says, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee from their homes.",Monday 08 May 2017,8-May-17,Freed Chibok girls meet Nigeria leader,"The 82 girls released by Boko Haram meet President Buhari, who is travelling again for medical reasons.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39837763

Responding to dozens of requests on Twitter asking for help with money, she said she'll do it again in the future. People sent her screengrabs of report cards and stories of their financial troubles. The majority of the pleas were for less than $1,000 (£770) but she seemed to agree to pay $6,000 (£4600) to one student if he could be prove what it was for. The fan, called Josh, said it was for tuition fees, accommodation, food and books. She joked that if she didn't stop with the donations she wouldn't have ""any money left"". Around 30 fans were chosen. Earlier this year, Chance The Rapper donated $1m (£870,00) to schools in Chicago for ""arts and enrichment programming"". Speaking to reporters he said: ""This isn't about politics, this isn't about posturing, this is about taking care of the kids."" At the time he put pressure on others to do the same.

"Arsenal 2-0 Manchester United By Caroline Chapman BBC Sport  Arsenal ended Manchester United's 25-match unbeaten run in the Premier League and kept up their hopes of securing a place in the top four.  After a largely uneventful first half, Granit Xhaka opened the scoring with a deflected shot from distance, which looped over goalkeeper David de Gea.  And they doubled their lead three minutes later when Danny Welbeck headed home against his former club after a pinpoint cross from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Jose Mourinho introduced Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard to try to rescue the game, but they failed to bring the visitors to life.  The result means Arsenal remain in sixth place but are two points off United in fifth and six points off Manchester City in fourth, with a game in hand over both teams. This victory not only reignites Arsenal's chase for a Champions League place, but also ends an unwanted record for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger against Jose Mourinho.  The pair have endured a fractious relationship over the years, and in their previous 15 competitive meetings Wenger had never beaten a Mourinho team, with his only victory coming in the Community Shield in 2015. Mourinho has won eight times, while the remaining seven were drawn. Sunday's win ended the hoodoo and earned Arsenal only their 13th league win in 50 outings against the Red Devils.  There is still uncertainty about Wenger's future at the club, despite them still being in with a chance of Champions League football for the 21st consecutive season, and an FA Cup final against Chelsea coming up this month. When asked by BBC commentator Jonathan Pearce about whether he would be interviewing Wenger next season, the Frenchman joked: ""You want me to work for the BBC?""   Both teams had four shots on target during the match but it was Arsenal who made them count. After a dull start to the second half, the Emirates came alive when Xhaka ran into space and took a shot from 30 yards out which was helped on its way by Herrera and out-smarted De Gea. The Gunners kept up the pace and exactly three minutes and 11 seconds later, Welbeck had notched his second Premier League goal of the season. Oxlade-Chamberlain's right-wing cross whistled over the box and Welbeck rose up between the United defence to land a bullet header. Arsenal offered little in attack after the goals, but they did not need to. Mourinho revealed before the match he intended to rest key players, with one eye on the Europa League semi-final second leg against Celta Vigo, in which his team have a 1-0 advantage. The European competition could represent United's best chance of reaching next season's Champions League. The United manager made eight changes in total and his side never looked like causing a major threat.  Goalkeeper De Gea kept them in the match at half-time, producing a low stop to deny Aaron Ramsey's effort, before making a brilliant save from a rasping Oxlade-Chamberlain shot from distance.  United were undone by two quick goals early in the second half, and their only notable efforts after that came from Rooney and substitute Scott McTominay, who tried to poke home late on.

Every win is important. We had a bad patch and seem to have recovered from it."" On Welbeck's goal: ""That's the kind of goal you want from Danny. He has all the abilities a striker needs.

"Afghanistan IS head killed in raid - US and Afghan officials The head of so-called Islamic State (IS) in Afghanistan, Abdul Hasib, has been killed in a military raid, US and Afghan officials have said. He died 10 days ago in an joint special forces operation in eastern Nangarhar province, the US military said. Hasib is believed to have been behind March's attack on a military hospital in Kabul, killing at least 50 people. Last month, the Pentagon said Hasib had probably been killed in a raid by US and Afghan special forces. Two US army rangers also died in the raid, near an underground system of tunnels believed to be used by IS which were targeted by the largest conventional bomb ever used by the US. There has been no confirmation of the death by IS. Abdul Hasib was appointed as the leader of IS in Afghanistan last year after his predecessor was killed in a US drone strike. He is credited with masterminding the Kabul hospital attack, although some Afghan security experts questioned whether a group still thought to be relatively small in Afghanistan could be capable of planning and carrying out such a large scale operation. In addition to killing Hasib, the US military said US and Afghan forces had killed or captured hundreds of IS militants in an offensive this year.  ""To date, the campaign has liberated over half of the districts that IS controlled, which has allowed local residents to return to their homes for the first time in more than two years,"" the statement said. There is no independent confirmation of the claims. Sediq Sediqi, a spokesman for the Afghan president, blamed Hasib for the hospital attack and congratulated the military for killing him. ""AFG Special Forces hunted down the leader of IS in Afghanistan; big success for our heroes,"" he tweeted.  IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province (sometimes called ISIS-K) in 2015, and has since carried out a number of deadly and high-profile attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a Shia Muslim rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the Shia religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives, and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court in February that killed 22 people, and the group has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. But it has faced armed opposition from the larger and more powerful Afghan Taliban - correspondents say as a consequence, IS has struggled to increase its support or the amount of territory it holds in Afghanistan. Its main strongholds are in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar.  The failure of IS to widen its political and territorial base in Afghanistan is one reason advanced by analysts for its focus in recent months on headline grabbing attacks in the capital and elsewhere.",Monday 08 May 2017,8-May-17,IS Afghanistan leader killed - officials,"Abdul Hasib was killed 10 days ago in an operation led by Afghan special forces, Kabul says.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39839339

"Hannover evacuates 50,000 over World War Two bombs About 50,000 people in Hannover have been evacuated from their homes while experts defuse three British bombs dating from World War Two.  The operation is the second largest of its kind carried out in Germany, and has affected around a tenth of the city's population. The buildings evacuated included seven care homes, a clinic and a Continental tyre plant. Officials hope those affected will be able to return home by the evening. The evacuation deadline was 09:00 (07:00 GMT) and residents were advised to take necessary items like medication with them, as well as turning off gas and electrical appliances.  Local news outlet Hannoversche Allgemeine reported [in German] on Sunday afternoon that two unexploded bombs had been defused, and a third - which was severely damaged - might have to be made safe using a specialised cutting machine. Two other suspected bombs had turned out to be harmless scrap metal, it said. No firm deadline has been given for when the restricted zone will return to normal. Road blocks have been set up to prevent cars from re-entering the area. Emergency shelters have been established at three schools, and tens of thousands of soup portions prepared. Bomb disposal experts had initially checked as many as 13 suspicious objects, but only five were found to merit further attention - two on a building site at the city's Wedelstaße, and three others nearby. The city has set up a programme of museum tours, children's films and sporting events to help evacuees spend the day as pleasantly as possible. Allied planes bombed Hannover heavily during World War Two, killing thousands and destroying much of the city.  On 9 October 1943, an especially deadly night, 1,245 people were killed and 250,000 left homeless by 261,000 bombs. The largest bomb-related evacuation since the war happened on Christmas Day last year, in Augsburg.

"UK tourists hit by booking scams up by nearly a fifth The number of British tourists hit by booking scams rose by 19% last year, according to Action Fraud. In 2016, there were 5,826 reported cases, with holidaymakers losing £7.2 million in total, an average of £1,200 per person. The most common scams involved plane tickets, online accommodation bookings and timeshare sales. Action Fraud said reports of scams had risen consistently over the past five years. More than a quarter of those affected said the scams had a significant impact on their health or finances. About 260 people said they needed medical treatment as a result, or were at risk of bankruptcy, according to Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre. Sports events and religious festivals are a common target for scammers due to the limited supply of tickets resulting in higher prices. Holidaymakers are being persuaded to part with their cash with fake accommodation websites and adverts, with fraudsters are also hacking into official accounts to target people. Tony Neate of fraud prevention group Get Safe Online said holidays are seen as a ""big-ticket item"" so present ""the perfect opportunity for cyber criminals to swindle unsuspecting victims out of their hard-earned money"". He said people should do as much research as they could about the organisation they are booking through ""and ensure that they are a reputable travel operator that is a member of a recognised trade body like Abta"".  ""By booking in haste, you could not only risk losing a huge amount of money, but also disappoint family and friends when it comes to that long-awaited escape,"" he added.  Scam victim Stephanie Gager used cash and a bank transfer to pay for a non-existent holiday. She says when she received paperwork with all the right logos and flight information on, she assumed it was legitimate.  She was asked to pay a deposit and then told the company she would pay the remaining balance within a fortnight. However, she was then told she had to pay into a bank account ""immediately"" to get the holiday at a low price.  ""When I got to the airport they said to me, 'you're not booked on the flight'. Of course I was devastated,"" she told BBC Breakfast.  ""[Airport staff] said this happens a lot, it's worth paying that extra more to actually make the flight."" She admitted in hindsight she should have heard alarm bells at the point she was told to pay money into a bank account, and has since been given advice about how to avoid fraud. Authorities say they believe criminals are taking advantage of the lack of awareness of the UK's strict regulations on travel companies. Fake websites have encouraged tourists to pay via bank transfer or cash, claiming these are the only methods which are protected by their own bogus insurance policies. But in reality, these methods make it harder for people to get their money back.  Mark Tanzer, chief executive of travel trade organisation Abta, said: ""Abta is regularly contacted by members of the public who have been caught out by increasingly sophisticated travel-related frauds.

"Seamus Ruddy's family have 'mixed emotions' after human remains find The family of the Disappeared victim, Seamus Ruddy, have expressed mixed emotions after human remains were found during a new search for him in France. Mr Ruddy, 33, was murdered and secretly buried in 1985 by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). On Saturday, investigators found human remains near Rouen, although formal identification has yet to take place. His sister, Anne Morgan, has thanked the team and the French authorities for facilitating the search. Who were the Disappeared? Search for Disappeared begins in France Speaking from France, Mrs Morgan said her family was ""delighted"" by the discovery, but would now await the formal identification process.  ""We just want to take Seamus home and give him a Christian burial with his parents, Molly and John."" She added that they were conscious that there are three other families of Disappeared victims who have yet to find their loved ones. Chief investigator, Jon Hill, said Mrs Morgan was both upset and pleased when she was told. She was the only member of the family to travel to the search site in France, and was on her way home when the news broke on Saturday morning. Mr Hill said she has now been able to extend her stay in France, but has not yet been permitted to visit the scene of the discovery in Foret Domaniale, as recovery work is ongoing. Other members of the family were at home in Newry, County Down, when the discovery was confirmed. Mr Ruddy's brother, Terry, said: ""When I got the news this morning I could have danced and cried - and I did cry. ""I didn't quite dance, but it was a hugely emotional moment."" Mr Ruddy was working as an English teacher in Paris when he went missing.  He was one of 16 people known as the Disappeared who were murdered and secretly buried by republicans during Northern Ireland's Troubles. The INLA admitted responsibility for the killing 10 years after Mr Ruddy's death. On Saturday, his siblings spoke to Irish broadcaster RTÉ as they gathered at their parents' grave in Newry. Their missing brother's name was included on the gravestone some years ago - at their mother's request before her death.  Mr Ruddy's sister, Gertie, said she always believed his body would be found.  ""I had a gut feeling this time,"" she said.  This latest search began in France on Tuesday after new information was passed to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR). The organisation was set up after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, in a bid to relieve the torment of families who did not know what had become of their loved ones.  The new information it received was passed on by the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) - a political group linked to the INLA. Sources in the IRSP claim that before his death, Mr Ruddy went willingly with INLA members from Paris to the wooded area, where there was a weapons dump. What happened among the group is not clear but Mr Ruddy was shot dead and secretly buried. Standing in the Newry graveyard, another of his brothers, Kieran, indicated that the family had long accepted that he was dead. ""My mother went as far as to have his name inscribed on the headstone you see behind us,"" he said.  ""That was her wish - that he would be remembered whether we found him or not.""",Monday 08 May 2017,8-May-17,Family of Disappeared 'hugely emotional',Family of Disappeared victim Seamus Ruddy welcome bittersweet news that remains have been found.,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-39830815
"Stephen Colbert investigated over 'homophobic' anti-Trump joke US comedian Stephen Colbert is to be investigated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over a joke about President Donald Trump. The body's chairman Ajit Pai said it received several complaints about the monologue, which some viewers branded homophobic. It concerned crude sexual references involving Mr Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. On Twitter, angry users set the hashtag #FireColbert trending worldwide. Mr Pai told radio host Rich Zeoli he had now had a chance to watch the controversial clip, which aired on Colbert's CBS programme The Late Show last Monday. ""We have received a number of complaints,"" Mr Pai said. ""We'll follow the standard operating procedures, as we always do, and make sure we evaluate what the facts are and apply the law fairly and fully."" The FCC is a US government agency which regulates TV and radio broadcasters. CBS could be fined if it decides that Colbert's joke was indecent. The FCC definition includes remarks that appeal to ""an average person's prurient interest"" or that ""depict or describe sexual conduct in a 'patently offensive' way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value"". However, Colbert could escape a fine on the basis that The Late Show airs at 23:30 EST - outside the hours of 06:00 and 22:00 when it is assumed that children could be watching.  The FCC's website claims it does not take action against sexually explicit content aired after those hours, to safeguard ""constitutionally-protected free speech rights of adults"". As The Late Show is pre-taped, the editors had also bleeped out the most offensive language before it was broadcast.  Despite demands for him to be fired over the alleged slur, Colbert said on Wednesday that he would change ""some of the words"" in the monologue but did not regret it. He then offered an olive branch to the LGBT community, saying: ""Anyone who expresses their love for another person in their own way is, to me, an American hero."" One Trump supporter who took part in the movement #GaysForTrump, tweeted on Wednesday that Colbert's original rant was ""homophobic"" and ""disgusting"", while others repeated calls for his sacking. A Twitter account devoted to getting Colbert sacked was set up on 3 May under the handle @firecolbert. Many defended the comedian, however. ""It's really rich that the people who are calling Colbert a homophobe are the Trump voters who are actively working against gay rights,"" tweeted Tammie Willis. Others noted that Mr Trump had himself been recorded using obscene language, including bragging to TV host Billy Bush about trying to have sex with a married woman.  Former Republican Governor and presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee argued that Colbert should be protected by the First Amendment, which enshrines the right to free speech in the US. ""Don't let gov't decide when speech is ok,"" he tweeted.  Mr Huckabee is himself under fire for insensitive comments, after tweeting that he would celebrate the Latino ""Cinco de Mayo"" holiday by drinking a jar of ""hot salsa"" and watching old Speedy Gonzales cartoons. The 5 May celebration commemorates Mexico's military victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla in 1862.

"Obama warned Trump about hiring Michael Flynn Barack Obama warned newly elected President Donald Trump against hiring Michael Flynn as national security adviser, the White House has confirmed. Mr Obama warned his successor less than 48 hours after the November election during a conversation in the Oval Office, former Obama officials said.  Mr Flynn's contacts with a Russian envoy left him vulnerable to blackmail, a Senate panel heard on Monday. He was fired in February for concealing the nature of these contacts. Mr Flynn, a retired army lieutenant-general, misled the Trump administration about discussing US sanctions against Russia with the country's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before the inauguration.   White House press secretary Sean Spicer told the daily briefing on Monday: ""It's true that President Obama made it known that he wasn't exactly a fan of General Flynn's."" But Mr Spicer said that should not come as a surprise ""given that General Flynn had worked for President Obama [and] was an outspoken critic of President Obama's shortcomings specifically as it related to his lack of strategy confronting Isis and other threats around that were facing America"". Are people who hate Trump just snobs? Who is Michael Flynn? Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake The Obama administration fired Mr Flynn from his role as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, citing issues of mismanagement and temperament.  Mr Obama's warning to Mr Trump came before concerns emerged about Mr Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador, a former Obama official told NBC News.  The Democratic president reportedly thought Mr Flynn was not suited for such a high-level position. When Mr Trump sat down with Mr Obama just two days after winning the election last November, it was smiles all around. Now, according to reports, it turns out Mr Obama spent part of the time warning him to steer clear of Michael Flynn - and the president-elect ignored his advice. In hindsight, Mr Trump would have been better served heeding his predecessor's advice, as the ensuing scandal over contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak quickly ended Flynn's controversial tenure as the president's national security advisor.  The timing of this revelation, just hours before Sally Yates testified on Mr Flynn's Russian ties and her own efforts to warn the Trump administration, was no fluke.  The president took a shot at the woman he fired as acting attorney general via Twitter this morning, and now Mr Obama's team is coming - anonymously - to her defence. It's yet the latest bit of evidence of an ongoing feud between the past and present presidential administrations as well as the tension between Mr Trump's inner circle and the US intelligence community.  The stakes are high, and there's no indication anyone is backing down. But on Monday, Mr Spicer questioned the former president's objections to Mr Flynn. ""If Mr Obama was truly concerned about General Flynn,"" the White House press secretary told reporters, ""why didn't he suspend General Flynn's security clearance, which they had just reapproved months earlier?  ""Additionally, why did the Obama administration let Flynn go to Russia for a paid speaking engagement and receive a fee?"" The revelation came as former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified for the first time in public before a congressional panel about Mr Flynn's contacts with Mr Kislyak. A 27-year Justice Department prosecutor, she was fired in January by Mr Trump after she refused to uphold the administration's travel ban.  Ms Yates told the Senate Judiciary subcommittee she had warned White House counsel Don McGahn about Mr Flynn during an in-person meeting on 26 January. She said she told Mr McGahn she had seen statements regarding Mr Flynn's contacts with the Russian envoy ""that we knew not to be truth"". Ms Yates said Mr Flynn had ""lied"" to the US vice-president, and the Russians were aware of this. ""That created a compromise situation,"" she said, ""a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by Russians."" She added: ""To state the obvious, you don't want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians."" Ms Yates said she could not disclose whether her knowledge derived from intercepted US intelligence communications between Mr Flynn and the envoy. Mr Flynn's links to Russia are being scrutinised by the FBI and the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as part of wider investigations into claims Moscow sought to tip the election in favour of Mr Trump, and into contacts between Russia and members of the president's campaign team. President Trump on Monday appeared to accuse Ms Yates of leaking information to media on Twitter, which she denied during the hearing.  After her testimony he tweeted: ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?""",Tuesday 09 May 2017,9-May-17,Obama warned Trump about hiring Flynn,"The White House was also told the national security chief could be blackmailed, a Senate panel hears.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39847417
"South Korea election: Voters choose new president South Koreans are voting in a presidential election, called early after a huge corruption scandal brought down their former leader.  A liberal, Moon Jae-in, is the strong favourite with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger. If Mr Moon wins, the South will likely change course on North Korea, with the candidate wanting to increase contact with the rogue regime. But corruption and the economy are greater concerns for domestic voters. A record turnout is predicted, with numbers boosted by younger voters, as South Koreans choose from 13 candidates. Polls close at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT), with the winner expected to be announced soon after. The new leader is likely to be sworn in on Wednesday.  Heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula in recent weeks have made the perennial worries over the South's volatile neighbour a key issue. Mr Moon, of the Democratic Party of Korea, has advocated greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions. Both he and Mr Ahn have urged US President Donald Trump to cool his rhetoric towards the North after his administration suggested it might take military action over Pyongyang's weapons programme. However, Hong Joon-pyo of the conservative governing Liberty Korea Party attacked Mr Moon's approach, saying on Thursday morning that the election was a ""war of regime choices"". State media in North Korea advocated a return to an earlier era of communication and co-operation known as the Sunshine policy, seen as an endorsement of Mr Moon who was part of the previous South Korean government which promoted that policy. All the candidates are promising to protect the fragile recovery in South Korea's economy - the fourth largest in Asia - and to bring down youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high. There have been vows to reform the family-run conglomerates - chaebols - which dominate the domestic economy.  Whoever wins will have to deal with China, which retaliated economically over the deployment of a US missile defence system in the South. Candidates have been promising a break from the past as symbolised by the deeply unpopular impeached former leader, Park Geun-hye. A 22-year-old voter said: ""I voted with the hope of not electing the same kind of president again in future."" South Korea has been energised by a string of events from the confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korean nuclear weapons to the ousting of the previous president over allegations of corruption. In Western democracies, there have been hints of disillusion with politics and politicians but that has not been on display here.   Candidates have vowed to clean up corruption - but so has every other winner of a presidential election in South Korea, only to get snared in the very corruption they denounced en route to power.   This election has been refreshing in that security at rallies has been lower-key than at those in the United States, in particular, and in some countries in Europe.   At times, the front-runner, Moon Jae-in, was in danger of being pulled off the stage by people tugging his hand. In March, Ms Park became the first South Korean president to be removed from power by impeachment. She is spending election day in jail and South Korean media report she will not be casting a vote. The 65-year-old is accused of allowing a close friend to extort money from companies. She denies wrongdoing - although she has repeatedly apologised  - and is standing trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power.  Huge crowds had protested against her, fuelled by anger over inequality and the perceived privilege of South Korea's elite.",Tuesday 09 May 2017,9-May-17,Polls open in South Korea election,The economy and North Korea loom large as voters choose a new president after an impeachment scandal.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39848999
"Emmanuel Macron: Tough task ahead after victory in France Emmanuel Macron took his first steps as France's president-elect on Monday but faces a tough task establishing a team that can govern effectively. His party has announced it is changing name from En Marche to La Republique En Marche (Republic on the Move). It must pick candidates quickly ahead of parliamentary elections on 11 and 18 June. It wants to be the biggest party but at the moment has no seats at all. Mr Macron beat the far right's Marine Le Pen by 66.1% to 33.9% on Sunday. But a low turnout and a record number of spoiled or blank votes showed disillusionment among many, particularly on the far left, at the choice they were given. Read more: Ms Le Pen has also signalled there will be a change to her National Front party. There are suggestions from its officials, too, that it will change its name. But she has vowed to lead the ""new force"" into the parliamentary elections. Emmanuel Macron inherits one of the most powerful positions in Europe, and all the symbolism that comes with it.  This morning at the Arc de Triomphe, he showed no sign of being awed by his new job.  He walked alongside the outgoing President, François Hollande, as the two laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  They then shook hands with veterans. Mr Macron appeared to take longer to make his way through one receiving line, stopping to talk to elderly men, leaving Mr Hollande to wait for him at the end.  Emmanuel Macron now becomes France's youngest leader since Napoleon Bonaparte, whose battles are commemorated at the Arc de Triomphe. The new president will hope that his own fights are less bloody. He faces two main problems - a complete lack of representation in parliament and a deeply divided country. Although Mr Macron won support, sometimes grudgingly, from the established Socialists and Republicans, much of it stemmed from the need to beat Ms Le Pen. The conservative Republicans in particular will be looking for a strong showing in the parliamentary polls. Polls released shortly after Mr Macron's victory suggested he and his allies in the centrist Modem party would come out top in the first round on 11 June, with 24%-26% of the vote. Both the Republicans and National Front would have about 22%, the far-left France Unbowed 13%-15% and the Socialists, still smarting from François Hollande's unpopularity, 9%. But the first-past-the-post system means it is difficult to gauge seat numbers. The National Front only has two seats and despite its candidate's performance in the presidential election, one poll suggested it might only get 15-25 in the 577 seat parliament. Such uncertainty means Mr Macron might well be faced with a serious amount of horse trading to find allies to buy into his manifesto. Another opinion poll in Le Figaro on Monday suggested many French people think this no bad thing. The Kantar Sofres-OnePoint study suggested only 34% of those interviewed hoped the new head of state would have a majority in parliament. The BBC's Lucy Williamson says Mr Macron's experience as economy minister has taught him that building cross-party consensus for each individual issue can be draining and dispiriting. Much will depend on whether his party can form a stable coalition. It is part of the move to widen support, party secretary general Richard Ferrand said, adding that Mr Macron had now stepped down as party leader given his accession to the presidency. Mr Macron intends to field candidates in all seats and has said half of them will be newcomers to politics - to try to introduce new blood. Half will be from Modem or defectors from other parties. The idea is that the candidates will not have to give up their party affiliations but will need to run under the Republique En Marche banner. He has now spoken on the phone to US President Donald Trump. The pair agreed to meet during the gathering of Nato leaders in Brussels on 25 May. The US statement on the call was fairly routine, noting the ""long and robust history of co-operation"" between the nations, although a Macron spokesman told CNN the president-elect had pointedly said he would defend the Paris climate change accord, amid growing concern Mr Trump might pull the US out. An earlier statement from the Macron team said he had also spoken to the leaders of Germany, the UK, Turkey and Canada. Tuesday 9 May: Mr Macron will mark the EU's Europe Day, the annual celebration of peace and unity in Europe. Much of his victory speeches on Sunday focused on the need for a strong Europe 10 May: Marks France's Slavery Remembrance Day, then in the afternoon attends the funeral of Corinne Erhel, the legislator who collapsed and died while speaking at a Macron rally last Friday. Official election results are published 14 May: President François Hollande formally hands over power to Mr Macron, who will start to announce his ministers, including a PM. He says he has made his choice for the post. It could be a woman, with one name touted that of former economy minister, Christine Lagarde 15-19 May: Mr Macron must finalise candidates for his party in the parliamentary election 11 and 18 June: Parliamentary election held over two rounds. All 577 seats are being contested in a first-past-the-post system Officials have suggested there will be a new name - also to broaden support. Despite Marine Le Pen's efforts to refocus the party, it has continued to suffer from its past extremist associations under her father Jean-Marie Le Pen. Nicolas Bay, party secretary-general, told the Associated Press: ""The National Front is a tool that will evolve to be more efficient, bring even more people together after the number of voters we reached last night."" Ms Le Pen hailed a ""historic result"" but admitted the need for ""profound transformation"" before the parliamentary elections. She said she would stay to lead an opposition of ""patriots"" against ""globalists"".",Tuesday 09 May 2017,9-May-17,Tough task ahead as Macron basks in win,France's president-elect is faced with a divided country and a party with no seats in parliament.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39847944
"Murdered Boston doctors sent last text: 'Gunman in house' One of two doctors killed in a luxury Boston penthouse sent a text to a friend saying, ""gunman in the house"".  A prosecutor disclosed the desperate message during the hospital bedside arraignment of Bampumim Teixeira. The accused was injured in a shootout with police at the flat where the bodies of anaesthetists Richard Field - a Londoner who sent the text message - and Lina Bolanos were found. The couple, engaged to be married, were tied up and their throats cut. The suspect was formally charged on Monday at Tufts Medical Center in Boston where he is being treated for non-life threatening injuries.  He is being held without bail on two counts of murder. His lawyer entered not-guilty pleas for him.  Mr Teixeira, 30, was arrested after police exchanged fire with him while responding to reports of an intruder at the high-rise apartment complex in South Boston on Friday night. Upon arrival, officers found a set of keys on the floor and used them to open the door when no one responded to their shouts, Suffolk Assistant District Attorney John Pappas said during Mr Teixeira's arraignment on Monday.  Mr Teixeira was struck in the hand, abdomen and leg during the shootout with the two officers.   The officers apprehended Mr Teixeira inside the penthouse flat before discovering Dr Field, 49, and Dr Bolanos, 36, who were already dead, the Boston Globe reported.  A message of retribution was apparently written on the wall, an official told the newspaper.  It is not clear whether Mr Teixeira knew the victims. A motive is unclear. He reportedly worked previously as a security employee at the condominium complex. Mr Pappas declined to say the cause of death, but said both victims had suffered ""obvious trauma"" and were pronounced dead at the scene. Dr Field - who is from London, according to his Facebook page - sent two text messages to a friend in a plea for help, Mr Pappas said.  One text said ""there was a gunman in the house"". The friend called the police, Mr Pappas added.  Police also discovered a black backpack at the scene containing jewellery, which authorities believe belonged to Dr Bolanos. A motive for the attack is still unclear and Mr Pappas did not say how Mr Teixeira was able to get through tight security to reach the top levels of the residential complex.  Mr Teixeira was recently released from prison after serving nine months for bank robbery.  His next hearing is set for 8 June.  Dr Bolanos was a paediatric anaesthesiologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Dr Field worked at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School.  Dr Bolanos had cancelled plans on Friday night to invite a surgeon for dinner because Dr Field was not feeling well, the Boston Globe reports.

"Nigeria Chibok girls: Parents learning if daughters among those freed Parents of the missing Chibok girls are slowly learning if their daughters are among the 82 freed by Boko Haram militants in Nigeria two days ago. The girls' names were put on Twitter by the president's office on Sunday. They were flown to the capital Abuja.  But in Chibok, their home region in north-eastern Nigeria, not everyone has access to the social media site. It is unclear if the government has made other attempts to let them know if their daughters are now safe. On Monday, people were checking the newspapers to see who was on the list and decide whether to make the journey to Abuja, according to the Associated Press news agency. Even parents in Abuja - where the 82 girls were flown in order to meet President Muhammadu Buhari before he left the country for medical treatment - were waiting to see if they would be reunited with their daughters. Esther Yakubu told the BBC the last three years had been a ""horrible nightmare"" but that even the possibility of her daughter having been rescued was giving her hope. ""Whether she is among the freed ones or not, I am very happy,"" she said. ""We started this year with 24 [returned girls] and now we have 106. It is a large number, and we have hope that, if they are alive, they will come back. ""I have never been happy in my life like today. I am a mother. I accept any child that is back. My baby will be back soon, if she is among them or if she isn't."" It is being reported that the girls were handed over on Saturday in exchange for five Boko Haram suspects after negotiations -  a deal which has been criticised by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), led by Senator Ahmed Makarfi. In a statement, the PDP faction said the exchange had allowed terrorists to escape punishment and would embolden them to carry out further kidnappings, while the ""piecemeal"" release of the girls meant they still held bargaining chips. But according to lawyer Zannah Mustapha, who has acted as a mediator between the Nigerian government and the extremists, some of the girls rejected the opportunity to return home. Exactly what their motivations are remains unclear, but there is speculation they may have been radicalised, or are too ashamed to return. ""Some girls refused to return... I have never talked to one of the girls about their reasons,"" Mr Mustapha told Reuters news agency. Boko Haram is thought to still be holding more than 100 of the original 276 girls taken from a school in north-eastern Nigeria in 2014.  They are far from the only people abducted by the extremist group. Amnesty International has recorded 41 cases of mass abductions in the last three years. It puts the number of women and children kidnapped at at least 2,000. For those parents receiving good news in the coming days, the wait may not be over.  None of the 21 girls who were released in October have been able to move back home, and nearly seven months later they are still being held on a military re-integration programme. They did go back to Chibok at Christmas time last year, but they were held in the house of a local politician and the families had to go there to see them. The 82 released in May were sent to a secret location in Abuja after meeting the president. There are also concerns that those girls who go back to their communities may have trouble reintegrating.  One girl, Zara, who was kidnapped by Boko Haram, though not from Chibok, told the BBC how she was stigmatised on her return because she was pregnant. She was called a Boko Haram bride and was shunned.",Tuesday 09 May 2017,9-May-17,Anxious wait for parents of freed girls,The Chibok girls freed in Nigeria were named on Twitter but many families cannot access social media.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39846326
"Venezuela indigenous group flees crisis for Brazil Around 400 indigenous Warao people from the Orinoco Delta in Venezuela have arrived in the Brazilian city of Manaus in the Amazon.  The authorities have declared a social emergency to seek government funds to help with the influx. The Warao say they travelled around 2,000 km (1,250 miles) and are fleeing hunger and Venezuela's worsening economic and political crisis.    Warao people have also gone to the northern Brazilian state of Roraima.     In Boa Vista, the state capital, city authorities say more than 500 Warao arrived across the border but were deported because of concerns about vagrancy and begging.  In Manaus, the group are begging at traffic lights and living in a makeshift encampment in terrible conditions under a viaduct near the bus station.  According to municipal secretary Elias Emanuel, the Venezuelans arrived seeking jobs in the city's industrial complex, but they lack documents needed for employment. ""Now our Federal Police will help them. We want to include them in our social programmes, too, but since they are foreign Indians we really need support,"" Mr Emanuel said in a statement. Most of the approximately 20,000 Warao inhabit Venezuela's Orinoco Delta region, with smaller numbers in neighbouring Guyana and Suriname.   According to the Brazilian Ministry of Justice more than 5,400 Venezuelans have requested visas and permission to stay in the country.  Both Roraima and Amazonas states, which border on Venezuela, have reported many more people coming across looking for basic food goods, medicine and temporary jobs.    Border towns in Roraima say tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants have been using local state hospitals and social services, which have been overwhelmed.

"China human rights lawyer Xie Yang 'admits being brainwashed' A Chinese court says a prominent human rights lawyer, Xie Yang, has admitted being ""brainwashed"" overseas at his trial for inciting subversion. It released transcripts in which he says he was trained in Hong Kong and South Korea to ""develop Western constitutionalism in China"".  In a video, he denies being maltreated since his arrest in July 2015. The lawyer's wife and human rights activists have both said that Mr Xie was tortured in custody.  His trial appears to have been held without advance public warning, the BBC's John Sudworth reports from Beijing, and there was no way foreign journalists could verify the court transcripts which, like the video, were released on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter.  He is one a number of prominent lawyers put on trial recently who have mostly represented land grab victims and campaigners for democratic reform. Such cases are considered highly sensitive by the authorities. President Xi Jinping has overseen increasing restrictions on civil society while warning that Western ideals present a threat to national security. Mr Xie has been charged with ""inciting subversion of state power and disrupting court order"". ""My actions go against my role as a lawyer,"" he said in the video released by the Changsha Intermediate People's Court.  ""I want to take this opportunity to express to other rights lawyers my view now that we should give up using contact with foreign media and independent media to hype sensitive news events, attack judicial institutions and smear the image of the nation's party organs while handling cases.""  Detained lawyers and human rights activists in China are often subject to similar show trials and abuses as those allegedly endured by Xie Yang. Human rights activists say that few if any receive a fair trial.  Mr Xie has worked on a number of cases considered politically sensitive by China's ruling Communist Party and was among hundreds of lawyers and activists detained in what became known as the ""709 crackdown"" - named after the date of the first disappearance of a group of lawyers on 9 July 2015. It was part of the toughest government action against Chinese civil society for years. Although the majority of those held were released on bail, last year six of them were found guilty of serious crimes, with some sentenced for up to seven years in prison. Mr Xie is now in a precarious position - he has not endeared himself to the government by defending mainland supporters of Hong Kong democracy activists.  Patrick Poon, of human rights group Amnesty International, said the Chinese authorities had wanted to use his trial ""to discredit his lawyers and the western media"".

"Facebook must delete hate postings, Austria court rules A court in Austria has ordered that Facebook must remove postings seen as hate speech, in a ruling that is set to have international implications. The case was brought by the country's Green Party after its leader was targeted by a false account. The court said postings not just in Austria but worldwide must be deleted. Facebook has not yet commented. The ruling is seen as a victory for campaigners who want to make social media platforms combat online trolling. The appeals court in Vienna ruled that postings against Greens' leader Eva Glawischnig - and any verbatim re-postings - should be removed. It added that merely blocking the messages in Austria without removing them for users abroad was not sufficient.  The court said it was easy for Facebook to automate this process. A Green lawmaker, Dieter Brosz, said Facebook could no longer claim it was just a platform and needed to take responsibility for tackling hate postings. Facebook is desperate not to describe itself as a publisher because of the editorial and legal responsibilities that come with that position. CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to insist that his firm is a tech company and not a media organisation - and yet his social network is unquestionably a source of news for many of its 1.94 billion users and therefore it is increasingly under pressure to take responsibility for the content posted freely on it by its members. Whether the worldwide ban on viewing targeted hate speech imposed by the Austrian court can be enforced remains to be seen, but it is reminiscent of a law journalists and broadcasters are very aware of already: that is libel, and the repetition of libel.  Whether that's fake news or hate speech, the days when people can upload what they want - and face only retrospective action if complaints are made - are perhaps numbered. Internet giants including Facebook, Twitter and Google have all come under fire in many countries for failing to remove hate speech from their platforms promptly. Last month, German ministers approved plans to fine social media firms up to 50m euros ($53.3m; £42.7m) if they fail to remove hate speech and fake news quickly. The companies have recently announced measures to address the issue:",Tuesday 09 May 2017,9-May-17,Facebook 'must delete hate postings',An Austrian court rules that messages seen as hate speech against a politician should be removed.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39852623

"South African town hit by riots after white farmers get bail Riots have hit a small town in South Africa after a magistrate granted bail to two white farmers accused of murdering a 16-year-old black boy.  Anger erupted in the maize producing town of Coligny, after residents learned that the two suspects had been freed on Monday. Three houses were torched and white-owned shops looted. The violence over the death highlights prevailing racial tensions in parts of post-apartheid South Africa.  Apartheid was a legal system of discrimination that existed in South Africa until the country's first democratic elections in 1994. Pieter Doorewaad and Phillip Schutte allegedly assaulted Matlhomola Moshoeu and then threw him out of a moving car. Local media report that the two farmers caught Mr Moshoeu stealing sunflowers on a farm near to the township where he lived, took him hostage and assaulted him.  They, however, say he jumped off a truck as they were taking him to the police. Magistrate Magaola Foso told the court that he was aware that the case had led to increased tensions in the area, but said he could not have an emotional response, the AFP news agency reports. ""There is no link between the said witness evidence and the two [accused] persons at this stage,"" AFP quotes the magistrate as saying. The teenager's cause of death is not yet known because the results of his autopsy report have not been handed over to the court. Journalists who were covering the violence were allegedly attacked by the owners of properties targeted by the rioters. They were accused of inciting violence by covering the events. Meanwhile farmers in the area are said to be on high alert, worried that they might become the next target as tensions continue. The police say they are monitoring the situation. The two men are due back in court on 26 June.",Tuesday 09 May 2017,9-May-17,SA riots after white farmers get bail,"Violence breaks out in a rural town after two men, charged with murdering a black boy, are released.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39844498
"Rare ammonite 'death drag' fossil discovered The ""death drag"" of a prehistoric ""squid"" - or ammonite - made 150-million-years-ago has been preserved as an incredible fossil. The animal's shell made the 8.5m-long mark as it drifted along the seafloor after its death.  Ammonites are one of the most common and popular fossils collected by amateur fossil hunters. This specimen (Subplanites rueppellianus) was found in a quarry in southern Germany. Its shell was preserved alongside the mark it made as it drifted along the floor of a tropical lagoon in a steady current. Such marks are rare in the fossil record. ""The fossil is perhaps one of the most unlikely of fossils to have ever been preserved, let alone be discovered,"" said Dean Lomax from the University of Manchester, UK, who led the research. ""A real chance find."" The new specimen ""provides a snapshot of a moment that is captured in time - it really tells a story"", he added.  The length of the drag mark far exceeds previous discoveries, say researchers from the UK, Germany and Spain. Ammonites lived during Jurassic and Cretaceous times. The marine animals had gas chambers, which they used to control buoyancy and movement. This particular shell was probably empty, as the animal had died, but would have been filled with gas. This meant it did not sink straight to the bottom of the sea, but was dragged along the floor by a current before falling over. ""For scientists, ammonites, like all fossils, are an important group to study,"" said Dean Lomax.  ""With a global distribution and thousands of species known, scientists are able to study a wide-range of types, from minute species to those as large as tractor tyres."" The research is published in the journal PLOS ONE.

We leave you with a clip of Michelle Obama today criticising the Trump administration's decision to suspend federal rules to make school lunch healthier.  ""Think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap,"" the former US first lady says of her pet project.  Protesters in San Diego gathered outside a Republican retreat to send a message. They spelled out ""2018"", indicating that they are mobilising for the upcoming midterm elections. Spicer again grouses about what he depicts as an overly adversarial relationship between the press and the White House. ""We work day and night to
make sure that we get you the most up-to-date, accurate information at all
times. ""I think the president’s
point… is that there are times when we’re asked a question, we do our best to
give you the answer and every word is picked apart to try to figure out how to
make an issue out of it."" Spicer says he was not asked to take a pledge of loyalty to Trump before he was hired. ""I’ve pledged my loyalty
to the constitution and to the American people,"" he says, ""as has everyone who serves in our
government and this administration, and we stand by that."" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (Republican) and ranking member Dianne
Feinstein (Democrat) have written to the Department of Justice and the FBI to request a briefing on ""the Russia investigation"". In a letter addressed to Deputy
Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Acting FBI Director McCabe, they demand a follow-up briefing to the one provided by Comey on 3 May. ""The
committee leaders requested that the FBI and Justice Department call to set
dates for the briefings by 5 pm today,"" they write, also providing both their office's phone numbers.  Wikileaks says it is offering a $100,000 (£75,000) reward for the Trump-Comey ""tapes"" President Trump suggested may exist in a tweet earlier today. Spicer kicked off his return to the podium this week by talking about the US beef industry.  Critics point out the elephant in the room on Friday - Trump's tweets this morning. A former FBI official told a White House journalist that the ""implicit threat to the FBI"" indicates that Trump is ""out of control"", says one journalist. When asked to respond, Spicer said that is ""frankly offensive"". Spicer says: ""The bottom line is,
is that the director of the FBI serves at the pleasure of the president."" Of Comey's eventual successor, the press secretary says the president wants to make
sure we have ""the right person"". The recruitment process is being headed by the Department
of Justice, he adds, which is screening candidates and will share that list with the
president. The White House Correspondents' Association is warning
President Trump not to follow through on that hint that he could do away with
press briefings. The media organisation’s president, Jeff Mason of Reuters, said: ""That exercise, conducted in full view of our republic’s citizens, is clearly
in line with the spirit of the First Amendment. ""Doing away with briefings would reduce accountability,
transparency, and the opportunity for Americans to see that, in the US system,
no political figure is above being questioned."" Spicer says Trump is ""dismayed"" by attempts to ""parse every little word"" uttered during White House press briefings.   Earlier, Trump tweeted a veiled threat to cancel the daily press briefings. ""No,"" Spicer responds when asked about a report that the president asked Comey during their January dinner if he could count on his loyalty. Press secretary Sean Spicer is back up.  He is asked about this intriguing tweet from the president... The press secretary is asked if there are any recording devices in the Oval Office, and whether the president taped a private dinner conversation with former FBI Director James Comey. ""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" Spicer says. Three times.     The BBC's Tara McKelvey asks McMasters to define America First. ""The president is prioritising the security and interests of the American people"", the national securtiy adviser explains. ""Every theme of this trip is consistent with this approach"", he says. ""This trip is going to be a tremendous way to solidify the gains already made."" McMaster says the US doesn't have to do and bankroll ""everything"", but adds that nor does it mean ""American not leading"". ""America First didn't mean America Alone ever,"" the national security adviser says.   He adds Trump ""will be welcome in all the places he is visiting on this trip"" and that America's allies must do more to share the burden of defence. McMaster says President Trump has made no final decision on whether to send more troops to Afghanistan. He says the Afghan army is currently taking the brunt of the fight against ""trans-national terrorists"". The national security adviser refuses to take questions on the firing of Comey. His own predecessor, Michael Flynn, was fired after less than 30 days on the job. ""He will bring a message of tolerance and hope to billions"" says the national security adviser about Trump's upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Rome. No president has before visited the holy lands of all three major faiths in the course of one trip, McMasters says.  The idea to visit the three regions was Trump's, he tells reporters.  McMaster says: ""The impetus for this trip
came from the president himself""… ""he’s been receiving regular briefings""… his
relations with foreign leaders ""are off to a very strong start""… this trip ""will

"FBI chief James Comey fired by Trump US President Donald Trump has fired the director of the FBI over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails, the administration says. The White House shocked Washington by announcing that James Comey ""has been terminated and removed from office"". But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The move came as it emerged Mr Comey gave inaccurate information to Congress last week about Mrs Clinton's emails. An FBI investigation into her use of a private email server to store sensitive information while secretary of state remains closed. Mr Comey said in July last year it was careless but not criminal. The White House said the search for a successor for Mr Comey would begin immediately. In a tweet on Wednesday morning, Mr Trump said Mr Comey would be replaced ""by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI"". It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired. President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that ""you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau"". Mr Sessions said the department of justice was ""committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law"", and ""a fresh start is needed"". Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation into Mrs Clinton's emails, given that Mr Trump once praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter. In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it ""took guts"" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. ""What he did brought back his reputation,"" Mr Trump said.  But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he ""cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken"". ""Almost everyone agrees the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives."" Mr Rosenstein also said:  Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.  The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank. Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.  The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations but no conclusions have yet been reached. ""Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference. ""This does not seem to be a coincidence,"" he added. Mr Trump responded on Twitter that Mr Schumer had recently expressed his lack of confidence in the FBI chief. President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russia allegations are ""fake news"". He and his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Washington later on Wednesday. Donald Trump and senior justice department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support. Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree. Read Anthony's analysis Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security. The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation. He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails. What was Clinton FBI probe about? He told the Senate last week it had made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again. Mrs Clinton lays part of the blame for her shock election defeat last November on Mr Comey. He told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded ""hundreds and thousands"" of emails, ""some of which contain classified information"", to her husband. But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had sent only two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing. In June 1972, five men were arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) at the Watergate office and hotel complex in Washington. The break-in was traced to President Richard Nixon's supporters. The firing of James Comey is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Mr Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the break-in and the subsequent cover-up. ""Not since Watergate has a president dismissed the person leading an investigation bearing on him,"" the New York Times wrote late on Tuesday. Mr Nixon later admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. He later became the only US president to resign.",Wednesday 10 May 2017,10-May-17,FBI chief Comey fired by Trump,"The White House says he was sacked for botching the Clinton email probe, but critics sense a cover-up.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39866170

"Syria war: US to arm Kurds in battle for Raqqa US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says. Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said. The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added. Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria. The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly. SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition. The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition. The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa. The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades. Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"". The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.  The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.  The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment. US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor. A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles. The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards. No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.   ""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.

"'Grotesque actions' in Penn State fraternity hazing death The lawyer for the family of a student who died after falling down stairs during a fraternity initiation has called the group's actions ""grotesque"". Timothy Piazza, 19, died in February after he became drunk during a ""pledge"" event for a fraternity, which is a social club for male students.  Mr Piazza, who was left unconscious for hours, suffered internal injuries before he died in hospital. Prosecutors charged 18 students at Penn State University over his death.  The charges came after months of a grand jury investigation, which included video from surveillance cameras, testimony and phone records from Mr Piazza's final hours inside the fraternity house.  The report concluded that there was an attempt to conceal evidence of hazing - the initiation ceremony - and underage drinking after Mr Piazza was in hospital.  Piazza family attorney Tom Kline called the footage the ""worst possible debauchery and depravity that you could possibly have anywhere, let alone a college campus"". He added the family ""saw his bright future blossoming and then it all disappeared by the grotesque actions of people who were supposed to be his friends"". Mr Piazza, a second-year engineer student from Lebanon, New Jersey, attended a pledge initiation ritual on 2 February.  Throughout the evening, Mr Piazza and other students participated in binge-drinking activities before he fell down a flight of stairs.  In a group text message just before midnight, one of the fraternity members wrote: ""Also, Tim Piazza might actually be a problem. He fell 15 feet down a flight of stairs, hair-first, going to need help."" After the fall he was slapped in the face, shaken and thrown onto a couch, where he remained for most of the night, according to the grand jury report. In the early hours of 3 February, members of the fraternity carried Mr Piazza to another couch after finding him on a basement floor with blood on his face, the report said.  At about 10:48 local time (14:48 GMT), a fraternity member called the police. Mr Piazza was taken to hospital and died the next day.  Mr Kline said the footage showed ""horrific acts of self-preservation"" and ""acts of callousness toward a young man"". He continued the students ""aggressively and affirmatively"" made sure Mr Piazza did not receive medical attention because they could have got into trouble for underage drinking.  ""He was the unfortunate road kill in this adventure by these young men who thought that they were above the law,"" he said.  The grand jury report also underscored the fraternity culture at Penn State, placing ""direct fault"" on the school's entire fraternity community for nurturing ""an environment so permissive of excessive drinking and hazing that it emboldened its members to repeatedly act with reckless disregard to human life"". Beta Theta Pi, which has since suspended and disbanded its Penn State chapter, called the charges ""incredibly disheartening"".

The South Carolina senator asked former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the matter on Monday as he testified before a Senate panel. Mr Clapper declined to answer a question about concern over any Russian ties to Mr Trump's business interests.  Mr Graham said it would be ""helpful"" to see President Trump's tax returns.  Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake ""I want to know more about Trump's business dealings,"" Mr Graham told CNN on Tuesday. But he added it was too soon to determine whether he would be willing to subpoena them from the White House.  CNN reported that Mr Graham intended to scrutinise possible links between Mr Trump's business and Russia. Mr Graham later clarified that the Senate judiciary committee he leads was not actively looking into Mr Trump's business relations.  ""There's no effort by the judiciary committee to go after business interests because I don't know of any that are illegal or irresponsible, but if you can show me there is some evidence of that I'd be interested in it,"" he said.  The White House on Tuesday said it did not oppose any inquiries by Mr Graham.  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the president ""has no business in Russia; he has no connections to Russia."" ""So he welcomes that,"" he added. During Monday's testimony, Mr Clapper was asked whether he had any concerns about Mr Trump's business interests and a possible connection to Russia.  ""Not in the course of the preparation of the intelligence communities assessment,"" said Mr Clapper, who served under former President Barack Obama.   But when Mr Graham pressed the former spy chief on whether he had ever discovered any Trump business ties to Moscow, Mr Clapper alluded to an ongoing FBI investigation.  ""Senator Graham I can't comment on that because that impacts an investigation,"" he said.  The president took to Twitter to cast doubt on any questions surrounding Mr Clapper's refusal to comment on Monday.

"Climate change: China vows to defend Paris agreement Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to protect the landmark Paris agreement, which aims to curb climate change and fossil fuel emissions. He made the promise in a phone call with incoming French President Emmanuel Macron, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. US President Donald Trump is still deciding whether to withdraw from the accord - an election campaign promise. Climate experts worry such a move would throw the agreement into chaos. A White House meeting to discuss the topic on Tuesday has been postponed, amid reports of divisions among senior Trump advisers.  It is the second time the meeting has been cancelled. No new date has been given. The current disagreement within the White House over whether the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is a prime example of the much-reported palace intrigue within the Trump administration spilling out into a policy debate. In one corner you have senior officials like strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who are on record calling for an exit from the accord. Others, like Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have been noncommittal. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the US should keep a ""seat at the table"" and presidential adviser/daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner are pro-Paris.  Donald Trump, while he did once tweet that global warming was a Chinese conspiracy, has largely avoided extended discussions on the subject. While his administration is steadily driving to roll back many Obama-era regulations, environmental issues as a whole seem of little interest to him. Any White House meeting to hash out a coherent policy on the Paris agreement is destined to be contentious and with a decidedly uncertain resolution. A battle no-one is convinced they will win is one that is ripe for delay - again. Mr Xi told Mr Macron China and France ""should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement"", according to the Chinese foreign ministry. Under former President Barack Obama, the US and China issued several joint statements on climate change, even announcing together they would sign the Paris agreement. The two countries are the world's biggest polluters. For his part, when Mr Macron received his congratulatory phone call from the US president he told him he would also seek to defend the climate deal. Speaking on Tuesday at a conference in Milan, Italy, Mr Obama said the US and China had to ""lead the way"" in the fight against climate change. ""The good news is the private sector has already made a determination that the future is clean energy,"" he said. ""Those things are locked in now, into the energy sector. Because of the debates taking place in the current administration the steps may be taken more slowly than they would have been done, but I'm confident,"" he added. The latest comments come as climate negotiators meet in the German city of Bonn to discuss how to put the Paris agreement into practice. Almost 200 countries have backed the agreement, which aims to keep global temperature increases ""well below"" 2C. It also seeks to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels in an effort to limit floods, droughts and rising sea levels. President Trump has previously said he believes there is no evidence that humans are responsible for climate change. He has called for more drilling, fewer regulations and the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada.",Wednesday 10 May 2017,10-May-17,China vows to defend climate pact,The comments come amid uncertainty over whether the US will withdraw from the Paris agreement.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-39861589
"Connecticut black bear 'angry' at no invite for brownies A bear in the US state of Connecticut would not take no for an answer after showing up at a homeowner's back porch for fresh-baked brownies. The unwanted ursine guest managed to rip off the screen door, but was unable to open the glass sliding door, even after climbing on to a porch handrail. A neighbour who came into the house in the town of Avon and took these photos said it was ""a harrowing experience"". Bill Belfiore said the black bear refused to be scared off. ""Though it looks cute on the railing, this bear was angry about not being able to get at the food,"" said Mr Belfiore. He told emergency responders: ""We have a bear attempting to get into a house and he's not afraid of noise, screaming or yelling or pounding."" After pawing at the backdoor - which leads to the kitchen - the stubborn bear tried accessing other doors to the home. By the time police responded, the bear had already lost interest and left. Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has advised nearby residents to take steps to ""reduce encounters and potential conflicts"" with black bears. They said the state's bear population has been growing, and that they become more active in the spring time. ""If you genuinely care about bears, you should never feed them - either intentionally or unintentionally,"" DEEP deputy commissioner Susan Whalen said last month. She said bears have lost their fear of humans are more likely to become a ""nuisance"" animal.

"France's Marion Maréchal-Le Pen quits politics for daughter French far-right MP Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, whose aunt was defeated in Sunday's presidential election, has said she is quitting politics for ""personal and political reasons"". She was seen by some as a future leader of the National Front (FN), founded by her grandfather Jean-Marie Le Pen. She said she was giving up because she missed her two-year-old daughter but was not leaving politics for good. Her aunt, Marine Le Pen, won just under 34% in the presidential run-off. She said she regretted her niece's decision, but - ""as a mother"" - she understood why she had taken it. In a letter to her local newspaper in the south-eastern Vaucluse area, Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, 27, explained her decision not to defend her role as one of only two FN MPs in the National Assembly.

"Chelsea Manning confirms her release from prison next week Chelsea Manning has released a statement ahead of her planned release from prison next week. The transgender US army private, born Bradley Manning, is due to be freed on 17 May, after former President Barack Obama commuted her sentence. Manning had been scheduled for release in 2045, after receiving a 35-year sentence for her role in leaking diplomatic cables to Wikileaks. She confirmed the release was going ahead on her Twitter feed on Tuesday. ""Freedom was only a dream, and hard to imagine. Now it's here! You kept me alive <3,"" Manning wrote, linking to a longer statement which referred to some of the treatment she had received behind bars, including ""periods of solitary confinement, and... routinely forced haircuts"".  ""For the first time, I can see a future for myself as Chelsea,"" she said. ""I can imagine surviving and living as the person who I am and can finally be in the outside world."" Manning said she would be ""forever grateful"" to all those who had supported her and President Obama, and now hoped to make ""life better for others"". President Obama commuted her sentence in January, with just three days left in office. The move did not satisfy all her supporters, as some felt she should have been pardoned. A joint statement from her lawyers, Nancy Hollander and Vincent Ward, noted: ""Chelsea has already served the longest sentence of any whistleblower in the history of this country. It has been far too long, too severe, too draconian.  ""President Obama's act of commutation was the first time the military took care of this soldier who risked so much to disclose information that served the public interest."" The US army charged Manning with 22 counts relating to the unauthorised possession and distribution of more than 700,000 secret diplomatic and military documents and videos.  Included in those files was video footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007.  Manning also passed on sensitive messages between US diplomats, intelligence assessments of Guantanamo detainees being held without trial and military records from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The disclosures were considered an embarrassment to the US, prompting the Obama administration to crack down on government leaks.  At a sentencing hearing, Manning apologised for ""hurting the US"" and said she had thought she could ""change the world for the better"". Manning twice attempted suicide last year at the male military prison where she is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. She also went on a hunger strike last year, which she ended after the military agreed to provide her with gender transition treatment.",Wednesday 10 May 2017,10-May-17,Chelsea Manning's 'dream' coming true,"The transgender Wikileaks leaker says she can ""see a future"" as Chelsea for the first time.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39864468
"Quebec's receding floodwaters give up man's body Quebec provincial police have recovered the body of man who was swept away by a swollen river in floods that are feared to have claimed three other lives.  Constable Claude Dorion said a search helicopter spotted the remains of Mike Gagnon, 37, late on Monday.  Mr Gagnon and his stepdaughter went missing on Sunday after their car was swept into the Riviere Sainte-Anne in the Gaspé region of the province.  Ground search crews and divers are still looking for the toddler.  The girl's mother was able to escape the vehicle after it was dragged into the river, but she lost sight of her boyfriend and child.  The fatality comes as flood waters in the deluged province slowly begin to recede and officials urge patience.  ""We are seeing now the start of the decrease of the water levels, but it will take some time before people return to their homes,"" Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said on Tuesday morning.  The central Canadian province is experiencing some of its worst flooding in decades.  More than 170 communities have been affected, 2,733 homes have been flooded,  and 1,940 people have been evacuated, according to the Quebec government.  On Tuesday, Montreal extended its state of emergency until 14 May as a ""preventive measure"", said Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre.  Almost 400 homes have been inundated and 243 have been evacuated to date in the province's largest city.  ""The water levels are stable and we've seen it beginning to recede in some areas. That's a good sign,"" said Mayor Coderre.  A number of schools across the province remained closed for a second day, as did federal government offices in Gatineau, in Canada's national capital region, which has also been inundated.  The Ottawa River reached peak levels on Tuesday and with no significant rainfall expected in the coming weeks, water levels are expected to slowly begin to fall.  Quebec Public Safety Minister Martin Coiteux said it would be ""a number of weeks"" before water levels return to normal.   About 1,730 soldiers and support personnel are in Quebec assisting with sandbagging and protecting critical infrastructure.  Floods have also affected the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia (BC) and New Brunswick. Federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said flooding is still at ""a critical stage"".  One hundred people have been evacuated in Ottawa, Ontario; 30 people in BC; and three in New Brunswick. In BC, the search for two men is ongoing following flooding in parts of the western Canadian province's interior.  Cache Creek Fire Chief Clayton Cassidy, 59, disappeared while checking creek-flow levels in the province's interior late on Friday.

"Kansas man jailed for killing and torturing son he fed to pigs A judge in Kansas has sentenced a man to life after he was convicted of murdering his seven-year-old son, torturing him and recording the abuse. Michael Jones, 46, must serve 25 years for killing his son Adrian. The boy's step-mother, Heather Jones, 31, has already been jailed for the same crime. Officials say Adrian endured horrific torture in his last year of life, and was fed to pigs after his death. A Kansas politician has introduced a law requiring people to report abuse. Representative Louis Ruiz introduced Adrian's Act, which would require family members or residents of the household to report abuse to authorities. Under current Kansas law, only ""mandated reporters"", such as healthcare workers, teachers, social workers, and law enforcement officers are obligated to report abuse. ""If you witness child abuse, I don't care if you're a mandated reporter or not, we should report these things,"" said Adrian's grandmother, Judy Conway, who praised the bill. The little boy's remains were found in a barn on a property rented by the Jones family in November 2015.  He is believed to have died from starvation months earlier. Investigators had gone to the home after receiving reports of domestic abuse. While the couple was awaiting trial, their landlord discovered photos and videos on their computer meticulously documenting the horrific abuse Adrian had endured. During sentencing, Detective Stuart Littlefield choked back tears as he described the final year of Adrian's life, which he said was the worst crime he had seen in his 23-year career. ""Imagine the screams of a 7-year old boy"", Mr Littlefield said describing the abuse. ""And when his killers could no longer stand the stench of his body he was fed to pigs,"" he said.",Wednesday 10 May 2017,10-May-17,US man jailed after feeding son to pigs,A politician pushes for law change after boy suffers years of torture by parents before starvation.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39852497
"Trump 'considered firing Comey since taking office' President Donald Trump had been considering firing former FBI Director James Comey since he was elected, a White House spokeswoman says.  Sarah Huckabee Sanders told media there had been an ""erosion of confidence"" in Mr Comey over the last year.  The administration maintains he was removed on Tuesday for his handling of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry. But US media report Mr Comey recently asked the Justice Department for more resources for his Trump-Russia inquiry. The US Senate Intelligence Committee has invited Mr Comey to testify next week.  The White House is rejecting calls to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate allegations the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin in last year's US presidential election.  ""We don't think it's necessary,"" Ms Huckabee Sanders said on Wednesday. ""No one wants this to be finished and completed more than us.""  In a farewell letter to staff, Mr Comey wrote: ""I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI Director for any reason, or for no reason at all.  ""I'm not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed."" He signed off: ""Working with you has been one of the great joys of my life. Thank you for that gift."" If Donald Trump is trying to avoid comparisons with Richard Nixon's scandal-plagued presidency, welcoming Henry Kissinger - the man probably most closely connected with the former president - in the Oval Office probably isn't the best move. The whole group meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak was a bit strange, starting with the fact that it happened at all. Given the allegations that Mr Trump fired James Comey because of the FBI investigation into Russia ties to the Trump campaign, meeting Moscow's envoy the very next day isn't exactly good optics, as they say. Neither is keeping US media out of the room and having Russian state photographers provide the only public images of the event - images that are sure to feature in Democratic campaign adverts in the not-too-distant future. During the campaign, Mr Trump famously joked that he could shoot somebody, and his supporters would stick by him. Smiling with the Russian ambassador in the midst of a growing Russian hacking controversy is the diplomatic equivalent - a brazen move sans firearms.  Many in Washington will howl, but there's no guarantee it will move the needle among the president's legions. The White House insists it was because of how he handled the investigation into Mrs Clinton's use of private email while she was secretary of state. But many are sceptical that the FBI director would be fired because of actions that have been widely attributed for Mr Trump's shock election victory. The White House spokeswoman said Mr Comey had committed ""atrocities, circumventing the chain of command"" within the Justice Department.  The White House said the ""final catalyst"" was Tuesday's letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein condemning Mr Comey's ""serious mistakes"".  Mr Rosenstein faulted Mr Comey's decision last July to announce the Clinton emails case was closed, and for revealing in October - 11 days before the election - that the inquiry had reopened. The deputy attorney general said Mr Comey's conduct had ""usurped"" the then-attorney general. Unnamed White House officials briefed Reuters news agency that Mr Trump finally lost patience with the FBI director last week over a perceived act of insubordination. They said Mr Comey had refused to preview for top presidential aides his planned testimony to a 3 May Senate hearing on the Clinton email issue. Critics accuse the Republican president of firing the nation's top law enforcement official because he was leading an inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in last year's election. On Wednesday, Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Richard Durbin told US media that Mr Comey had asked the deputy attorney general for more resources - mainly staff - for the FBI investigation. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores called those reports ""totally false"". Either way, Republicans and Democrats vowed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees' investigations into the Russia claims would continue. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said if Mr Trump believed replacing Mr Comey would halt the inquiries ""he made a big mistake"". The president stood by his actions on Wednesday during a surprise meeting with Nixon-era Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Mr Trump said Mr Comey was fired ""because he was not doing a good job"". His remarks preceded a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak - his first with any Russian official since taking power. Mr Trump later tweeted: ""Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved.

"HIV life expectancy 'near normal' thanks to new drugs Young people on the latest HIV drugs now have near-normal life expectancy because of improvements in treatments, a study in The Lancet suggests. Twenty-year-olds who started antiretroviral therapy in 2010 are projected to live 10 years longer than those first using it in 1996, it found. Doctors say that starting treatment early is crucial to achieve a long and healthy life. Charities say there are still too many people unaware they have the virus. This is particularly true in the developing world, where the majority of HIV deaths occur because access to drugs is limited. The study authors, from the University of Bristol, said the extraordinary success of HIV treatments was a result of newer drugs having fewer side effects and being better at preventing the virus from replicating in the body. It is also more difficult for the virus to build up a resistance to the most recent drugs. Improved screening and prevention programmes and better treatment of health problems caused by HIV are thought to have helped, too. But many people with HIV still do not live as long as expected, especially those infected through injecting drugs. Antiretroviral therapy involves a combination of three or more drugs which block the normal progress of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). They have been called ""one of the greatest public health success stories of the past 40 years"". Jimmy Isaacs, 28, discovered he had been infected with HIV by a former partner nearly three years ago. He takes three drugs once a day at 18:00 and will continue to do so for the rest of his life. ""My health is absolutely fine. I'm eating healthily and drinking healthily,"" he said.  ""It doesn't impact on my job and hasn't impacted on my social life either."" Although it took two changes of medication to find the right combination for him, he says he now has no side effects at all. ""I had heard a lot of bad stories about the drugs back in the '90s - but when I did some research, I realised the drugs had completely changed."" Not all his employers have been supportive since his diagnosis and he says that is down to ignorance. His current employer has given him time off to tour the country and speak to students and school pupils about HIV prevention and treatment. The researchers looked at 88,500 people with HIV from Europe and North America who had been involved in 18 studies.  They based their life-expectancy predictions on death rates during the first three years of follow-up after drug treatment was started. They found that fewer people who started treatment between 2008 and 2010 died during this period compared with those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007. The expected age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) after 2008, with a low viral load and after the first year of treatment, was 78 years - similar to the general population.  Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the study showed how much things had changed since the start of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s.  But he said it also meant people aged over 50 now represented one in three of all those living with HIV. ""As it stands, the healthcare, social care and welfare systems simply aren't ready to support the increasing numbers of people growing older with HIV. ""We need a new model of care to better integrate primary care with HIV specialist services, and we need a major shift in awareness and training around HIV and ageing, so that we're ready to help older people live well in later life,"" he said. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: ""It's a tremendous medical achievement that an infection that once had such a terrible prognosis is now so manageable, and that patients with HIV are living significantly longer. ""We hope the results of this study go a long way to finally removing any remaining stigma associated with HIV, and ensuring that patients with HIV can live long and healthy lives without experiencing difficulties in gaining employment and - in countries where it is necessary - obtaining medical insurance."" She said steps were being taken to increase appropriate HIV testing by GPs. The proportion of people with undiagnosed HIV has fallen steadily over the past 20 years. But one in eight people with HIV is still thought to remain undiagnosed.

"Austria convicts asylum seeker of Syria war crimes An asylum seeker has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a court in Austria after being found guilty of killing 20 people in Syria. The 27-year-old man was accused of shooting unarmed or wounded soldiers following a battle in the city of Homs. The man, who has not been named, had denied the charges. He was arrested in western Austria in June.  It is thought to be the first time that a case involving war crimes in Syria has been tried in Austria. The sentence was handed down by a court in Innsbruck, the Austria Press Agency reports. Previous reports in local media said the man had told others at a refugee shelter that he had shot dead government soldiers when he was fighting with an Islamist rebel group called the Farouq Brigade, linked to the Free Syrian Army. But his lawyers said his account of events was mistranslated and that he was expected to appeal against his conviction. According to Der Standard, he is a stateless Palestinian who grew up in a refugee camp in Homs. The suspect was placed under investigation when officials were alerted to his account of events in Syria last year. Austria is unable to extradite the man to face charges in Syria because of the ongoing civil war there. Killing injured soldiers is prohibited under the Geneva Conventions on the laws of war. Officials had previously said the actions that he had allegedly described qualified as terrorism and could be prosecuted under international counter-terrorism agreements. The Geneva Conventions are founded on just a few basic principles:  Medical staff and hospitals in warzones must be protected and allowed to work freely. Those wounded in battle and no longer fighting are entitled to medical treatment. Prisoners of war must be treated humanely. Warring parties are obliged to protect civilians (this includes a prohibition on the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as power and water supplies).

"Suspect in California drink-drive crash 'deported 15 times' A man charged in a drink-driving crash that seriously injured a California boy had been deported to Mexico 15 times in as many years, US officials say. Constantino Banda-Acosta, 38, drove his truck through a stop sign and hit a car carrying a family of three on their way home from a trip to Disneyland. They said they were one block from home when the collision occurred. The six-year-old boy suffered brain trauma and is said to be in a serious condition. The suspect fled but was arrested. The truck hit the rear passenger door of the car on Saturday night in the San Ysidro district of San Diego, close to the US-Mexico border, said the family. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said the suspect had been ""repatriated to Mexico at least 15 times since 2002, most recently in January 2017"". ""[ICE] has lodged a detainer against Mr Banda seeking to take him into custody if and when he is released by local authorities to pursue additional immigration enforcement action and/or criminal prosecution,"" a statement quoted by local broadcaster KGTV added.  He was charged with driving under influence, hit-and-run and driving without a licence.  Another man was also arrested in connection with the crash. The boy is being treated at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego. His father told CBS8 broadcaster of his son: ""Right now he's got a lot of swelling.

"NY cab driver fined for 'price gouging' Canada asylum seekers A New York State cab driver has been fined $2,500 (£1,930; C$3,400) for overcharging asylum seekers for rides to the Canada-US border.  The state's attorney general said he launched a probe after hearing reports cabs were scamming migrants.  Northern Taxi's owner Christopher Crowningshield was caught in a subsequent sting operation.  He later admitted to regularly charging four to six times the normal price for fares heading to the border.  ""Unfortunately, frightened and desperate people are the number one target of scammers,"" Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement on Wednesday.  A growing number of asylum seekers have been illegally crossing into Canada in recent months, mainly into Manitoba, Quebec and British Columbia.  In the first three months of 2017, some 1,860 refugee claimants were intercepted by Canadian law enforcement after making their way into Canada from the US.   Mr Schneiderman said he had been hearing ""troubling"" reports of Plattsburgh-area cabbies overcharging migrants heading to the border, which is a roughly 40-minute journey along Interstate 87 from the New York town.  He sent an investigator to look into those reports.  She hailed a cab - Mr Crowningshield's - at the Plattsburgh bus depot and handed the driver a note asking to be taken to a specific point where people can walk across the border into the Canadian province of Quebec.  Mr Crowningshield agreed to the ride, but refused to answer the investigator's repeated questions about fares.  He only told her the trip would cost $200 well into the journey. He later admitted that he sometimes charged up to $300 for the trip.  Mr Crowningshield has been ordered to pay the fines and penalties, to prominently post rates in his taxi, and to quote clients the fares in advance.  He also cannot charge more than $77.50 for trips from Plattsburg to the border.  Two other cab companies - C&L Taxi and Town Taxi and Medical Transport - were also fined for failing to properly post rates.

"Brazil's ex-President Lula questioned over corruption The former Brazilian President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has given evidence before the country's top anti-corruption judge. He was closely questioned for five hours by Judge Sergio Moro. Lula has rejected allegations that he received a flat as a bribe in a corruption scandal linked to the state oil company, Petrobras.  He says the trial is politically motivated and he has denied any wrongdoing.  The hearing in a courthouse in the southern city of Curitiba was closed to the public but throughout the day thousands of his supporters gathered in a square nearby.  Supporters of the investigation in to the former president gathered elsewhere in Curitiba and in the capital, Brasilia.  If Lula is found guilty he faces a prison sentence. If cleared, he has said he will run again for the presidency. This is the first of five charges against him. Known throughout Brazil simply as Lula, he was Brazil's most popular president during his tenure from 2003 to 2010.  A former steel worker turned union leader, he came to office as the first left-wing leader in Brazil in nearly half a century. Unable to stand for a third consecutive term, he was succeeded by close ally Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached. Profile: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva Lula is facing five charges related to the Car Wash scandal, the nickname for Brazil's biggest ever corruption probe.  This first case, which is being tackled in court on Wednesday, accuses Lula of taking bribes from a construction company that allegedly renovated a beachfront apartment for him.  He is also accused of money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice.  Lula is typically loved or hated in Brazil.  Wednesday will be the first time Lula and the powerful judge in charge of the Car Wash case, Sergio Moro, come face to face in court. Lula says Judge Moro is politically-motivated and believes there is a witch-hunt against him. Mr Moro is expected to hand down his verdict in 45 to 60 days.  Who is judge Sergio Moro? Magazine covers in Brazil this week depict the face-off in epic style: one shows former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and judge Sergio Moro confronting each other in a boxing ring, raising their gloves and boasting muscular torsos in a montage. Another depicts them fiercely looking each other in the eye in superhero masks, announcing ""the first face-to-face confrontation"".  This gives a taste of the huge expectations surrounding Lula's testimony before Judge Moro.  Like a crowd before a boxing match, Brazilians will be split cheering on each contender.  Thousands of Lula's supporters are to rally in the city of Curitiba in his defence. Backers of the Car Wash operation will follow closely to see who has the upper hand.  But Lula won't be speaking to the judge only. He is the front-runner in next year's presidential elections, and his words will doubtless be measured to convey the right message to voters across the country.  Lula could eventually face prison or lose his political rights. But he could still become the next Brazilian president.

"Non-EU parents may have EU residence right, ECJ rules Non-EU citizens may have the right to residence in the EU if their children are EU citizens, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled. It made the judgement in the case of a woman from Venezuela who had a child with a Dutch citizen from whom she has since legally separated. She was denied social welfare and child benefit payments by Dutch authorities. The rights of non-EU citizens in the EU have come to the fore as Britain prepares to negotiate to leave. The European Union says questions about the status of Britons in the remaining 27 EU countries, and of those countries' nationals in the UK, must be resolved as a priority in negotiations.  The ECJ's ""interference"" in national court judgments about migration was cited by some who advocated for the UK to leave the EU.  Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU EU demands 'serious UK response' on citizens' rights Wednesday's ruling concerned a Venezuelan national who came to the Netherlands on a tourist visa. In 2009, she had a child with a Dutch national with whom she lived in Germany until their separation in 2011, when she and the child left the family home and she became responsible for care of her daughter without support from the father. But because she did not have a right to residence, Dutch authorities rejected the mother's application for welfare payments. But the ECJ has now ruled that EU law does not allow a member state to take decisions which block the legal rights of a family member of an EU citizen - in this case, the woman's child, who is a Dutch citizen via her father.  The court argued that any threat to the mother's right to remain in the EU would deprive the child of the ""genuine enjoyment"" of her own rights under European law.  The ruling applies to cases where the child has a relationship of dependency on a parent which means the child would have to leave the territory of the EU if the parent did. That would require assessment of a number of factors including age, the child's development and its emotional ties to each parent. It is now left to the Dutch courts to make a final decision on the individual case involving the family in the light of the decision handed down by the European judges. On Thursday afternoon, the European Parliament will hold a hearing into the rights of EU citizens in the UK.

That was two million fewer than expected, but 36% higher than the same period last year. The news sent shares tumbling more than 20% in after-hours trading in New York.

"General election 2017: Labour manifesto draft leaked A draft of Labour's general election manifesto has been leaked, including plans to nationalise parts of the energy industry and scrap tuition fees. The BBC has seen a copy of the document due to be signed off on Thursday. It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal. The shadow chancellor said the leak was ""disappointing"" but the Tories called it ""a shambles"". Leaving a meeting where about 80 Labour figures were agreeing the final manifesto, shadow minister Jon Trickett told reporters ""an exciting document is emerging"" which would ""speak to the whole country"". According to the draft, Labour would: On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids. First it would introduce an ""immediate emergency price cap"" of £1,000 a year. The draft manifesto also promises to ban fracking and cut the voting age to 16. The document restates the existing policy to renew Trident but commits a Labour government to a defence review which would allow opponents to question the position on the nuclear weapons system. It also says Labour would ""negotiate transitional arrangements to avoid a cliff-edge for the UK economy"" if no Brexit deal was reached during talks with the EU. It is still in the process of being approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said he did not know who was behind the leak, which he called ""disappointing"". He said that the final manifesto was still to be signed off and insisted: ""Every policy will have a costing and a funding source identified."" Mr McDonnell added that a policy of rail nationalisation when train operators' franchises run out ""has been Labour Party policy for a number of years"" and the document's proposals on energy are ""what a lot of modern European states have done over the last five years"". He rejected comparisons with Labour's radical 1983 election manifesto, saying Labour had ""an extremely modern, progressive set of proposals"". The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election.  Andrew Gwynne, Labour's national campaigns co-ordinator, told BBC Breakfast he was taking a positive view about the leak given their policies were being talking about a week ahead of the manifesto launch. The draft document is seen by some senior Labour figures as the most left-wing manifesto since the party was led by Michael Foot in 1983. It certainly appears to be the most detailed in a generation with a 20-point plan for workers' rights alone.  Many individual policies are likely to be popular - not every privatisation is seen as having been a success and polling suggests the commitments to renationalise the railways and cap energy prices are not as controversial as critics would claim.  But opponents and sceptical voters will await further detail behind the assertion that everything has been costed. Privately, many Labour MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn will get the manifesto he wants but in return he must take full responsibility if voters find it less appealing than he does. Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign. These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported. On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called ""bedroom tax"" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21. The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66. The draft was initially leaked to the Daily Mirror and the Daily Telegraph. A Conservative spokesman said: ""This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed. ""The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk."" In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was also extending by two years a pledge to increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation annually. Labour is also promising to meet the 2% Nato pledge. The SNP's Tommy Sheppard said: ""The very fact that this draft manifesto has been leaked shows how divided and chaotic the Labour Party are - most of their MPs do not even support these policies."" Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale was unable to attend Thursday's meeting on Labour's manifesto as it clashed with First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament. Meanwhile, a Welsh Labour spokesman said: ""Reports of leaked manifestos relate to an old, draft version of a UK document.

"IS conflict: Syrian force 'takes town of Tabqa and dam' An alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters has announced it has taken a strategically important town from so-called Islamic State (IS). The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they had ""completely liberated"" the town and its nearby dam, which are 40km (25 miles) west of IS-stronghold Raqqa. It comes a day after the US said it was going to arm members of the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) who are fighting for the SDF. That decision has angered Turkey. It considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the fight against the jihadists should not involve ""another terrorist group"". But Washington disagrees and insists the YPG - which leads the SDF's alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias that has driven the extremists from about 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) of northern Syria over the past two years, with the help of US-led coalition air strikes - is needed to capture IS-held Raqqa. The Pentagon has previously armed only Arab elements of the SDF. YPG spokesman  Redur Xelil said the US decision would ""provide a strong impetus"" to all forces fighting IS, but noted it came ""somewhat late"". If the SDF has been victorious in Tabqa, it will open up a new route to Raqqa, the BBC World Service's Middle East editor Alan Johnston said. The fighting has been raging in the town for weeks, with IS suicide bombers and snipers putting up fierce resistance.  They have been holding out in the northern neighbourhoods, and in the structure of the nearby dam, which the UN had previously warned was risked flooding the area if it was damaged.

In his first interview since firing the FBI director, Mr Trump told NBC News on Thursday he had asked Mr Comey whether he was under investigation. ""I said, if it's possible would you let me know, 'Am I under investigation?' He said: 'You are not under investigation.'"" ""I know I'm not under investigation,"" Mr Trump told the interviewer, repeating a claim he made in Tuesday's letter of dismissal to Mr Comey. President Trump said Mr Comey first told him this at a dinner at the White House, which the FBI chief had requested because ""he wanted to stay on"" in his post under the new administration. But NBC later quoted an unnamed former senior FBI official close to Mr Comey as saying it was the White House that had requested the dinner, and that Mr Comey would not have told the president he was not under investigation. ""He would say, 'look sir, I really can't get into it, and you don't want me to',"" the former official was quoted as saying. The White House has rejected concerns raised by legal experts that the conversation, as described by Trump, may have been improper. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she ""did not see it as a conflict of interest"". According to the New York Times, two people who had heard Mr Comey's account - apparently of the same dinner - said Mr Comey declined a request to pledge loyalty to Mr Trump, but said he would be honest with him.  The president also appeared to undercut the initial White House explanation that he had fired Mr Comey on the recommendation of top justice officials. ""He's a showboat. He's a grandstander. The FBI has been in turmoil.  I was going to fire Comey. My decision,"" Mr Trump said.  White House officials had previously pinned the decision on a memo written by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which Mr Trump refers to in the opening paragraph of his termination letter to Mr Comey, saying, ""I have accepted their recommendation"". But he told NBC: ""I was going to fire him regardless of the recommendation."" On Thursday afternoon, the president took a wrecking ball to the White House's days of work. Oftentimes, it seems like the president and his press office are operating from different playbooks. The president says or tweets what he chooses, and his staff scrambles to explain the context or douse the flames of controversy. It happened when the president boasted about the size of his inauguration crowd, alleged that there were millions of illegal votes in the presidential election and accused Barack Obama of ""wiretapping"" him, among many other instances. On Thursday afternoon it was time to bring out the brooms once again. Read more from Anthony Zurcher: Three takeaways from the NBC interview Mr Trump also denied that he wanted the FBI inquiry on Russia dropped, saying he, instead, wanted it ""speeded up"". ""I want to find out if there was a problem with the election having to do with Russia... or any other country, I want that to be so strong and so good, and I want it to happen."" This is despite saying in a tweet on Monday: ""The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?"" ""There's no collusion between me and my campaign and the Russians,"" he told NBC. Mr Trump said he had just sent a letter via a law firm to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham stating that he has no stake in Russia. ""I have nothing to do with Russia,"" he said. ""I have no investments in Russia. I don't have property in Russia. I'm not involved with Russia."" The White House has depicted the Russia inquiry as ""probably one of the smallest things"" that the FBI has ""got going on their plate"". But acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that it was ""a highly significant investigation"". In testimony to the Senate intelligence committee, he also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of his staff. ""I can confidently tell you that the vast majority of employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,"" Mr McCabe said. The acting FBI director vowed not to update the White House on the status of the investigation and to notify the Senate panel of any attempt to interfere with the inquiry. Republican committee chairman Richard Burr asked Mr McCabe if he had ever heard Mr Comey tell Mr Trump the president was not the subject of investigation.  Mr McCabe said he could not comment on an ongoing inquiry. The acting FBI director did not confirm reports that Mr Comey had asked for more resources for the agency's Russia inquiry. Mr McCabe said he believed the FBI had sufficient funding to conduct the probe.

"Rod Rosenstein: Caught in the James Comey sacking storm After just two weeks in office, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein finds himself suddenly at the centre of the storm over President Donald Trump's sudden sacking of FBI Director James Comey. The White House has cast a memo written by him on Tuesday as the impetus for the move. But critics say the 52-year-old Harvard graduate, with a reputation as straight-shooting and non-partisan, has been sucked into providing cover for Mr Trump to push out a man he desperately wanted rid of. Mr Comey was leading the FBI investigation into alleged Russian interference in the November presidential election, including whether there was co-ordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. And Mr Rosenstein is overseeing that probe, because his own boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has recused himself from it after a row over contacts with the Russian ambassador to the US. Indeed, senior Democrats say they believe Mr Comey had approached the deputy attorney general to request more resources for the investigation just days before the memo was written - although the department of justice has dismissed this as ""false"". Mr Rosenstein received overwhelming bi-partisan support when the Senate voted 94-6 in favour at his confirmation hearing in April. Before that, he had served as Maryland's chief federal prosecutor under President George W Bush. Unusually, he was kept on under President Barack Obama and became the longest-serving US attorney with a 27-year-long career spanning five administrations.  The former Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler described him in a recommendation letter in February as ""totally by-the-book and completely apolitical"". And in that vein, Mr Rosenstein's memo comprises a litany of criticism over Mr Comey's failure to follow rules and procedures. He said it was ""wrong"" of him to ""usurp the attorney general's authority"" in announcing his conclusion that the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails should be closed without prosecution. And he said Mr Comey's decision to hold a press conference, where he ""laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial"" was a ""textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do"".  But Democrats - and others - say the Trump administration, which had previously praised Mr Comey's actions, is using the memo as a smokescreen. Former Deputy Attorney General Donald Ayer, who was quoted in the memo, described the ""firing based it seems entirely on Comey's mishandling of the Clinton investigation"" as ""a sham"". Comey: Four theories for the axe Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Trump's high-profile sackings ""The deputy [attorney general] should realise that his correct assessment of those mistakes is now being used to justify firing for a very different reason,"" he said in a statement. So did President Trump ask Mr Rosenstein specifically to investigate Mr Comey's conduct? When White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked, he initially said ""it was all him"" - of Rosenstein - but then corrected himself. ""I guess I shouldn't say that.... no-one from the White House. That was a DOJ [Department of Justice] decision,"" he said. However, the Washington Post, citing unnamed White House officials, says Mr Trump called Mr Sessions - an ally of his - and Mr Rosenstein to a meeting on Monday and told them to explain in writing the case against Mr Comey. Former justice department official Eric Columbus is among those noting that Mr Rosenstein stopped short of specifically recommending that Mr Comey be fired. He suggested on Twitter that Mr Rosenstein ""thought Comey screwed up but didn't want him fired with Russia investigation pending... yet Sessions wanted a memo on Comey's sins, and Rosenstein felt he had to oblige his boss."" The deputy attorney general must now decide what to do about growing demands from Democrats - and an unusually direct approach from the New York Times editorial board - to appoint an independent special prosecutor to investigate the Russia allegations. Whatever the inside story, it all renders somewhat ironic another line in Mr Gansler's recommendation letter for Mr Rosenstein.

"Is Trump's thin skin getting in the way of his presidency? What if the Comey firing is nothing to do with the Russia probe or the Clinton email server but is actually just a result of the president's thin-skinned character?  And would that be more or less alarming than Comey being fired in order to impede the Russia investigation, which is the case Democrats are making this week?  New reporting from the Washington Post, and other US media outlets, which are the recipients of a huge amount of leaks this week, suggest Mr Trump was upset by the Comey testimony at the Senate last week.  What particularly angered him, the reports say, was Comey saying it made him ""mildly nauseous"" to think the FBI may have swayed the election.  This hit right at President Trump's psychological weak spot - the legitimacy of his victory in the election.  Mr Trump frequently talks up the size of his win in November and often disparages people, or photos, or agencies that suggest he didn't win big. He still does so, six months after the election. But is being thin-skinned now getting in the way of his ability to do his job effectively? The sacking of James Comey might be evidence of that.  Mr Trump hated what he heard in Mr Comey's testimony. It made him angry, he felt disparaged and he hit back. This, we understand, was Mr Trump's MO as a business man.  But the scale now is far larger and he hit back in a way that undermines his credibility (because the story is not straight) and diminishes trust in the institutions of government.   This may be about the Russia probe getting more intense, but there is still no evidence that Mr Trump colluded with Moscow to affect the outcome of the vote. None.  It doesn't look good that the White House fires the man who's in charge of the investigation but it may be just that, unfortunate optics.  But it may simply be about Mr Trump's personality. He doesn't forgive grudges and feels somehow unfairly treated. Then he acts fast, sometimes impulsively, especially when he's angry. At 70 years old, his character is unlikely to change.  If the firing of Mr Comey is an example, it's not a good sign for long-term stability in this White House.",Friday 12 May 2017,12-May-17,Is Trump's thin skin to blame?,"What if the Comey firing is nothing to do with Russia but is down to Trump's character, asks Katty Kay.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39888641
"Arctic summit: Alaskan fears amid the vanishing ice It's springtime in Alaska and a gentle drip-drip and occasional creak and crack tells you that the winter ice on the shore of the Bering Sea is melting fast. In the little town of Nome (""there's no place like Nome,"" as they say here) folk reckon that these thaws are coming earlier, summers are longer and the ice is thinner. To them climate change is not just a theory. ""When I was younger this shore-fast ice was upwards of eight feet,"" says Austin Ahmasuk who has been gazing out at this icy water since the day he was born. ""Now its wintertime maximum is four feet thick or so."" Mr Ahmasuk works with Kawerak, a consortium of 20 local tribes including Inupiaq, St Lawrence Island Yupik and Central Yup'ik peoples - trying to maintain old traditions in a new world. ""In Alaska,"" he says, ""we are witnessing the disappearance of the cryosphere - ice - in many parts where it occurred in all of its forms: permafrost, river ice, ocean ice."" The resulting oceanic changes are, he says, ""mind-blowing"". Trump scraps Obama's climate change policies Trump's 'control-alt-delete' on climate change policy This changing face of land and sea hampers the mobility of isolated communities, making hunting harder and challenging ways of life which have endured for thousands of years. Along the beach, Rebecca Tokeinna and her mother Peggy Olanna are not hunting, but scavenging for flat stones to decorate their new home. It is a few degrees above freezing today and the sun is out so both mother and daughter are wearing shorts. ""It's summer,"" they declare, with broad smiles. They have recently moved south from the Arctic village of Wales from where, on a clear day and in the right spot, you can see Russia across the strait. They too are reporting changes. ""The winters are colder and a little bit shorter and spring is coming earlier and a lot warmer, which we love. Summers are longer instead of shorter,"" says Ms Olanna. The winter which has just ended was particularly fierce, she says, although she adds that it followed several milder winters. ""The elders, they are watching the climate change,"" says Ms Olanna. ""Back in the day they knew exactly when to go out hunting. Now they have to play with the weather."" There is no doubt that people here are tough and resilient. Through the long, dark winters when ferocious storms scream in from the sea, survival is not guaranteed and there is no-one to turn to for help. And yet now, with conditions changing so rapidly, there is a feeling that help may be needed, that local problems are becoming global concerns. Halfway across Alaska, climate change is the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks which brings together the foreign ministers of the eight nations with territory in the Arctic along with representatives of indigenous communities. Many delegates here say they are confused about the position of the United States which, under the administration of the previous president, Barack Obama, a Democrat, made tackling climate change a priority. Most significantly Mr Obama approved the 2015 Paris climate change accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was negotiated by around 200 nations. His successor in the White House has taken an altogether different approach. Before becoming president Donald Trump tweeted that climate change was a Chinese hoax. He has appointed a former chief executive of the oil major Exxon Mobil as secretary of state. The Environmental Protection Agency is now being run by a fierce critic of Obama-era climate policies and the White House has caused consternation with executive orders which could lead to the production of more coal and more oil and gas exploration. The biggest question remaining is whether President Trump will go even further and withdraw the US from the Paris accord. Doing so would set back US climate policy ""by a decade or two"", in the judgment of Prof John Walsh, chief scientist for the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska, amounting, he says, to ""an abdication of responsibility"".  ""The warming we've seen in the last 50 to 100 years is greater than the warming we've seen at any time in the last 2,000 years,"" says Prof Walsh, adding that ""human activity is a primary driver of the changes we're seeing"". Scientists like Prof Walsh say the effects of a warming climate are being felt particularly keenly here in the Arctic - with sea ice and glaciers melting, permafrost thawing and coastal communities at threat from erosion. Not only that but the process appears to be accelerating thanks to a so-called feedback loop - the more ice melts, the darker the surface of the planet becomes, with both land and sea reflecting less sunlight and absorbing more heat, and the warmer the world becomes. The climate is not the only topic on the table at the Arctic Council. It also deals with issues such as fisheries, tourism and shipping. Finland, which is taking over the presidency from the US for the next two years says its twin priorities will be addressing climate change and ensuring sustainable development. Helsinki will also have to contend with the prospect of increasing tensions in the High North where retreating ice is raising the prospect of a scramble for resources. Analysts say Russia now has its strongest military presence in the region since the end of the Cold War. ""A lot depends on the so-called global drivers, the prices of commodities: oil, gas, minerals,"" says Prof Walsh, who predicts that ""sooner or later, when the commodity prices do trend back upwards, the Arctic is going to be more ripe for exploitation."" There are plenty of people in Alaska who have voiced support for such development, but back on the beach in Nome, Peggy Olanna is worried. ""I would say no, that would affect our food from the ocean and we depend on that,"" she says.",Friday 12 May 2017,12-May-17,Alaskan fears amid the vanishing ice,"James Cook reports from Nome, Alaska, with climate change high on the agenda at an Arctic summit.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39887133
"Ex-wife gets £453 million divorce payment A Russian billionaire has been ordered to pay his estranged wife £453m in a divorce settlement at a British court. The payment from the 61-year-old, a former oil and gas trader, to his ex-wife, 41, has been described as one of the biggest awards made by a UK court. During a High Court hearing, a judge said the couple met and married in Moscow before moving to Surrey. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said he had awarded the woman 41.5% of the ""total marital assets"". The judge made a ruling preventing the man, from the Caucasus, and the woman, who was born in Eastern Europe, from being identified. Both were given indefinite leave to remain in the UK, where they have lived for a number of years. Nearly five years ago, the court was told, the husband sold shares in a Russian company for $1.3 billion (£1bn).  He then bought both the couple's sons flats in a luxury London development - one for £29 million and the other for £7 million.  Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the woman had been a housewife and mother to the couple's children. The husband argued he had made a ""special contribution"" to the generation of wealth, but the judge concluded the man and woman had made ""equal contributions to the welfare of the family"". His ex-wife claimed the ""total net marital wealth"" was just over £1 billion which had been built up during their marriage.  Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the reasons for the man's ""sudden decision"" to no longer contest the case were ""unclear"", but it seemed that he had previously argued that he was wealthy before they married. Neither party was in court for the final ruling.  In 2014, Jamie Cooper-Hohn, wife of financier Sir Chris Hohn, was awarded more than £330 million.  Legal experts said the Cooper-Hohn award was ""certainly"" one of the biggest made in the UK, although divorce proceedings are often conducted in private hearings.

Of those, 1,095 were confirmed as gang members, ICE said, while the remaining 238 ""were arrested on either criminal or administrative charges"". More than 900 of the arrested were US citizens. Acting director Thomas Homan said ""violent criminal street gangs are the biggest threat facing our communities"". The Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit carried out the operation, its largest to date. ICE said it was targeting gang members and ""associates"" involved in cross-border criminal activity - including drug and weapons smuggling, sex trafficking and murder. During the six-week operation, 238 firearms were seized, alongside almost 600lb (270kg) in mixed drugs, and almost half a million dollars in cash.

"Lana, the world's 'saddest dog', needs another home Lana the Labrador, once dubbed the saddest dog in the world, may have found a third lease on life.  In 2015, the dog found a home after a Canadian animal adoption group posted a heartrending photo of the young lab mix that went viral. The second owner recently returned Lana, so the rescue group said she was again up for adoption and had until 20 May before possibly being put down.  They have since been flooded with some 5,000 emails and adoption offers.  ""I'm sure we're going to find her a place,"" said Brenda Dobranski from Rescue Dogs Match in Cambridge, Ontario. ""Third time's a charm.""  The organisation admitted ""there is still work to be done"" despite ""tons"" of training when it comes to Lana's behaviour. They say she should ideally be able to spend the bulk of her time outdoors because she is ""skittish"" inside.  Ms Dobranski described Lana as being a bit like a cat in that she preferred to keep her distance.  ""When you see Lana she reminds you of the type of dog you want to hug and cuddle on the couch with,"" she said.  ""She's not that type of dog. She's very touch sensitive from humans, she's just learning now that it's OK to play with other dogs. Right now the trainer that she's been living with can pet her on the head for a few strokes but then you see her body tense up.""  Lana's story first made headlines in 2015 when the dog rescue group posted about how she ""shut down"" after being placed in a kennel. Her first adoptive family surrendered her after snapped at one of the owners over food.  She found a foster family and then a second adoptive home, but that too was short-lived.  While she is described a ""loving and silly"", she can be cautious around new people and ""possessive"" with her food, a behaviour that developed when she was a puppy and the runt of the litter.  Rescue Dogs Match says she needs a home with no other pets and no children, and a fenced in backyard. Lana turns three years old this month.  Ms Dobranski  said that while Lana's story has tugged on people's heartstrings since first being featured on The Dodo, a website geared towards animal lovers, it is important not to adopt a pet simply out of emotion.  ""People just want to save, and that's great - it's absolutely wonderful. But it has to be the right fit for the people as well as other pets and that specific dog,"" she said.  Lana was first brought to Canada as a rescue puppy from Mexico.  Ms Dobranski says her story helped Rescue Dogs Match raise C$15,000 (US$11,000/£8,500) for the organisation in 2015, funds that went towards medical bills and boarding for all their rescues.

Madeline Connelly, a 23-year-old from Chicago, and her dog Mogie had been missing in the Great Bear Wilderness area near Glacier National Park. Apart from being hungry and tired, she was not injured and asked rescuers if she could hike back with them. She was airlifted to a nearby hospital and has been reunited with her family. Her family said that she is an experienced hiker, and that they knew she would eventually be found safe.

"France's Macron announces gender equal list of political outsiders The party of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron has selected a diverse list of 428 candidates for parliamentary elections next month. Only 24 of those chosen are outgoing MPs from the current parliament.  Some 52% come from civil society and exactly half are women, the secretary-general of La République En Marche (Republic on the Move) said. Richard Ferrand said the choices marked ""the definitive return of citizens to the heart of our political life"". Mr Macron still needs to select more than 100 candidates for the 577-seat parliament and the party says its door is open to politicians from other parties to join. The movement received more than 19,000 applications, Mr Ferrand said at a news conference, with 1,700 telephone interviews conducted with candidates. The average age of the list is 46 ""compared to 60 years for the average of outgoing MPs"", he said. The youngest candidate is 24 years old, while the oldest is 72. Around 10 candidates are unemployed, double that are retired and a handful are students. All of the outgoing MPs chosen to run come from the Socialist Party of departing President François Hollande. Mr Ferrand confirmed that Mr Macron's ex-cabinet colleague Manuel Valls - the former prime minister who has now burned his boats with his Socialists - had not been selected. He said that he did ""not meet the criteria"" because he had already served three parliamentary terms. But the party will not be running a candidate against him in his constituency in Essonne, south of Paris. France had been waiting to see if the party list would live up to Mr Macron's pledge to clean up France's public life. Many of the candidates are unknown to the public and there are few well-known personalities on the list. Among the diverse candidates is Cédric Villani, a famous mathematician with a penchant for flamboyant bow-ties and spider brooches. He won the Fields Medal - seen as one of the highest honours in mathematics - in 2010. François Hollande's communications advisor Gaspard Gantzer, former judge Éric Halphen and former bullfighter Marie Sara are also on the list. Although no MPs of the Republican party are candidates, at least two former allies of Alain Juppé - who lost the centre-right party's presidential primary - have been selected. It has escaped no-one's attention that there are nearly 150 names still missing. Why this lack of clarity? Why the delay? Why is Mr Macron's party unable to do what it said it would do and give the country the full roster of names? The answer is that it is engaged in some very old-style political calculation. Emmanuel Macron knows that his weak point is his connection with the outgoing regime. He is a socialist at heart, as he has often said, and made his name serving a Socialist Party president.  If his party goes into the election fielding too many ex-Socialist MPs, it will be a sitting target for a vengeful Republican Party, eager to get its own majority and force the new president into a ""cohabitation"" (where the government is of a different colour from the president). So the party wants a few more days to tempt over Republican Party defectors. Only in the middle of next week will it draw up its definitive list. Read more from Hugh Some of the names previously announced include: French media are already reporting errors on the list - including one candidate with a criminal record (the party said no-one with a criminal record would be eligible). Several people on the list have also denied they are candidates. Mr Macron was only elected on Sunday and the two-round parliamentary vote takes place on 11 and 18 June. But with only one month to go, every political party is now focusing on the race for the National Assembly.

"France's Macron announces gender equal list of political outsiders The party of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron has selected a diverse list of 428 candidates for parliamentary elections next month. Only 24 of those chosen are outgoing MPs from the current parliament.  Some 52% come from civil society and exactly half are women, the secretary-general of La République En Marche (Republic on the Move) said. Richard Ferrand said the choices marked ""the definitive return of citizens to the heart of our political life"". Mr Macron still needs to select more than 100 candidates for the 577-seat parliament and the party says its door is open to politicians from other parties to join. The movement received more than 19,000 applications, Mr Ferrand said at a news conference, with 1,700 telephone interviews conducted with candidates. The average age of the list is 46 ""compared to 60 years for the average of outgoing MPs"", he said. The youngest candidate is 24 years old, while the oldest is 72. Around 10 candidates are unemployed, double that are retired and a handful are students. All of the outgoing MPs chosen to run come from the Socialist Party of departing President François Hollande. Mr Ferrand confirmed that Mr Macron's ex-cabinet colleague Manuel Valls - the former prime minister who has now burned his boats with his Socialists - had not been selected. He said that he did ""not meet the criteria"" because he had already served three parliamentary terms. But the party will not be running a candidate against him in his constituency in Essonne, south of Paris. France had been waiting to see if the party list would live up to Mr Macron's pledge to clean up France's public life. Many of the candidates are unknown to the public and there are few well-known personalities on the list. Among the diverse candidates is Cédric Villani, a famous mathematician with a penchant for flamboyant bow-ties and spider brooches. He won the Fields Medal - seen as one of the highest honours in mathematics - in 2010. François Hollande's communications advisor Gaspard Gantzer, former judge Éric Halphen and former bullfighter Marie Sara are also on the list. Although no MPs of the Republican party are candidates, at least two former allies of Alain Juppé - who lost the centre-right party's presidential primary - have been selected. It has escaped no-one's attention that there are nearly 150 names still missing. Why this lack of clarity? Why the delay? Why is Mr Macron's party unable to do what it said it would do and give the country the full roster of names? The answer is that it is engaged in some very old-style political calculation. Emmanuel Macron knows that his weak point is his connection with the outgoing regime. He is a socialist at heart, as he has often said, and made his name serving a Socialist Party president.  If his party goes into the election fielding too many ex-Socialist MPs, it will be a sitting target for a vengeful Republican Party, eager to get its own majority and force the new president into a ""cohabitation"" (where the government is of a different colour from the president). So the party wants a few more days to tempt over Republican Party defectors. Only in the middle of next week will it draw up its definitive list. Read more from Hugh Some of the names previously announced include: French media are already reporting errors on the list - including one candidate with a criminal record (the party said no-one with a criminal record would be eligible). Several people on the list have also denied they are candidates. Mr Macron was only elected on Sunday and the two-round parliamentary vote takes place on 11 and 18 June. But with only one month to go, every political party is now focusing on the race for the National Assembly. His recently rebranded party is only 13 months old and Mr Macron needs to show he will have not just a mandate but the power in parliament to push through his programme. Nearly 20,000 people applied and a few thousand only added their names in the past few days following the election.

"EU's Barnier will 'work to avoid' Brexit hard border The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has emphasised there will have to be some form of customs controls between NI and the Republic after Brexit. Michel Barnier was addressing at a joint session of the Irish houses of parliament in Dublin.  He is the first non-head of state or prime minister to make such an address. Mr Barnier told Irish parliamentarians he had a duty to speak the truth and that the ""UK's departure from the EU would have consequences"". He said the Irish border issue would be one of his three priorities in negotiations. But he emphasised that customs controls were part of EU border management. The British and Irish governments have both said they do not want a return to customs posts on the border. The EU's negotiating guidelines call for a ""flexible and creative"" approach to the customs issue. They also state that issues relating to the Irish border will have be resolved in the first phase of its talks with the UK. No solid plans have yet been advanced by either the EU or the UK. Mr Barnier said that whatever happened in negotiations, ""nothing should put peace at risk"". He added that he wanted to ""reassure the Irish people"" that in the Brexit negotiations the Republic of Ireland's interest will be the EU's interest. Mr Barnier said the EU wants the negotiations with the UK to succeed.   ""We will need to negotiate a 'bold and ambitious', but fair, free-trade agreement,"" he said.  Addressing Mr Barnier in the joint committee, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams told him he wanted to see a border poll within the next five years. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) has described Brexit as being bad bad for the UK, for Europe and the Republic of Ireland. Enda Kenny said it challenges Ireland's peace and prosperity, although he said the country would maintain its close relationship with the UK. The Republic of Ireland's economy is particularly vulnerable to any new tariff or regulatory barriers with the UK, which may arise as a result of Brexit. The chief economist of the Irish Central Bank has warned that within 10 years of a ""hard Brexit"", the number of people employed would be 40,000 fewer, compared with a no-Brexit scenario. Gabriel Fagan said that some small and medium-sized Irish businesses are ""likely to be among the hardest hit by Brexit"". Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the speaker of the Dáil (Irish parliament), said Mr Barnier's address was ""timely and appropriate"" given that Brexit ""could have a greater impact on Ireland than any on other EU state"". ""As legislators there is an onus on us to be fully informed on the implications of Brexit on this country in particular and on the EU in general and to communicate our particular concerns on Brexit,"" he added.

"Copenhagen imam accused of calling for killing of Jews A video of an imam appearing to call for the murder of Jews in a sermon during Friday prayers at a Copenhagen mosque has caused outrage in Denmark. Mundhir Abdallah was reported to police after being filmed citing in Arabic a hadith - a teaching of the Prophet Muhammad - considered anti-Semitic.  The hadith says the Day of Judgement ""will not come unless the Muslims fight the Jews and the Muslims kill them"". A Jewish community leader said his words were a ""thinly-veiled"" threat.  Videos of the sermon were posted on YouTube and Facebook by the Al-Faruq Mosque on Sunday, although Mr Abdallah reportedly gave it on 31 March. A part of the 30-minute address was later translated by the Washington-based Middle East Media Research Institute (Memri). In the video, Mr Abdallah is seen standing in front of a black flag with the Shahadah written on it, similar to those used by jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda. He declares there will soon be a ""caliphate"" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia - that will wage jihad to unite the Muslim community and liberate the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem ""from the filth of the Zionists"". Then, he says, ""the words of the Prophet Muhammad will be fulfilled"" and cites the hadith. Jewish community leader Dan Rosenberg told the Politiken newspaper: ""We are concerned weak and impressionable people may perceive this kind of preaching as a clear call to violence and terror against Jews."" Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg also expressed outrage. ""This is completely preposterous, undemocratic and awful,"" the centre-right Venstre politician wrote on Facebook. ""But it also shows why we need to lead a harsh and consistent policy. We cannot and should not accept this!""",Friday 12 May 2017,12-May-17,Outrage at Danish imam's 'threat to Jews',A video emerges showing a Copenhagen imam citing a hadith that calls for Muslims to kill Jews.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39885745

  Seven brothers and sisters adopted by same couple after four years in care
  
From the topic Life
 
    11/05/17
   Seven brothers and sisters who spent nearly four years in care have been adopted by the same couple. Maria, Elizabet, Guillermo, Jason, Kristina, Katerin and James have been adopted by Josh and Jessaka Clark in Georgia, US. The siblings were in care for 1,359 days before the couple's adoption process was completed on 9 May 2017. Josh and Jessaka started the process two years ago and the children lived with the couple for the past 10 months. The couple already had one biological son, Noah, and refer to the new additions as their ""super seven"". Jessaka has posted photos of the happy family on her Facebook page and shared several updates on their progress. ""My husband Josh and I both knew that we wanted to adopt children. We had decided this before we even met each other,"" Jessaka told Fox News. ""Josh has a heart for the thousands of children that don't have parents and knew he wanted to bring some of them into his home."" That home looks likely to get even bigger after the couple raised more than $20,000 (£15,500) on Go Fund Me in less than 24 hours to expand their property to make more rooms for the family. Their fundraising page also states that the couple plan to take in more children. Jessaka says she was inspired to adopt children by her parents and she has two adopted brothers of her own. After the Clark's story was covered in US media, Jessaka says she hopes they would inspire others. ""We are truly blessed to be able to show people the beauty in adoption and shed light on the need for foster and adoptive parents,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. She also shared photos from a school visit on 10 May to change the children's names.

"Massive ransomware infection hits computers in 99 countries A massive cyber-attack using tools believed to have been stolen from the US National Security Agency (NSA) has struck organisations around the world. Cyber-security firm Avast said it had seen 75,000 cases of the ransomware - known as WannaCry and variants of that name - around the world. There are reports of infections in 99 countries, including Russia and China. Among the worst hit was the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Scotland. The BBC understands about 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled. The malware spread quickly on Friday, with medical staff in the UK reportedly seeing computers go down ""one by one"".  NHS staff shared screenshots of the WannaCry program, which demanded a payment of $300 (£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files for each computer. Throughout the day other, mainly European countries, reported infections. Some reports said Russia had seen more infections than any other single country. Domestic banks, the interior and health ministries, the state-owned Russian railway firm and the second largest mobile phone network were all reported to have been hit. Russia's interior ministry said 1,000 of its computers had been infected but the virus was swiftly dealt with and no sensitive data was compromised. In Spain, a number of large firms - including telecoms giant Telefonica, power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural - were also hit, with reports that staff at the firms were told to turn off their computers. People tweeted photos of affected computers including a local railway ticket machine in Germany and a university computer lab in Italy. France's car-maker Renault, Portugal Telecom, the US delivery company FedEx and a local authority in Sweden were also affected. China has not officially commented on any attacks it may have suffered, but comments on social media said a university computer lab had been compromised. Read more: Who has been hit by the NHS cyber attack? Explaining the global ransomware outbreak A hack born in the USA? Coincidentally, finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthiest countries have been meeting in Italy to discuss the threat of cyber-attacks on the global financial system. They are expected to release a statement later in which they pledge greater co-operation in the fight against cyber-crime, including spotting potential vulnerabilities and assessing security measures. The infections seem to be deployed via a worm - a program that spreads by itself between computers. Most other malicious programs rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. By contrast, once WannaCry is inside an organisation it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too.  Some experts say the attack may have been built to exploit a weakness in Microsoft systems that had been identified by the NSA and given the name EternalBlue. The NSA tools were stolen by a group of hackers known as The Shadow Brokers, who made it freely available in April, saying it was a ""protest"" about US President Donald Trump. At the time, some cyber-security experts said some of the malware was real, but old. A patch for the vulnerability was released by Microsoft in March, which would have automatically protected those computers with Windows Update enabled. Microsoft said on Friday it would roll out the update to users of older operating systems ""that no longer receive mainstream support"", such Windows XP (which the NHS still largely uses), Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003. The number of infections seems to be slowing after a ""kill switch"" appears to have been accidentally triggered by a UK-based cyber-security researcher tweeting as @MalwareTechBlog. He was quoted as saying he noticed the web address the virus was searching for had not been registered - and when he registered it, the virus appeared to stop spreading. But he warned this was a temporary fix, and urged computers users to ""patch your systems ASAP"". Many jobs can be done using software everyone can buy, but some businesses need programs that perform very specific jobs - so they build their own.  For example. a broadcaster might need specialist software to track all the satellite feeds coming into the newsroom, and a hospital might need custom-built tools to analyse X-ray images. Developing niche but useful software like this can be very expensive - the programming, testing, maintenance and continued development all adds up.   Then along comes a new version of Windows, and the software isn't compatible. Companies then face the cost of upgrading computers and operating system licenses, as well as the cost of rebuilding their software from scratch. So, some choose to keep running the old version of Windows instead. For some companies, that is not a huge risk. In a hospital, the stakes are higher.",Saturday 13 May 2017,13-May-17,Ransomware infects computers worldwide,"The National Health Service in England declares a major incident; the US, China and Russia are also hit.",http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39901382
"FBI chief sacking: White House denies Comey loyalty pledge The White House has denied reports that President Donald Trump asked fired FBI Director James Comey to pledge loyalty to him.  Press secretary Sean Spicer rejected US media reports that the president sounded out Mr Comey at a private White House dinner in January. According to the New York Times, Mr Comey said he would offer the president honesty, but not loyalty. Mr Trump has faced a backlash for dismissing Mr Comey on Tuesday. The FBI probe and parallel congressional investigations into alleged Russian political meddling, and whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the Kremlin, have dogged his young presidency. The search for a new FBI director is beginning on Saturday, with four possible candidates being interviewed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In Friday's daily briefing, Mr Spicer refused to comment on questions about whether Mr Trump had been making surreptitious recordings in the White House. Mr Trump tweeted hours earlier that Mr Comey had ""better hope there are no tapes"" of their conversations. Mr Spicer denied the tweet was a threat. ""The president has nothing further to add on that,"" he told reporters repeatedly when pressed about the post. ""The tweet speaks for itself"". However, Mr Comey believes ""if there is a tape, there is nothing he is worried about"", a source told CNN. Mr Trump's comments provoked fresh comparisons between his administration and that of disgraced President Richard Nixon, who famously recorded conversations, speeding his downfall during the Watergate scandal. Why is Watergate in the news again? The top Democrats on the House judiciary and oversight committees wrote to the White House on Friday demanding copies of any recordings. John Conyers and Elijah Cummings' letter noted ""it is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony"". Donald Trump was reportedly unhappy with how his press team handled fallout from Tuesday's decision to fire Mr Comey, so he's taken things into his own hands. Boy, has he. First he gave an interview that essentially undercut all the arguments White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, had made to paint the Comey sacking as an operation conducted through normal channels. Now he has taken to Twitter in earnest, spraying a barrage of allegations, accusations and aggressions against Democrats, the media and Mr Comey himself. In sports terms, the strategy could be described as ""flooding the zone"" - launching a ferocious, full-out assault to overwhelm an opponent's defences. In this case, Mr Trump has the media scrambling to decide which story merits the most coverage. Is it the details of the Comey-Trump dinner and the president's hints of secret ""tapes""? His threat to cancel press briefings? The Oval Office visit by a Russian entourage? Perhaps, as Mr Trump suggests, the ""real news"" is the tentative trade agreement between the US and China on beef and poultry products? When everything is a big story, nothing is. At least, that's what Mr Trump may hope. Mr Comey has declined an invitation to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee next Tuesday. President Trump told NBC News that Mr Comey requested the one-on-one dinner, but the former FBI director reportedly maintains it was the president who invited him. Mr Comey had said he was ""uneasy"" before the dinner, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. He told MSNBC on Friday that he had spoken to Mr Comey before the White House meal. The FBI chief had confided he was concerned it might compromise his Trump-Russia inquiry, said Mr Clapper. Mr Trump has said Mr Comey told him three times he was not a target of the FBI inquiry, fuelling accusations the president was interfering in the investigation. Still chafing at media coverage of the firing, Mr Trump tweeted on Friday: ""Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future 'press briefings' and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???"" Mr Spicer said the president was a ""little dismayed"" that his press team's attempts to give out information were being turned into a ""game of gotcha"" by the media. Mr Trump made the point more forcefully in an interview with Fox News by threatening to hold the press briefings only once a fortnight, with himself at the podium. ""Unless I have them every two weeks and I do them myself, we don't have them,"" he said. ""I think it's a good idea. First of all, you have a level of hostility that's incredible and it's very unfair.""",Saturday 13 May 2017,13-May-17,White House denies FBI boss loyalty vow,The press secretary also refuses to comment on if Mr Trump is making surreptitious recordings.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39901641
"Venezuela protests: Elderly clash with police in opposition march Thousands of elderly Venezuelans have taken to the streets of Caracas and other cities to protest against the government of Nicolas Maduro amid a worsening economic crisis.  Police blocked access to a main road in the capital and used pepper spray to try to control the crowd.  Protesters threw punches and demanded respect from police.  Venezuela is facing a shortage of many basic items, including medicines and medical equipment.  Many feel that elderly people have been particularly affected by the crisis in the health system. In another development, Mr Maduro has sacked his health minister after she released official figures showing a sharp rise in child mortality and maternal deaths over the past two years.  Antonieta Caporale, a gynaecologist, had been in the post for only four months and was replaced by the Vice-Minister of Hospitals, Luis López. ""I'm here to defend my grandchildren, to defend my country,"" 78-year-old Rafael Colmenares told Reuters news agency during the demonstration in Caracas. ""Respect the elderly,"" many demonstrators shouted. A university town, Merida is used to student protests. But on Friday, a steady stream of pensioners marched to the public prosecutor's office. One elderly man summed up their grievances: ""The government is killing us in three ways. We're dying of lack of food, we're dying of lack of medication and they're killing us at the protests."" Another woman held up a sign reading: ""Today I'm turning 60 and for the first time I don't have enough for a cake."" Florentino Montilba, 75, said he was taking to the streets because ""this is the last option they've left us with"".  ""If need be, we'll die here on the streets,"" he said. The march was diverted but it eventually reached the office of Venezuela's ombudsman, where the protesters accused the security forces of brutal suppression.  At least 39 people have been killed since the current wave of protests began six weeks ago. The unrest was triggered by a Supreme Court attempt to take over powers from the opposition-controlled National Assembly on 29 March.  It reversed its decision a few days later, but by then the opposition had seized the momentum. To maintain pressure on President Maduro, opposition leaders have begun organising themed marches. Last Friday, they urged women to take to the streets. There was a candle-lit march. And Friday's protest was dubbed ""The Grandparents March"". The government responded with a rival march to show support to Mr Maduro, with thousands of pro-government elderly people taking to the streets of Caracas. The opposition is calling for fresh presidential elections. Mr Maduro says they are trying to create unrest to unsettle his democratically-elected socialist government and seize power.",Saturday 13 May 2017,13-May-17,Grandparents protest in Venezuela,"Pepper spray is used against ""Grandparents March"" in Caracas during anti-Maduro protests.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39903878
"Costa Concordia captain's sentence upheld by Italy court Italy's highest court has upheld the 16-year jail sentence given to the captain of the Costa Concordia, which capsized in 2012 killing 32 people. Francesco Schettino had handed himself in to the Rebibbia prison in Rome after the verdict, his lawyer said. Schettino was sentenced in 2015 after a court found him guilty of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident and abandoning ship. The cruise ship capsized after hitting rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio. Schettino was nicknamed ""Captain Coward"" by the media, after the coastguard released recordings of him in a lifeboat resisting orders to return to the stricken vessel.  More than 4,000 people were aboard at the time and were forced into a chaotic evacuation. Prosecutors say he steered too close to the island to show off to a dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who was with him at the helm. But he blamed communication problems with the Indonesian helmsman.  The court ruling was welcomed by a lawyer representing relatives of the victims, who said it represented justice at last. The sentence included 10 years for manslaughter, five for causing the shipwreck, one for abandoning the ship before passengers and crew were clear, and one month for lying to the authorities afterwards.  Costa Crociere, the company that owned the ship, sidestepped potential criminal charges in 2013 by agreeing to pay a €1m ($1.1m; £769,000) fine. Five of Schettino's colleagues were also jailed for up to three years in earlier cases.",Saturday 13 May 2017,13-May-17,Costa Concordia captain's sentence upheld,Italy's highest court confirms the captain of the ill-fated cruise ship will be jailed for 16 years.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39903968
"Ebola: WHO declares outbreak in DR Congo The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. At least one person has died after contracting the virus in the country's north-east, the WHO says. The Congolese health ministry had notified the WHO of a ""lab-confirmed case"" of Ebola, it added on Twitter. More than 11,000 people died in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015, mainly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The last outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo was in 2014 and killed more than 40 people. Of the nine people suspected to have contracted the deadly virus, three died, with one case of Ebola confirmed through tests at the national laboratory in the capital Kinshasa, WHO Congo representative Allarangar Yokouide said in a statement. People began to get sick on or after 22 April in Bas-Uele province in the country's far north, he added. The region affected lies 1,300km (800 miles) north-east of Kinshasa, close to the border with the Central African Republic. ""It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky. But we always take this very seriously,"" WHO Congo spokesman Eric Kabambi told Reuters news agency. The WHO described the outbreak as ""a public health crisis of international importance"". It said the first teams of experts, including epidemiologists, biologists and hygiene specialists had been dispatched and were due to arrive in the affected region by Friday or Saturday.  While this outbreak will be extremely worrying for communities in this remote part of northern DR Congo, it is important to remember that the country has stamped out more Ebola outbreaks than any other place on earth. It is well practiced in fighting the deadly virus.  Ebola was first identified in DR Congo (then Zaire) in 1976. Since then, there have been at least eight in the country. The last was in 2014, when - at the same time - parts of West Africa were fighting a separate outbreak, the worst in history.  DR Congo was able to bring an end to its epidemic within four months. In West Africa, which had never experienced an Ebola outbreak before, it took two years.   Authorities in the DR Congo will need to act quickly to contain the virus, and ensure it doesn't spread to more populated areas.  This time, for the first time, health officials have another weapon they can use. The world has an experimental vaccine that could be deployed if needed.

"West Bromwich Albion 0-1 Chelsea By Phil McNulty Chief football writer at The Hawthorns 
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Chelsea were crowned Premier League champions as Michy Batshuayi's late goal gave them the victory they required to secure the title at West Brom. It looked as though Antonio Conte's side might be forced to delay their celebrations as they were frustrated for long periods by the resilience and organisation of their hosts. But the mood changed and the title was won with eight minutes left as substitute Batshuayi, who had previously endured a season of struggle after his £33m move from Marseille, ended a scrappy passage of play by steering a finish high past Ben Foster. The final whistle sparked wild celebrations among Chelsea's fans, and manager Conte was tossed high into the air by his squad.  The Italian can now set his sights on emulating compatriot Carlo Ancelotti's 2010 feat of winning the league and domestic Double as the Blues prepare for an FA Cup final against Arsenal at Wembley on 27 May. Chelsea's celebrations were fully deserved - the culmination of a superb season's work by Conte and his squad. They had to work hard for victory against a West Brom side that demonstrated all the qualities that have made this such a satisfactory season for them but, as so often, Chelsea got the job done. The Blues' main attacking threats struggled to find a spark, with Eden Hazard's frustration summed up with one long-range shot that went out for a corner, but Conte's side found a way to win, illustrating once again why they are worthy champions. The losses at home to Liverpool and at Arsenal in September that hinted at early struggles seemed an age away, as did the surprise defeat by struggling Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge, and the setback at Manchester United. Chelsea, even when not at their best, proved themselves the strongest and most complete side in the Premier League - and they proved it again on a night they were tested.

                         Conte's fingerprints are all over this title triumph - and his sure touch was on show again to fashion the victory they needed to get over the line with two games to spare. The Italian knew his side needed a catalyst to break down West Brom, and it came with the introduction of Batshuayi and Willian for Hazard and Pedro with 15 minutes left. Conte's masterstroke should have come as no surprise given the manner in which he has marshalled his forces, particularly the crucial switch to a three-man defence in September that turned Chelsea's season around and started a run of 13 straight league wins that led to the title. No praise is too high for the 47-year-old, who took over a squad that looked broken after ending last season in 10th place and with the shadow of Jose Mourinho's sacking still hanging over the club. This was his ultimate reward.

                         Batshuayi has been a misfit for much of this season, but whatever the future holds for the 23-year-old Belgian, he will always have a goal that won the title to his name. Before this game, he had only figured only 24 times, played for 579 minutes and scored five goals - his sixth makes its mark in Chelsea history.

"Iran election: Fierce exchanges in final TV debate Angry exchanges have erupted during the final televised debate before Iran's presidential election next week. President Hassan Rouhani accused one of his rivals of abusing religion to win power and another of wanting to beat up students. In return he was accused of corruption, economic mismanagement and failing to bring any benefits from a landmark nuclear deal. Mr Rouhani is seeking a second four-year term in next Friday's election. Although seen by some as a reforming figure, Mr Rouhani has cast himself more as a moderate pragmatist working within the establishment. It was, however, clear that the reformist vote remained an important focus, given the three hours of fierce exchanges with hardline opponents. Cleric Ebrahim Raisi, seen by some as a protégé of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a former Republican Guard commander and police chief, were his main targets. Mr Rouhani said: ""Mr Raisi, you can slander me as much you wish. As a judge of the clerical court, you can even issue an arrest order. But please don't abuse religion for power."" The president attacked Mr Qalibaf's handling of protests when police chief in the late 1990s and early 2000s. ""You wanted to beat up students,"" Mr Rouhani said. His opponents focused on his failure to make economic progress despite the lifting of some sanctions following the 2015 agreement with global powers on the curbing of Iran's nuclear programme. Mr Qalibaf said: ""The country is facing an economic crisis, with unemployment, recession and inflation. A tree that has not borne any fruit in four years will not yield anything positive in the future."" Mr Raisi said 250,000 small businesses had closed and he called for an increase in cash payments to the poor. Mr Rouhani insisted money was becoming available for investment and that he would work to lift the remaining sanctions. But the fiercest clashes were on corruption. Mr Raisi alleged Mr Rouhani had blocked an inquiry into corruption charges against relatives and claimed some of his ministers were linked to illegal imports. The president was also accused of receiving heavily subsidised public properties. Mr Rouhani in turn alleged public funds had been diverted to Mr Raisi's campaign, adding:  ""Some security and revolutionary groups are bussing people to your campaign rallies... Who finances them?"" He also said that if he had published a dossier he had obtained in 2005 on Mr Qalibaf ""you would not be sat here today"". The other three candidates are Eshaq Jahangiri, Mostafa Hashemitaba and Mostafa Mirsalim. All the candidates have been screened for their political and Islamic qualifications by the Guardian Council, made up partly of clerics. If no candidate wins 50% of the vote on 19 May, there will be a run-off between the top two one week later.",Saturday 13 May 2017,13-May-17,Fiery exchanges in Iran election debate,Rivals trade allegations of corruption ahead of next Friday's presidential election.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39902987
"US to discuss with EU possible laptop ban on flights US and EU officials are due to discuss the possible extension of a US ban on laptops and tablets in cabin baggage when they meet in Brussels next week. It comes after US Homeland Security said it was considering extending to Europe an existing ban for flights from eight mostly Muslim countries. The ban was introduced over fears a bomb could be concealed inside electronic devices. An EU spokeswoman said no decision had been made yet. How do the rules affect me? ""The EU invited the US to come to Brussels next week for talks at political and expert level... to jointly assess the potential risks and review future measures,"" the spokeswoman said. However, she added that in a telephone call, EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc had highlighted ""the potential safety implications of putting a large number of electronic devices in the aircraft hold"". In March, the US banned devices ""larger than a smartphone"" from the cabins of flights from Turkey, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. At the same time, the UK issued a similar ban on flights from six countries. On Thursday, US Homeland Security Department Secretary John Kelly held talks with officials from several US airlines.  The airlines declined to comment on the meeting but one official quoted by Reuters news agency said the government was suggesting that an expansion of the ban could come soon. A congressional official also said the ban was likely to be expanded, but would not say when or to which airports. Some European regulators have warned that the ban itself could compromise safety by placing hundreds of devices in the cargo holds on long-haul flights. They say the presence of so many lithium-ion batteries could increase the risk of fire.",Saturday 13 May 2017,13-May-17,US to discuss laptop flight ban with EU,The ban already affects flights to the US from eight mainly Muslim countries.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39905479
"Al-Nahyan trial: UAE princesses accused of servant abuses Eight Arab princesses are on trial in Brussels for trafficking and abusing servants during a stay there. Sheikha Hamda al-Nahyan and her seven daughters hired a floor of rooms at a luxury hotel over eight months in 2008.  They brought with them from the United Arab Emirates a retinue of more than 20 servants whom they are accused of holding in conditions close to slavery. The plaintiffs say they were prevented from leaving the hotel and forced to eat the princesses' leftovers. The princesses are being tried in absentia along with an Indian butler. If found guilty, they could face hundreds of thousands of euros in damages and even a prison sentence - but rights activists say it is highly unlikely that the UAE would extradite them to serve time behind bars. Nonetheless, it would be ""hugely significant"" if one of the wealthiest families in the world was publicly linked with trafficking and slavery, says Nicholas McGeehan, an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf for Human Rights Watch. He argues that despite being abolished in law, domestic slavery continues in Gulf states - ""perpetuated by ruling elites for whom it serves an important societal purpose in conferring status"". He added: ""It's top-down and tolerated."" The princesses deny the charges, and their defence said the facts of the case had been, at the very least, greatly exaggerated. ""There are stories that do not hold up,"" the lawyer said. The case came to court on Thursday and was hearing from defence lawyers on Friday morning. The case came to light when one of the servants escaped from the hotel. One of the alleged victims told Belgian television that the women were detained in hotel rooms with private guards and prevented from going outside.  They had to be available to take orders 24 hours a day, slept on the floor in the princesses' rooms and forced to eat the princesses' leftovers. One who complained is alleged to have been deprived of food and water for three days. As well as charges of inhumane treatment, the princesses are also accused of failing to procure the correct visas and work permits for their servants as well as failing to pay wages. Legal challenges to proceedings by the defence have meant the case has taken nine years to get under way. They have challenged, for instance, whether the police had a legal mandate to enter the princesses' hotel suites. The case was cleared to go to court in 2012, but the case has been stalled by procedural challenges, Stef Janssens told the BBC. He works for Belgian rights organisation Myria which has been supporting the alleged victims. ""The princesses are of course very important people with immense means and prestige, while the victims are very vulnerable,"" he said.  ""The princesses hired three specialist lawyers who twice went to Belgium's highest court to challenge procedure. Not everyone has the means to do that."" The princesses carried out the alleged abuses in the same year that Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed, another member of the UAE's al-Nahyan ruling family, bought Manchester City football club.

"Karabo Mokoena murder: Suspect charged in South Africa court The man believed to be the boyfriend of a 22-year-old woman, whose killing has shocked South Africa, has been charged with her murder at a court in Johannesburg. Karabo Mokoena's mother wept as she arrived at the hearing.  A widespread online campaign to find Ms Mokoena was called off on Wednesday when her father confirmed her death. The case has sparked a fierce debate about the levels of violence faced by women in South Africa.

"Colombia Farc: First group of rebels rejoin civilian life Twelve rebels from Colombia's Farc group have been reintegrated into civilian life, after becoming the first group to complete a UN-monitored disarmament process.  The 12 men received certificates from the UN mission at a ceremony in Bogota.  Thousands of rebels have handed over their weapons since the Farc signed a peace agreement with the government last year. The deal put an end of more than five decades of conflict.  Some 7,000 members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) are still at demobilisation zones set up across Colombia, waiting to be registered so they can rejoin civilian life. Friday's event marked the beginning of ""a continuous process begins to certify the Farc members who are making the transition to civilian life after laying down their arms,"" the UN said in statement. The historic peace accord was reached after four years of negotiations held in the Cuban capital, Havana. Under its terms, all weapons should have been handed over by 1 May, but the UN says there have been delays.

"Stayin' Alive: Bee Gees hit free to German first aiders German schools can now play the Bee Gees hit Stayin' Alive without charge to help children learn emergency heart massage. The German music rights body Gema told an MP, Roy Kühne, that the hit could be played during first aid lessons in his town, Clausthal-Zellerfeld.  Gema's fee waiver is expected to be valid for other schools in Germany too. The disco rhythm of Stayin' Alive is good for heart massage, the British Heart Foundation says.  Some other pop hits have also been recommended. In a letter to Mr Kühne, seen by the BBC, Gema said it understood that the school lessons - for up to 30 students - did not count as public performances, so no royalties had to be paid. But Stayin' Alive could only be played licence-free to groups in school buildings during first aid classes, it stressed. The MP had sought Gema's permission on behalf of first aid instructors in his region. He is a trained rescue swimmer himself. German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Yellow Submarine by the Beatles and Madonna's Like A Prayer were also good for life-saving heart massage. The technique is also known as Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). With 100-120 beats per minute Highway to Hell, by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, would also qualify - but its title is not life-affirming, the newspaper notes. The British Heart Foundation used Stayin' Alive in a video featuring the footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones, demonstrating how to help people who had suffered a heart attack.

"Cyber-attack: Europol says it was unprecedented in scale A cyber-attack that hit organisations worldwide including the UK's National Health Service was ""unprecedented"", Europe's police agency says. Europol also warned a ""complex international investigation"" was required ""to identify the culprits"". Ransomware encrypted data on at least 75,000 computers in 99 countries on Friday. Payments were demanded for access to be restored. European countries, including Russia, were among the worst hit. Although the spread of the malware - known as WannaCry and variants of that name - appears to have slowed, the threat is not yet over. Europol said its cyber-crime team, EC3, was working closely with affected countries to ""mitigate the threat and assist victims"". In the UK, a total of 48 National Health trusts were hit by Friday's cyber-attack, of which all but six are now back to normal, according to the Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The attack left hospitals and doctors unable to access patient data, and led to the cancellation of operations and medical appointments. Some reports say Russia has seen more infections than any other country. Banks, the state-owned railways and a mobile phone network were hit. Russia's interior ministry said 1,000 of its computers had been infected but the virus was swiftly dealt with and no sensitive data was compromised. In Germany, the federal railway operator said electronic boards had been disrupted; people tweeted photos of a ticket machine. France's carmaker Renault was forced to stop production at a number of sites. Other targets have included: Coincidentally, finance ministers from the G7 group of leading industrial countries had been meeting on Friday to discuss the threat of cyber-attacks. They pledged to work more closely on spotting vulnerabilities and assessing security measures. Read more: 'I was the victim of a ransom attack' Who has been hit by the NHS cyber attack? Explaining the global ransomware outbreak A hack born in the USA? The malware spread quickly on Friday, with medical staff in the UK reportedly seeing computers go down ""one by one"".  NHS staff shared screenshots of the WannaCry programme, which demanded a payment of $300 (£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files for each computer. The infections seem to be deployed via a worm - a program that spreads by itself between computers. Most other malicious programs rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. By contrast, once WannaCry is inside an organisation it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too.  It is not clear who is behind the attack, but the tools used to carry it out are believed to have been developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to exploit a weakness found in Microsoft's Windows system. This exploit - known as EternalBlue - was stolen by a group of hackers known as The Shadow Brokers, who made it freely available in April, saying it was a ""protest"" about US President Donald Trump. A patch for the vulnerability was released by Microsoft in March, which would have automatically protected those computers with Windows Update enabled. Microsoft said on Friday it would roll out the update to users of older operating systems ""that no longer receive mainstream support"", such Windows XP (which the NHS still largely uses), Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003. The number of infections seems to be slowing after a ""kill switch"" appears to have been accidentally triggered by a UK-based cyber-security researcher tweeting as @MalwareTechBlog. But in a BBC interview, he warned that it was only a temporary fix.  ""It is very important that people patch their systems now because there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us,"" he said. 'Accidental hero' - by Chris Foxx, technology reporter The security researcher known online as MalwareTech was analysing the code behind the malware on Friday night when he made his discovery. He first noticed that the malware was trying to contact an unusual web address but this address was not connected to a website, because nobody had registered it. So, every time the malware tried to contact the mysterious website, it failed - and then set about doing its damage. MalwareTech decided to spend £8.50 ($11) and claim the web address.  By owning the web address, he could also access analytical data. But he later realised that registering the web address had also stopped the malware trying to spread itself.  ""It was actually partly accidental,"" he told the BBC. Blogger halts ransomware 'by accident' Have you or your company been affected by the cyber-attack?

"Global cyber-attack: Security blogger halts ransomware 'by accident' A UK security researcher has told the BBC how he ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious ransomware that has affected hundreds of organisations, including the UK's NHS. The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, had taken a week off work, but decided to investigate the ransomware after hearing about the global cyber-attack. He managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code. ""It was actually partly accidental,"" he told the BBC, after spending the night investigating. ""I have not slept a wink."" Although his discovery did not repair the damage done by the ransomware, it did stop it spreading to new computers, and he has been hailed an ""accidental hero"". ""I would say that's correct,"" he told the BBC. Cyber-attack scale 'unprecedented' NHS 'robust' after cyber-attack ""The attention has been slightly overwhelming. The boss gave me another week off to make up for this train-wreck of a vacation."" The researcher first noticed that the malware was trying to contact a specific web address every time it infected a new computer. But the web address it was trying to contact - a long jumble of letters - had not been registered. MalwareTech decided to register it, and bought it for $10.69 (£8).  Owning it would let him see where computers were accessing it from, and give him an idea of how widespread the ransomware was. By doing so, he unexpectedly triggered part of the ransomware's code that told it to stop spreading. Analysis: How did it start? What is the ransomware? This type of code is known as a ""kill switch"", which some attackers use to halt the spread of their software if things get out of hand.  He tested his discovery and was delighted when he managed to trigger the ransomware on demand. ""Now you probably can't picture a grown man jumping around with the excitement of having just been 'ransomwared', but this was me,"" he said in a blog post. MalwareTech now thinks the code was originally designed to thwart researchers trying to investigate the ransomware, but it backfired by letting them remotely disable it. While the registration of the web address appears to have stopped one strain of the ransomware spreading from device-to-device, it does not repair computers that are already infected.  Security experts have also warned that new variants of the malware that ignore the ""kill switch"" will appear. ""This variant shouldn't be spreading any further, however there'll almost certainly be copycats,"" said security researcher Troy Hunt in a blog post. MalwareTech warned: ""We have stopped this one, but there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us. ""There's a lot of money in this, there is no reason for them to stop.

""unfazed"", the broadcaster 1+1 TV said. Neil Smith Entertainment reporter The noise in the press room at Kiev's International Exhibition Centre was deafening as Salvador Sobral from Portugal became his country's first ever Eurovision winner. To say the 27-year-old is a popular victor is an understatement. Where others brought slick precision sheen and dancing gorillas to the contest, he brought heart, sincerity and a simple, guileless charm. He also brought something of a sob story - a recent bout of ill health and a serious heart condition. Yet it would be an injustice to him and his songwriting sister Luisa to suggest that sentiment was behind his triumph. He is, simply put, one of a kind - an antidote of sorts to Eurovision's history of short-lived fads and trashy kitsch, and all the more refreshing for it. A journalist I know choked up when discussing how he felt when he saw Salvador sing Amar Pelos Dois (Loving for the Both of Us). Sobral entered the contest with the stated aim of making ""people outside of Portugal know and recognise
my work."" Job done, sir. Here's how the final scores looked after the jury and public votes were added together - with Portugal winning by a clear margin.

"FBI chief sacking: Comey replacement could be appointed 'next week' US President Donald Trump says he could announce a replacement for fired FBI Director James Comey by late next week. He told reporters it was ""possible"" he could name someone by Friday, before he leaves for his first foreign trip. Defence lawyer Alice Fisher was the first candidate interviewed at the justice department, US media report. Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia and Republican Senator John Cornyn also met Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Eleven people are reportedly being considered for the position, which requires confirmation in the Senate.  President Trump has faced a backlash for sacking Mr Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election. He told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted to move quickly to find a new FBI director. ""I think the process is going to move quickly because almost all of them are very well-known, they've been vetted over their lifetime essentially,"" he said. Fox News quoted a government source as saying they were moving ""quickly and expeditiously"" to find a replacement, adding: ""We're doing our due diligence - we are not going to cut any corners."" Mr Cornyn, the Texas Senator, is the second highest-ranking member of the Senate and a former Texas Attorney General. Mr McCabe was the FBI's deputy director until he stepped up after the abrupt departure of his boss. He appeared to contradict the White House this week when he described the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election as ""a highly significant investigation"". He also cast doubt on White House claims that Mr Comey had lost the confidence of FBI staff. Ms Fisher was an assistant attorney general for the justice department's criminal division. She currently works at a law firm. The other candidate widely named in the US press is New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia, a former New York prosecutor.  Although reports initially said just those four candidates were on Saturday's interview list, the Associated Press now says that Adam Lee, the head of the FBI's office in Richmond, Virginia, turned up at the justice department as a candidate. Meanwhile, President Trump is facing growing questions about whether he secretly recorded his conversations with Mr Comey after he appeared to tweet a thinly veiled threat to the former FBI director. He said Mr Comey ""better hope there are no tapes"" of their conversations at a private White House dinner in January during which the president claims Mr Comey assured him he was not being investigated over alleged links to Russia.  In an interview with Fox News, Mr Trump said that he did not want to discuss the matter and that all he wanted was for Mr Comey to be honest. He previously told NBC News that Mr Comey had requested the one-on-one dinner, but the former FBI director reportedly maintains it was the president who invited him. Mr Comey had said he was ""uneasy"" before the dinner, according to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.  On Friday, the White House denied reports that President Trump had also asked Mr Comey to pledge loyalty to him, and that he responded he would offer the president honesty, but not loyalty. Mr Trump travelled on Saturday to Virginia to speak at Liberty University, an evangelical Christian institution founded by the late conservative televangelist Jerry Falwell. The US president enjoys an approval rating from white evangelical protestants that is nearly double his approval rating with the general public, according to the Pew Research Center.  He did not mention the controversy around Mr Comey in his speech to graduates, though he did exhort students to challenge the establishment and ""relish the opportunity to be an outsider"".  Mr Trump's behaviour in recent days regarding Mr Comey has provoked fresh comparisons between his administration and that of disgraced President Richard Nixon, who famously recorded conversations, speeding his downfall during the Watergate scandal. Senior Democrats on the House judiciary and oversight committees wrote to the White House on Friday demanding copies of any recordings. John Conyers and Elijah Cummings' letter noted ""it is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony"".",Sunday 14 May 2017,14-May-17,Trump to 'move quickly' on FBI director,"Interviews have begun as President Trump looks to replace the man he sacked, James Comey.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39906069
"Turkey tourist bus falls from cliff, killing 23 At least 23 people have died after a tourist bus fell from a cliff near the southern Turkey seaside resort of Marmaris. Another 11 were injured when the driver lost control of the minibus and ploughed through a crash barrier. Local media said no foreign tourists were among the passengers. Turkish media said the vehicle was heading towards Marmaris for a mother's day event, which is celebrated on Sunday there. The victims are believed to be mainly women and children. Amric Cicek, governor of Mugla province, suggested the brakes may have stopped working. But the mayor of Marmaris, Ali Acar, told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet: ""I think that the accident was a result of driver error."" Turkey's Anadolou news agency said the crash took place on the Mugla-Antalya road at the Sakar Gecidi pass.

"Pope Francis canonises two children at Portugal's Fatima shrine Pope Francis was greeted by crowds of hundreds of thousands as he made saints of two shepherd children at the Fatima shrine complex in Portugal. ""We declare the blissful Francisco Marto and Jacinta Marto saints,"" the pontiff said to loud applause. It is 100 years since the two - and a third child - reported seeing the Virgin Mary while tending sheep. The third is also on the way to sainthood. Portugal boosted security and re-imposed border controls temporarily. Some 500,000 worshippers gathered in the town of Fatima, north of Lisbon, for the ceremony on Saturday, the Vatican said in a statement. Roman Catholic pilgrims converged on the Fatima Sanctuary from countries as far away as China, Venezuela and East Timor. The town's local bishop first read out the request for the two ""little shepherds"" to be canonised before the Pope declared them both saints of the Catholic Church. Earlier on Saturday, the official Twitter account of the Pope posted a message with reference to the Virgin Mary. ""Whenever we look to Mary, we come to believe once again in the revolutionary nature of love and tenderness,"" it said. The pontiff also met Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa for a private meeting ahead of the ceremony.  On Friday, Pope Francis flew into Fatima in a helicopter and travelled through the town in his ""Popemobile"".  At a candle-lit vigil he called for harmony between all people at the Chapel of the Apparitions and spoke of wars ""tearing our world apart"".  The chapel is built on the very spot where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared. Two of the children - Jacinta and Francisco Marto - have been canonised for the miracles attributed to them. They died in the 1918-1919 European influenza pandemic. The so-called three secrets of Fatima were written down by their cousin, Lucia dos Santos, who died in 2005 aged 97. The beatification process for her began in 2008. The Church attaches great value to their visions, as Mary is believed to have revealed truths to help mankind. The Church says the first vision came on 13 May 1917.  In a video message to the people of Portugal, the Pope said he was going to present himself to Mary ""and I need to feel you close, physically and spiritually, so that we are one heart and one mind"". They are prophecies written down by Lucia, years after the apparitions that the three said they had witnessed. She spent her adult life as a nun at a convent in Coimbra. The first two secrets in Lucia's account were revealed in 1942.  According to Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, the visions described in the three secrets are ""meant to mobilise the forces of change in the right direction"". They are not like the Bible - a text he describes as a ""public revelation"".  The Fatima visions are ""private revelations"", he writes. Their purpose is ""to help live more fully"" in accordance with Christ's teaching. The late Pope John Paul II was shot by a Turkish gunman on 13 May 1981.  He believed that his survival was due to Mary's divine intervention, and that the third secret had predicted the attack on him. John Paul donated the bullet to Fatima, and it was inserted into the crown adorning a statue of Mary there. He follows John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who also made pilgrimages to the Fatima Sanctuary.  Security was high at the site, with Portugal deploying 6,000 police and emergency workers. Concrete blocks were placed on approach roads, to stop any terrorist ""ramming"" attack with a vehicle. Only nine border crossings remained open, with systematic checks, as Portugal temporarily suspended the Schengen open borders pact.  Local accommodation over the weekend was far more expensive than usual, as hotels and residents cashed in on the papal visit.

"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau brings his toddler to work Prime Minister of Canada and internet darling Justin Trudeau has shown the rest of the world's leaders how to do publicity once again - by bringing his three-year-old to the office. A prime minister's business never stops - his official itinerary for the day included a national caucus meeting, questions in the House of Commons, and a meeting with the university presidents. But he still found time for hide-and-seek. Little Hadrien Trudeau literally had the run of the place - illustrious marble corridors and all - and stole the show in a series of photos posted to social media. The duo were also photographed handling the press and politicians - distracting both groups from their serious work. ""So precious ... I'm old enough to remember seeing photos released of you and your dad [former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau] when you were little,"" one Facebook commenter volunteered. ""Whether it's good for PR or not, you can't call Mr Trudeau anything but a family man,"" another wrote. Of course, it's not the first time the 45-year-old internet-savvy politician has caught global attention. The liberal politician has been applauded by his supporters for supporting Syrian refugees, marching at a gay pride parade, and openly declaring himself a feminist.

"North Korea 'would hold talks' with Trump administration North Korea has said it will hold talks with the US ""if the conditions were right"", South Korean media reports. A senior North Korean diplomat said dialogue with the Trump administration was possible following a meeting with ex-US government officials in Norway. Earlier this month US President Donald Trump said he would be ""honoured"" to meet Kim Jong-un. The comments follow months of rising tensions over North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programme. Choe Son-hui, an official in the North Korean foreign ministry responsible for North American affairs, told reporters in Beijing that bilateral talks between Pyongyang and Washington would be considered.  The BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans says North Korea would probably have to agree to at least discuss relinquishing or limiting its nuclear weapons for the US to participate. Ms Choe, who has been involved in nuclear negotiations in the past, made the comments during a stop-over on her return to Pyongyang following a meeting in Oslo. Mr Trump has previously said that he would like to solve the North Korea crisis diplomatically, but that a ""major, major conflict"" is possible. The country has engaged in several military shows of strength in recent weeks including missile tests. The US has responded by sending warships to the region to install a controversial anti-missile system in South Korea.

"Georgia death row inmate seeks execution by firing squad A death row inmate in the US state of Georgia is applying to be executed by firing squad on the grounds that lethal injection would be too painful for him. J W Ledford Jr has been taking a drug for nerve pain which his lawyers say may change his brain chemistry and expose him to ""unconstitutional pain"". Ledford was convicted of the 1992 murder of his neighbour. A judge dismissed his lawsuit on Friday but the lawyers say they will appeal. The execution is scheduled for Tuesday. The lawyers said in court papers that Ledford had taken the drug gabapentin for more than a decade. They cite experts who say long-term exposure to gabapentin alters the brain in such a way that the lethal injection drug pentobarbital cannot be relied upon to make him unconscious and devoid of sensation or feeling. ""There is a substantial risk that Mr Ledford will be aware and in agony as the pentobarbital attacks his respiratory system, depriving his brain, heart, and lungs of oxygen as he drowns in his own saliva,"" the court papers said. They said this would violate Ledford's rights under the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution, which prohibits ""cruel and unusual punishment"". However, the US Supreme Court requires that an alternative method of execution be offered. US death sentences fall to 40-year low Only three states allow for firing squad as an alternative to lethal injection - Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah.  Georgian law allows no alternative. Other methods of lethal injection are no longer available as manufacturers of many drugs have prohibited their use for capital punishment. This has led Ledford's lawyers to argue that his ""dilemma illustrates why [the Supreme Court] standard is unworkable"".   Lawyers for the state of Georgia said there was ""no substantial risk"" of severe pain and questioned the timing of the lawsuit. ""Plaintiff has waited until the eve of his execution to suddenly claim that he has been treated for pain with medication that will allegedly interfere with his execution,"" they said in court papers.

"Ivory Coast: Soldiers cut off second city Bouaké Angry soldiers have blocked off access to Bouaké, the second largest city in the Ivory Coast, as a revolt over a pay dispute continues. One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were ""ready to fight"" if attacked.  Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened ""severe disciplinary sanctions"" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said.  The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks.

"Michelle Obama attacks Trump school meals policy Michelle Obama has launched a fierce defence of the healthy eating initiatives she championed as first lady. At a public health summit in Washington, she hit back after the Trump administration loosened nutritional standards aimed at making US school lunches healthier. ""Think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap,"" she said. One in five American children is obese, government figures show. In thinly-veiled criticism of the policies of the new administration, Mrs Obama told the audience: ""This is where you really have to look at motives, you know.  ""You have to stop and think, why don't you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you? And why is that a partisan issue? Why would that be political? What is going on?"" She added: ""Take me out of the equation - like me or don't like me. But think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap.  ""Why would you celebrate that? Why would you sit idly and be okay with that? Because here's the secret: If someone is doing that, they don't care about your kid."" While in the White House, Mrs Obama championed the ""Let's Move"" campaign, which encourages exercise and healthy eating among young people. The 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act made federal grants for school meals conditional on reductions in calories, sodium and trans fat content and increases in fruit, vegetables and whole grains. However, earlier this month, US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue postponed reductions in sodium, relaxed requirements for whole grains and allowed sweetened flavoured milk back.

"Ransomware cyber-attack threat escalating - Europol Friday's cyber-attack has affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries, Europol chief Rob Wainwright says. He told the BBC the act was ""unprecedented in its scale"" and warned more people could find themselves affected on Monday morning. The virus took control of users' files, demanding payments; Russia and the UK were among the worst-hit countries. Experts say another attack could be imminent and have warned people to ensure their security is up to date. Mr Wainwright said that the ransomware - software that blocks access to data until a ransom is paid - was combined with a worm application - a program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. This, he said, was allowing the ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"".  He added: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time."" Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the ransomware, he said. Companies need to make sure they have updated their systems and ""patched where they should"" before staff arrived for work on Monday morning, the EU law enforcement agency head said.  In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, GP surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected. What occurred was an ""indiscriminate attack across the world on multiple industries and services"", Mr Wainwright said, including Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry. However, he said that so far ""remarkably"" few payments had been made by victims of the attack. BBC analysis of three accounts linked with the global attack suggests the hackers have been paid the equivalent of £22,080. The Europol chief said his agency was working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to find those responsible, and that more than one person was likely to be involved. The virus exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software, first identified by the US National Security Agency, experts have said.  After taking computers over, it displayed messages demanding a payment of $300 (£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock files and return them to the user.  Microsoft released security updates last month to address the vulnerability, with another patch released on Friday. The UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".  MalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.  The 22-year-old told the BBC it was very important for people to patch their systems as soon as possible.",Monday 15 May 2017,15-May-17,Cyber-attack threat escalating - Europol,The EU police chief warns that more people could find themselves affected on Monday morning.,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39913630
"Ivory Coast: Army launches operation 'to restore order' after mutiny Ivory Coast's military says it has launched an operation to ""restore order"" after three consecutive days of protests by mutinous soldiers. The soldiers took to the streets in several cities over a pay dispute and blocked off the second largest city, Bouaké, on Saturday. They have said they are willing to fight if the army intervenes. Popular opposition to the rebellion has been growing, culminating in a march against the soldiers in Bouaké. Six people were wounded when the soldiers opened fire on protesters during Saturday's demonstration. In a statement released at 1700 GMT on Sunday announcing that a military operation was underway, armed forces' chief of staff General Sékou Touré said many of the mutinous soldiers had listened to earlier calls for them to stand down.

"Emmanuel Macron inauguration: French president vows new start Emmanuel Macron has promised to restore France's global standing, as he was inaugurated as the country's youngest president at the age of 39. At an elaborate ceremony at the Élysée Palace in Paris, he said his presidency would ""give the French back the confidence to believe in themselves"". He vowed to see the EU ""reformed and relaunched"" during his time in office. He takes over from François Hollande, whose five-year term was plagued by high unemployment figures. Mr Macron was proclaimed France's new president a week after his resounding victory over the National Front's Marine le Pen, with 66% of the vote in the run-off poll. The former investment banker, who had never contested an election before and only formed his centrist movement a year ago, has vowed to shake up the country's political order and reinvigorate its economy. Tight security was in place across Paris for the ceremony at the president's official residence, with hundreds of extra police on patrol. France has been under a state of emergency since terror attacks in 2015 and a large section of the city centre was closed to traffic all morning. During his inaugural address on Sunday, President Macron pledged to restore the confidence of the French people in their country's future. ""The division and fractures in our society must be overcome,"" said the centrist politician. ""The world and Europe need more than ever France, and a strong France, which speaks out loudly for freedom and solidarity,"" he declared. He said he would convince the people that ""the power of France is not declining - that we are on the brink of a great renaissance"". Speaking later during a visit to the capital's town hall, President Macron praised the way Parisians had responded to terror attacks.  He said that rather than hide behind barricades, many had opened their doors and offered help ""because the face of Paris is the face of France, that of a living fraternity"". He also promised to strongly support the city's bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games. He was presented with a chain of office once worn by Napoleon I, as a symbol of his position as Grand Master of the Legion of Honour (a title usually given to the leader of France). Before the inauguration ceremony began, he spent nearly an hour with his predecessor, who handed him the country's nuclear codes. It was Mr Hollande who launched the new president's political career, appointing him first as adviser and later economy minister.  Despite historic low approval ratings, the former president tweeted after leaving the palace: ""I leave a country in a much better state than I found it.""  It was interesting to note how many ""re-"" words Emmanuel Macron used in his address. There was ""re-formulate"",  ""re-invent"", ""re-mould"", ""re-juvenate"", ""re-launch"". And of course ""re-naissance"". It was all intended to ""re""-enforce the message that this presidency will be one of  newness, youth and optimism. Mr Macron is one of nature's optimists. Francois Hollande - the man from whose hands he took the reins of power - said that when Mr Macron worked for him, he ""radiated joy"". An almost preternaturally sunny demeanour, combined with his winning way with words, has been the new president's magic formula. But to hold presidential office is to walk a road of thorns. Rarely is there good news to smile at. Success - if it comes at all - may only be appreciated years later. Mr Macron's ""re-splendent"" personality is about to tested like never before.    At 39, Mr Macron is France's youngest leader since Napoleon and the first to be born after 1958, when a presidential system was set up. His En Marche political movement was formed just last year and as a new party - La République En Marche - will be fielding candidates across France in June's parliamentary elections. He has promised to ""work for everyone"" and sees his programme as straddling both left and right. Mr Macron's first week in office will be busy. He heads for Berlin on Monday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel and to demonstrate his commitment to the European Union. He is also expected to name a prime minister on Monday morning. Mr Macron faces major challenges including high unemployment, especially among France's young, and low growth. He says his main aims are to boost investment and to set up a ""new growth model"" that increases social mobility and helps the environment.",Monday 15 May 2017,15-May-17,Macron promises French 'renaissance',"The victor in last week's vote says the world needs France more than ever, as he is inaugurated.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39912104
"North Korea missile test 'due to Kim Jong-un paranoia' The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has accused North Korean leader Kim Jong-un of being in a ""state of paranoia"", following another ballistic missile test. The test was a message to the South days after a new president took office, she told ABC News. The US would continue to ""tighten the screws"" on North Korea, Ms Haley said. Japanese officials say the missile, which launched from north-western Kusong, reached an altitude of 2,000km. South Korea's newly elected President Moon Jae-in, who is seeking deeper engagement with the North, said it was a ""reckless provocation"". US President Donald Trump has called for ""stronger sanctions"" against North Korea, while China is urging restraint. A series of North Korean missile tests this year - which are banned by the UN - has sparked international alarm and raised tensions with the US. Two missile launches last month both failed, with the rockets exploding just minutes into flight. North Korea recently said it would hold talks with the US ""if the conditions were right"", after President Trump said he would be ""honoured"" to meet Kim Jong-un under the right circumstances. But Ms Haley said launching missiles was not the way to get a meeting. ""Until he meets our conditions, we're not sitting down with him,"" she said. Stephen Evans: Is Kim Jong-un rational? The nature of the launch is still being determined, but analysts have said the test could suggest a longer range than previously tested devices. The Japanese defence minister said it flew for about 30 minutes before falling in the Sea of Japan and could be a new type of missile. Tomomi Inada said it covered a distance of about 700km (435 miles), reaching an altitude of more than 2,000km (1,245 miles) - higher than that reached by an intermediate-range missile North Korea fired in February.  Intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBMs] can potentially reach altitudes of hundreds of kilometres, taking them well outside the Earth's atmosphere. Experts quoted by Reuters say the altitude meant the missile was launched at a high trajectory, limiting the lateral distance it travelled. They say if it had been fired at a standard trajectory, it would have had a range of at least 4,000km.  The US Pacific Command said in a statement the type was being assessed but that its flight was not consistent with that of an ICBM, which would have the range to reach the US mainland (more than 6,000km). North Korea is believed to be developing two types of ICBM, but neither has so far been flight tested. If the Japanese analysis of the trajectory is right (that the missile reached an altitude of 2,000km), North Korea appears to have advanced its technology markedly.  The previous two tests failed, so reliability is not there yet. But last month some experts reckoned that a seemingly new missile on parade in Pyongyang may have been an ICBM (the type President Trump said ""won't happen"").  Jeffrey Lewis of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California thought at the time that the new missiles on show might be ICBMs. Is this that missile?   One thing is certain: North Korea will certainly trumpet its success if it does now have the capability to strike the US military bases on Guam, 3,400km from Pyongyang in the Western Pacific. Mr Trump would ponder what to do with even greater urgency. Mr Moon hosted an emergency meeting of his security council  in the wake of the launch. ""The president said while South Korea remains open to the possibility of dialogue with North Korea, it is only possible when the North shows a change in attitude,"" his spokesman said. Meanwhile, a member of South Korea's ruling party attending a major summit in China reportedly told the North Korean delegation directly that they ""strongly condemned"" the launch. The White House said President Donald Trump ""cannot imagine Russia is pleased"" because the missile did not land far from Russian territory. A Kremlin spokesperson later said Russian President Vladimir Putin was concerned by the test. China, North Korea's only major ally, called for restraint by ""all relevant parties"" in the wake of the latest test. The North has conducted five nuclear tests despite UN sanctions and is also developing long-range missiles.  It is reported to be continuing efforts to miniaturise nuclear warheads and fit them on missiles capable of reaching the US. Washington has accused other UN Security Council members of not fully enforcing existing sanctions against the North, and has urged China in particular to use its trade links as influence.",Monday 15 May 2017,15-May-17,Missile test due to N Korea 'paranoia',"The US will continue to ""tighten the screws"" on North Korea, the US ambassador to the UN says.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39915299
"Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg in call to help working mothers Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg has made a US Mother's Day call for the government to do more for working women. The social media giant's chief operating officer called for a higher minimum wage, paid family leave and affordable childcare. Some 40% of US households with children rely on a woman as the key breadwinner, she said in a Facebook post. ""It's time for our public policies to catch up with what our families deserve and what our values demand,"" she said. Ms Sandberg, an influential voice in corporate America, is one of the wealthiest American women with a net worth estimated at $1.38bn. She wrote on Sunday that the US government and employers must do more to help parents, especially single mothers, who are struggling to provide for their children while assuring their safety and well-being. The widowed mother of two said: ""We all have a responsibility to help mothers as well as fathers balance their responsibilities at work and home."" One of the most important actions the government could take is to help millions of families living near the poverty line by raising the federal minimum wage, she said.  ""Childcare for two children exceeds the median annual rent in all 50 states. How are parents supposed to work if they don't have a safe and affordable place to leave their kids?"" She continued: ""We need paid leave. The United States is one of the only developed countries in the world that doesn't guarantee paid family leave - and we're the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave.  ""That means many moms are forced to return to work right after giving birth to keep their jobs."" She concluded: ""I hope we can also use this day to commit to do more for all the mothers who have given so much and deserve even more."" Ms Sandberg's message was accompanied by a picture of her with her mother and mother-in-law on the day of her wedding to former SurveyMonkey chief executive Dave Goldberg, who died in 2015. In her book Lean In, she encouraged women to be more ambitious in the workplace. Following Mr Goldberg's death, she co-wrote the book Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy that was published this year.  President Donald Trump's daughter and advisor Ivanka Trump has publicly stated her support for paid maternity leave. However, Republicans have resisted proposals to raise such benefits, including increasing the national minimum wage.

"Eurovision Song Contest: Portugal winner 'didn't understand votes' Portugal has won this year's Eurovision Song contest with a poignant love song, sung in Portuguese. In the early hours of Sunday morning the winner met the world's press - glass microphone trophy still in hand. Salvador Sobral entered the Eurovision Song Contest's press room last night with the same diffident, bemused demeanour he has projected since arriving in Kiev. There was no swagger, no elation - just a quizzical befuddlement at the latest turn his musical journey had taken. Like many watching at home around the world, the Lisbon-born 27-year-old had been baffled by the complex voting system that the contest adopted last year. ""I didn't understand the votes,"" he admitted to reporters. ""I think that you have to be a mathematician or something to know what's going on."" Nor did he expect overnight fame and fortune to come with the honour of becoming Portugal's first Eurovision winner. ""I don't think anything will change,"" he shrugged. ""You win today and tomorrow, no one remembers it. ""Honestly, man, I just want to live a peaceful life,"" he told another journalist.  ""If I thought of myself as a national hero or champion of Europe, it would be a bit weird."" Even in such an eclectic line-up as the one Eurovision served up this year, Sobral stood apart. While some countries offered amusing gimmicks (Romanian yodelling, Italy's dancing gorilla) and others sleek, assembly-line pop, his delicate, heartfelt ballad stood out precisely because it was so unassuming. Written by Sobral's older sister Luisa, Amar Pelos Dois - whose title translates into English as Love for Both of Us - speaks to all genders and orientations with its inclusive, unadorned message. Sobral said he would be delighted if its Eurovision triumph had some impact, however small, on how music is made, produced and marketed. ""People listen to songs because they're thrown at you,"" he said. ""You have to like this because we're going to play it 16 times a day and force you to like it. ""This is music with content, an emotional song with a beautiful lyrical message and harmony - things people are not used to listening these days. ""If I can help to bring some change to music I would be really joyful,"" he said, dressed as ever in a modest dark suit. ""And I hope it will encourage people to bring different things and all sorts of music to future editions of this contest."" Those future editions could learn much from this year, which offered audiences a spectacular, entertaining and endlessly quirky diversion. For a contest whose slogan was ""celebrate diversity"", though, it was surprising more thought was not given to basic areas of presentation. The final and the two semi-finals that preceded it were hosted by a trio of white male TV presenters who are all well-known in host nation Ukraine. Commentator Graham Norton and one of his Australian counterparts were not alone in remarking that the line-up was hardly indicative of the contest's stated aim. For the millions watching at home, however, it was the variety, the colour and the craziness that made it unmissable Saturday night viewing. In keeping with Eurovision tradition, Portugal will host the 2018 iteration of an event that continues to unify Europe in a way politics never can or will.

"Angela Merkel's CDU 'seizes key state from rivals' Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU) have unseated the Social Democrats in a key state election, exit polls say. Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU is projected to win 34.5% of votes in North Rhine-Westphalia, compared with 30.5% for the Social Democrats (SPD). It was seen as a test for Mrs Merkel ahead of September's general election. The SPD has run the state - Germany's most populous - for most of the post-war period. Party leader Martin Schulz said it was a ""hard day"". Voters were choosing candidates for the state legislature, whose leadership may now change from its current SPD-Green coalition. The SPD's vote is said to be down by 8.6 percentage points on the last election there in 2012, while the CDU vote is up by almost the same amount. Mr Schulz had predicted a victory there would make him the next German chancellor - but the victory for Mrs Merkel's party will now give her a boost as she seeks a fourth term. The first exit polls also predict 12% for the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP); 6% for the Greens; 7.5% for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AFD); and 5% for The Left. ""This is a hard day for social democracy,"" said Martin Schulz, visibly shaken. It is also difficult day for him personally. North Rhine-Westphalia is his home state and traditionally an SPD stronghold. So although the concrete issues that shaped this election were primarily regional - such as schools, transport and security - this state also matters nationally. It is seen as a bellwether for national elections.  There was a boost in his poll ratings and a surge of excitement when Mr Schulz announced earlier this year that he would challenge Mrs Merkel - it became known as the ""Schulz effect"".  His plan was to win over voters with a down-to-earth approach. But policy proposals have remained vague, and critics say the folksy charm has started to wear thin. Now that his party has lost three regional elections in a row, the polls are down and the Schulz effect may have vanished as quickly as it came. The result could also mean the worst election result for the SPD since 1947, Die Welt newspaper reports. Polls before the vote had suggested the CDU and SDP were neck-and-neck. But the CDU's campaign - which targeted voters' frustration on issues such as traffic congestion, rising crime and education - appears to have swayed voters. It promised to improve security, with longer prison terms for offenders and more funds for the police.",Monday 15 May 2017,15-May-17,Merkel party seizes key state from rivals,"Chancellor Merkel's CDU beats the SPD in elections in Germany's most populous state, exit polls say.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39914333
"Singapore LGBT rally says 'no choice' but to bar outsiders Singapore's Pink Dot LGBT rights rally will allow only Singaporean citizens and permanent residents to attend this year's event because of legal changes. Organisers announced the restrictions with ""profound regret"", saying they had been reminded of new rules by police in the wealthy city state. Previously only locals were allowed to actively ""demonstrate"" by holding up placards, but foreigners could nonetheless attend, Pink Dot says. Gay sex is illegal in Singapore. The Pink Dot rally has been held annually since 2009 in the country's Speakers' Corner, where demonstrations are allowed without a police permit. About 30% of Singapore's population are neither citizens nor permanent residents. In a statement on Sunday, Pink Dot said that recent changes to Singapore's Public Order Act meant that ""the law no longer distinguishes between participants and observers, and regards anyone who turns up to the Speakers' Corner in support of an event to be part of an assembly"". As a result, the organisers said they would have to check identity cards at this year's event on 1 July. The event says 28,000 people attended in 2015. Is Singapore's stance on homosexuality changing? Groups condemn Singapore gay ruling On Saturday, Singapore police warned that only Singaporean citizens and permanent residents could participate in assemblies at Speakers' Corner that do not have a permit.  In a statement, the LGBT event's organisers said they had ""been honoured by the strong support from friends from around the world who have unfailingly attended our events over the years, observing as their Singaporean friends make a stand for inclusion, diversity and the freedom to love"". They acknowledged the new restrictions could separate couples, friends and families, adding they were ""just as upset by this"".  Pink Dot warned that if non-Singaporeans or non-permanent residents insisted on attending the event, both they and the organisers could be charged and prosecuted.  Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs said it was not trying to proscribe such events. ""This approach is consistent with the government's long-held position that foreigners and foreign entities should not engage in our domestic issues, especially political issues or controversial social issues,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. The spokesperson said that the rules were ""applied equally to all public assemblies and processions"". Human rights group Amnesty International said it was concerned that new powers would be used to ""further curtail freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in a country where government critics and activists are already heavily controlled"". The new rules are the latest setback for Pink Dot, after the government last year barred foreign firms from sponsoring events at Speakers' Corner without a permit.

"Austria could see election 'in autumn' after coalition ends Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern has said he expects an early election ""in the autumn"" after his coalition partners abruptly ended their alliance. It comes after months of disagreements between Mr Kern's Social Democrats and the People's Party on policy reform. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, of the People's Party, said he would suggest a snap poll to the chancellor on Monday. An early election will give Austria's far-right Freedom Party another chance of entering national government. ""In my view, the first step is a joint proposal [from the former coalition partners] for early elections,"" Mr Kurz said, after being voted head of the centre-right People's Party. The coalition was thrown into doubt when the People's Party's then leader, Reinhold Mitterlehner, quit last week. ""It has to be accepted that the [People's Party] put an end to this coalition on Friday live on television.

"Toyota 'backs flying car project' in Japan Japanese carmaker Toyota has announced its backing for a group of engineers who are developing a flying car. It will give 40 million yen (£274, 000) to the Cartivator group that operates outside Toyota city in central Japan.  The Nikkei Asian Review reports Toyota and its group companies have agreed in principle to support the project.

"Moscow protests over demolition of Soviet-era homes Thousands of people took to Moscow's streets to protest against plans to demolish their Soviet-era homes. The three- to five-storey Soviet apartments are nicknamed ""khrushchovki"" after the former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Moscow's plan to demolish the blocks and resettle nearly a million people has met stiff opposition. Opponents claim their rights are being ignored and many fear they will not be compensated fairly by the state. Some protesters believe the project is simply a way to divert funds to construction companies. ""Let us keep our houses!"" a 59-year-old engineer shouted, laying the blame directly at the feet of mayor Sergei Sobyanin. ""It's Sobyanin who should be demolished. This is in the interest of developers and the authorities,"" she told the AFP news agency. But the project also has the backing of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The BBC's Chloe Arnold, attending the protest, said signs called for the resignation of mayor Sobyanin, and the crowd chanted: ""Hands off our property!"" Many of the attendees had never protested before, she said, but came demanding to know where they would live when their homes are torn down next year.  There was also a marked difference in crowd estimates, according to the AFP news agency - police said about 5,000 people attended, while organisers claimed 30,000 protesters turned up. Opposition politicians also attended the protest, amid a heavy police presence. The khrushchovki were built by the thousands in the 1950s and 60s, during a housing crisis. They were often built with haste out of prefabricated concrete, and were only intended as a temporary solution. Many are now in poor repair and require replacement. Moscow's $61bn (£47.5bn) renovation project is, supporters say, designed to replace the old five-storey buildings with modern high-rise apartment blocks. However, the bill currently making its way through parliament does not guarantee that residents will be compensated with a new home of the same value in the same area. Instead, it simply promises a new apartment of the same size. In light of the controversy, both mayor Sobyanin and President Putin have hinted at amendments to the plan to address residents' concerns.",Monday 15 May 2017,15-May-17,Protest over Moscow home demolitions,"Residents fear the plan, backed by the Russian president, will forcibly move them to other areas.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39915830

Joanna Lumley takes to the stage to accept the Academy's highest honour: We as actors, we're dragged about in golden carriages... we are furnished with words, costumed, made up, we have stunt performers to make us look better. We have people who drive us, who dress us. We have all this. For me this is paradise because I'm here where I wanted to be - I'm in the company that I wish to keep ever since I was young. I wanted to be with people who left race and religion and age and gender and shoe size and things outside the door when they came. People who are in our profession don't have those discriminations. Joanna Lumley: Six times she was absolutely fabulous Host Sue Perkins introduced the leading actress category by saying the
requirement was ""being paid just under the same amount as the leading actor"". The award was presented to Sarah Lancashire by James Nesbitt, who said he was wearing a
badge supporting a campaign called Equal Representation for Actresses.
 He said: For one female role there are three male roles. As the father of two girls, that should change. That's it for the competitive awards - so we now know that Happy Valley and Damilola, Our Loved Boy, are the biggest winners with two prizes each in the main categories. Catch up on the full list of winners and nominees here. We also know that, surprisingly, there's been nothing for The Crown - despite the fact it led the nominations with five. In chronological order: ""We love you!"" shouts an audience member as Lancashire takes to the stage. She thanks her co-stars and Happy Valley writer Sally Wainwright, who she describes as ""extraordinary"" Paying tribute to one of her fellow nominees, Lancashire adds: ""Claire Foy, you have given me the best 10 hours under a duvet I've ever had."" Benedict Cumberbatch has lost out - with Akhtar picking up the best actor award instead for the one-off drama telling the story of a honour killing.  The other nominees were Babou Ceesay and Robbie Coltrane. ""We've already started on next year's series,"" says Dec. ""What a huge lovely cherry on top of the cake."" Mosaku won for playing Gloria Taylor, the mother of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor, who was killed in 2000. His family's story was turned into a 90-minute BBC One drama, which has already been named best single drama tonight. I want to thank the Taylors for your courage and honesty.  I'd like to dedicate this to the memory of Damilola and his mother Gloria. As in golf. This award goes to Sky Sports/European Tour Productions/Sky Sports 1. Hollander, who played Hugh Laurie's menacing henchman Corky, was The Night Manager's only nominee. In his speech, he said filming the programme was ""a very happy time"". Thank you very much, this was a really fun job and a great part and it was a lovely team of people. To be given this at the end of it is a very, very lovely feeling so thanks all the people who voted for me. Many fans of the show were up in arms that Tom Hiddleston, Olivia Colman and/or Hugh Laurie weren't nominated too - but at least the show's got one award. The ceremony pauses to pay tribute to some of those we've lost in the past year, including Andrew Sachs, Jean Alexander, Gorden Kaye, Robert Vaughan, Jimmy Perry, Tim Piggott-Smith, Colin Dexter, Liz Smith and Caroline Aherne. One of the contributors to the programme, Mehreen says: ""There are 1.6 billion Muslims around the world and we knew it was impossible for the 10 of us to represent every single one of them. But the message behind [this programme] is not confined to one community. Regardless of your race or religion, we need to write our own narrative and stand up for what we believe in.  ""So thank you BBC and Love [Productions] for being brave enough in the current climate to provide us with that platform, Bafta for supporting our show, and my wonderful family who despite the stereotypes have always encouraged me to be a strong woman who has a voice and uses it to make a change.""

"Syria's Saydnaya prison crematorium hid killings, says US The Syrian government has constructed a crematorium at a military prison to dispose of the remains of thousands of murdered prisoners, the US has alleged.  The state department has released satellite images of the facility which it said was used to hide evidence. Rights groups say thousands of inmates have been tortured and hanged at the military prison outside Damascus. Syria has not responded to the latest claims but it has in the past strongly denied any abuse at the jail. In February, Amnesty International said that mass hangings had taken place every week at the jail between 2011 and 2015. The government at that time dismissed Amnesty's claims as ""baseless"" and ""devoid of truth"", insisting that all executions in Syria followed due process. More allegations of abuse at Saydnaya resurfaced on Monday. ""Credible sources have believed that many of the bodies have been disposed in mass graves,"" Acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones told reporters. Thousands hanged at Saydnaya prison, Amnesty says 'How I was tortured in a Syrian jail' ""We now believe that the Syrian regime has installed a crematorium in the Saydnaya prison complex which could dispose of detainees' remains with little evidence,"" he said. Evidence of the crematorium hiding or disguising mass murders at the prison will be presented to the international community, Mr Jones said. He said that newly de-classified documentation ""underscore the depths to which the Syrian regime has gone, with the continuing support of its allies, Russia and Iran"". ""The facts we're presenting today are based on reporting from international and local non-governmental organisations, press reporting and also intelligence community assessments."" Mr Jones said the Syrian government had modified a building within the Saydnaya complex ""to support"" the suspected crematorium. ""Although the regime's many atrocities are well documented, we believe that the building of a crematorium is an effort to cover up the extent of mass murders taking place in Saydnaya prison,"" he said. According to Amnesty's report in February, which was based on the testimony of witnesses, it was estimated that between 5,000 and 13,000 people were executed at Saydnaya over five years. Scores more suffered systematic torture, it said.  Every week and often twice a week, groups of between 20 and 50 people, mostly opposition supporters, were executed in total secrecy at the Saydnaya facility near Damascus, the rights organisation said. The report said that executions had been authorised at the highest levels of government and that tens of thousands of people have been imprisoned during Syria's six-year-old civil war. Amnesty said such practices amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity.",Tuesday 16 May 2017,16-May-17,Syria jail crematorium hid killings - US,The US says the prison was modified in 2013 in an effort to cover up the mass killings of inmates.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39926914
"Barron Trump to attend Maryland school after White House move Barron Trump, US President Donald Trump's 11-year-old son, will attend a school outside Washington when he moves into the White House this summer. Barron and his mother Melania, Mr Trump's third wife, are expected to leave Trump Tower in New York after the end of the current school year. He will go to St Andrew's Episcopal School in Maryland, where tuition costs almost $40,000 (£31,000) per year. There had been questions about when the First Family would move to Washington. Mrs Trump said in a statement that St Andrew's was ""known for its diverse community and commitment to academic excellence"", adding: ""We look forward to the coming school years.""  Barron will be the first child of a president to attend the school, which is a 30-minute drive from the White House. St Andrew's has refused to comment on their newest student, citing reasons of privacy. Recent First Daughters such as Sasha and Malia Obama have attended Sidwell Friends, a Quaker school with campuses in Washington and Maryland. The White House announcement comes after St Andrew's sent a letter to parents on Friday, informing them of the First Family's decision. St Andrew's had intended to wait until the summer to make the announcement in order to stave off possible protests while school was in session, the Washington Post reports.

"Miss USA Kara McCullough criticised for saying healthcare a 'privilege' The new Miss USA beauty pageant winner has sparked controversy by declaring that healthcare was a ""privilege"", not a right. Kara McCullough, a scientist at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, appeared to link healthcare to employment. But the beauty queen, 25, faced a backlash on social media. It comes as the Trump administration battles to overturn Obamacare, which aimed to extend insurance coverage to the 15% of Americans who lack it.  Earlier this month the lower chamber of the US Congress passed a new healthcare act that Democrats say will leave millions uninsured. However, Republicans in the Senate have indicated they will cast it aside and write a new law. Asked during Sunday's pageant in Las Vegas whether healthcare was a privilege or a right, Miss McCullough said: ""I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege."" She added: ""As a government employee, I'm granted healthcare and I see first hand that for one to have healthcare, you need to have jobs. ""We need to continue to cultivate this environment that we're given the opportunity to have healthcare as well as jobs to all American citizens worldwide."" Her remarks divided liberal-minded and conservative-minded viewers. Some were quick to criticise her stance. Miss McCullough - who was born in Italy and was representing Washington DC - was also asked if she considered herself to be a feminist but said she preferred the term ""equalism"" and said men and women had equal opportunity in US workplaces. ""I don't really want to consider myself - try not to consider myself like this die-hard, you know, like, 'Oh, I don't really care about men',"" said the contestant, who says she wants to see more women employed in government science roles. Some people on social media supported her views. Obamacare has been opposed by Republicans since it was first proposed in 2009. Republicans say the law imposes too many costs on business and describe it as a ""job killer"", although the number of jobs in the healthcare sector has risen since it was introduced. Opponents have also decried it as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.",Tuesday 16 May 2017,16-May-17,Miss USA in healthcare 'privilege' row,"Kara McCullough, a nuclear scientist, appeared to link healthcare to employment.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39922784
"'White Lady' wolf shot dead prompts Yellowstone reward A $5,000 (£3,900) reward has been put up for information on how a rare white wolf at Yellowstone National Park was shot dead. The female was one of three white wolves in the park and had 14 living pups, wildlife officials say. The reward comes after initial results of a necropsy show the so-called White Lady was shot around 10 April. ""She was one of the most recognisable wolves and sought after by visitors to view and photograph,"" the park said. ""Due to the serious nature of this incident, a reward of up to $5,000 is offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individual(s) responsible for this criminal act,"" said Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk. At 12 years old, she had lived for more than twice the average lifespan of a wolf in Yellowstone, officials say. The Canyon Pack Alpha, as she was known to wildlife researchers (and as The White Lady to tourists), was found by hikers on 11 April.  Wildlife officials  were not able to save its life, and the wolf was put down. Her remains were brought to a US Fish & Wildlife Service Forensics Laboratory in Oregon for a necropsy, where officials determined that it had been mortally wounded by a hunter's rifle. As of 2014, researchers had documented at least 104 wolves in 11 packs located within the park. The wolves were reintroduced in Yellowstone in 1995, having been eradicated by hunters. Advocates of wolves say the presence of predators helps balance the ecosystem, and leads to healthier populations of other wild animals. Opponents say they are a threat to humans, pets and livestock.

"Dinosaur asteroid hit 'worst possible place' Scientists who drilled into the impact crater associated with the demise of the dinosaurs summarise their findings so far in a BBC Two documentary on Monday.  The researchers recovered rocks from under the Gulf of Mexico that were hit by an asteroid 66 million years ago.  The nature of this material records the details of the event.  It is becoming clear that the 15km-wide asteroid could not have hit a worse place on Earth.  The shallow sea covering the target site meant colossal volumes of sulphur (from the mineral gypsum) were injected into the atmosphere, extending the ""global winter"" period that followed the immediate firestorm.  Had the asteroid struck a different location, the outcome might have been very different.  ""This is where we get to the great irony of the story – because in the end it wasn’t the size of the asteroid, the scale of blast, or even its global reach that made dinosaurs extinct – it was where the impact happened,"" said Ben Garrod, who presents The Day The Dinosaurs Died with Alice Roberts.  ""Had the asteroid struck a few moments earlier or later, rather than hitting shallow coastal waters it might have hit deep ocean.  ""An impact in the nearby Atlantic or Pacific oceans would have meant much less vaporised rock – including the deadly gypsum. The cloud would have been less dense and sunlight could still have reached the planet’s surface, meaning what happened next might have been avoided.  ""In this cold, dark world food ran out of the oceans within a week and shortly after on land. With nothing to eat anywhere on the planet, the mighty dinosaurs stood little chance of survival.""  Ben Garrod spent time on the drill rig that was stationed 30km off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula in April/May last year, to better understand the aims of the project; Alice Roberts visited widely separated fossil beds in the Americas, to get a sense of how life was upended by the impact.  Rock cores from up to 1,300m beneath the Gulf were recovered.  The lowest sections of this material come from a feature within the crater called the peak ring.  This is made from rock that has been heavily fractured and altered by immense pressures.  By analysing its properties, the drill project team - led by Profs Jo Morgan and Sean Gulick - hope to reconstruct how the impact proceeded and the environmental changes it brought about.  Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth They know now the energy that went into making the crater when the asteroid struck - equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima A-bombs. And they also understand how the depression assumed the structure we observe today.  The team is also gaining insights into the return of life to the impact site in the years after the event.  One of the many fascinating sequences in the BBC Two programme sees Alice Roberts visit a quarry in New Jersey, US, where 25,000 fossil fragments have been recovered - evidence of a mass die-off of creatures that may have been among the casualties on the day of the impact itself.  ""All these fossils occur in a layer no more than 10cm thick,"" palaeontologist Ken Lacovara tells Alice. ""They died suddenly and were buried quickly. It tells us this is a moment in geological time. That's days, weeks, maybe months. But this is not thousands of years; it's not hundreds of thousands of years. This is essentially an instantaneous event.""

"WannaCry ransomware cyber-attacks slow but fears remain A computer malware that has spread across 150 countries appears to be slowing down, with few reports of fresh attacks globally on Monday. A spokesperson for police agency Europol said the situation in Europe ""seems stable"". In Asia, where many offices closed before the WannaCry ransomware struck on Friday, the attack has been less severe than expected. The ransomware takes over users' files, demanding $300 (£230) to restore them. The White House said on Monday that under $70,000 (£54,000) had been paid in total in a bid to get any locked data released. Payments could go up as the ransomware warned the cost would double after three days, and threatened to delete files within seven days if no payment was made. Computer giant Microsoft said the attack, which has affected hundreds of thousands of computers, should serve as a wake-up call. Among the organisations targeted worldwide have been Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry. Many firms employed experts over the weekend to try to prevent new infections. Senior spokesman for Europol, Jan Op Gen Oorth, told the AFP news agency: ""The number of victims appears not to have gone up and so far the situation seems stable in Europe, which is a success. ""It seems that a lot of internet security guys over the weekend did their homework and ran the security software updates."" UK Health Minister Jeremy Hunt confirmed to the BBC that UK intelligence services had found no evidence of a second wave of attacks on Monday. The badly affected National Health Service said seven out of 47 trusts that were hit were still facing serious issues. French carmaker Renault said its plant in the northern town of Douai would not reopen on Monday as it dealt with the cyber-attack.  In Asia, the spread was reportedly slowing, with banking systems largely unaffected: US President Donald Trump's Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert has also confirmed that no US federal government systems were affected. This won't take long. Nobody knows. Europol's Jan Op Gen Oorth said: ""A bit early to say... but we are working on a decrypting tool"". Associated Press quoted Tim Wellsmore, of US security firm FireEye, as saying: ""We expect this is a small operation... They just happened to hit the mother lode."" Russian President Vladimir Putin said: ""Russia has absolutely nothing to do with it."" EU Commissioner for Security Julian King told the BBC on Monday that the EU was proposing legislation to reinforce cyber security in the wake of the attack. Some private sector security researchers say they have seen some similarities between some of the code in the recent attack and some linked to North Korea in the past.  Security officials in the UK, however, say they have not seen anything they would regard as hard evidence, Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, reports. Companies in Asia and Europe have been warning employees to be careful when clicking on attachments and links in their emails. The message from the UK's National Crime Agency was ""do not pay!"" - there is no guarantee that systems will be restored. Michael Gazeley, of Network Box, a Hong Kong-based cyber-security firm, told Reuters there were still ""many 'landmines' waiting in people's inboxes"", adding that his firm had detected a new version that infected users directly via a malicious link on hacked websites. Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, also said it would be easy for the initial attackers or ""copy-cat authors"" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against. A UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, had predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"". MalwareTech, whose name was revealed in UK media to be 22-year-old Marcus Hutchins, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it. The computing giant says the tool used in this current attack had been developed by the US National Security Agency and was stolen by hackers. It is highly critical of the way governments store data on software vulnerabilities. Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said on Sunday: ""We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on Wikileaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world. ""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen."" The organisation also said that many organisations had failed to keep their systems up to date, allowing the virus to spread. Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it.

"Moors Murderer Ian Brady 'gravely ill' Moors Murderer Ian Brady is gravely ill and receiving palliative care, the BBC understands. Brady, who is 79, is being held at Ashworth Hospital, a secure psychiatric unit on Merseyside. The serial killer has been ill for some time and is being looked after by specially-trained nurses. Brady, who now uses the name Ian Stewart-Brady, was jailed for three murders in 1966 and has been at Ashworth since 1985. He has campaigned for several years to be moved from the secure unit to a Scottish prison, where he would not be force-fed and be allowed to die if he wishes. The 79-year-old has been on successive hunger strikes since 1999 and has previously argued that he should be allowed to die, but has been force-fed because he is considered to be mentally ill. His request was turned down in 2013 on the grounds of his chronic mental illness and he refused to take part in a further review of his case in 2016, after it was ruled his solicitor Robin Makin could not be involved. His legal challenge to that ban was rejected in February. At that point, his legal team said he was ""terminally ill"" and had been bedridden for the last few years with emphysema. Brady and Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, tortured and murdered five children in the 1960s. Four of the victims were buried on Saddleworth Moor, near Oldham. The pair were jailed over the killings of John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans in 1966, before later admitting the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett.

"Innisfil partners with Uber to provide public transport A small Canadian town has launched a first-of-its-kind ride sharing-transit partnership with Uber.  Innisfil will subsidise a portion of the fare for all trips with the taxi firm taken by residents within the town's boundaries.  Officials say the deal offers more flexibility for residents and is cheaper than adding a town bus service.  Uber Canada public policy manager Chris Schafer says the project has sparked global interest.  The cost of a ride to any four of the community's transport or recreation hubs will cost residents between C$3 (US$2.20/£1.70) and C$5 (US$3.60/£2.80).  They will also get a C$5 discount on any custom trip within Innisfil, a lake-side Ontario town of about 36,000 people 100 km (62 miles) north of Toronto.  Tim Cane, the town's land use planning manager, said Innisfil had been struggling to figure out an affordable transport model that would serve an area over 290 square km (110 square miles).  A bus would have cost the town $270,000 annually for one route and $610,000 for two, which they thought would be too expensive, Mr Cane added. Mr Cane said the town council wrestled for years with the question: ""How do we afford a transit model that on a good day would serve maybe 20% of the population?"" Senior Innisfil official Jason Reynar issued his staff the challenge, and the idea for a ""demand-responsive transit service"" was born. But one cab company owner has expressed frustration. Global Taxi owner Manjot Saini told the CP24 news station that Uber puts local taxis at a disadvantage. He worries he might lose drivers to the competition.  ""Uber is destroying the industry,"" he said.  Mr Cane said the town consulted with the three local companies early in the process and the programme was ""never about Uber versus taxis"" but about providing a service to residents.  ""Let's just try this on,"" said Mr Cane. ""Whatever service we provide is better than a service we don't have.""  The community has set aside $100,000 for the programme's initial 6-9 month phase and another $125,000 for the indeterminate second phase.

"Confederate monuments: Virginia mayor condemns 'KKK-style' rally A mayor in the US state of Virginia has condemned a torch-lit rally on Saturday night, saying protesters borrowed racist tactics from American history. Mayor Mike Signer said the rally against the removal of Confederate monuments ""harkens back to the days of the KKK"" - the white supremacist group. Protesters are upset over the city's decision to remove statues honouring the losing side of the US Civil War. More than 100 people attended a counter-protest the following night. Several dozen protesters had held the torch-lit rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, at about 21:00 local time on Saturday night (01:00 GMT Sunday) to protest against the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee. The protesters were heard chanting, ""You will not replace us"", ""Russia is our friend"" and the far-right nationalist slogan ""blood and soil"". Mayor Signer said in a statement: ""This event involving torches at night in Lee Park was either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instil fear in our minority populations in a way that harkens back to the days of the KKK."" The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a terror group that arose after the Confederacy was defeated by the Union in the Civil War. Its tactics included random acts of violence against black people, as well as vandalism, cross-burning, and other forms of intimidation. Mr Signer said that, as a community, ""we reject this intimidation"" adding ""intolerance is not welcome here"". Protesters on Saturday held lit torches for about 10 minutes, local media reported, before a fight broke out and police dispersed the crowd. The rally was led by Richard Spencer, a fixture of the so-called ""alt-right"" movement, who was filmed shortly after the election of Donald Trump leading supporters in Nazi salutes as they shouted ""Heil Trump"". ""We will not be replaced from this park,"" Mr Spencer told the crowd at a different rally held hours earlier. ""We will not be replaced from this world. Whites have a future. We have a future of power, of beauty, of expression,"" he said. Cities across the southern US have been debating the removal of Confederate symbols since a 2015 massacre at a black church in South Carolina by a self-avowed white supremacist gunman. The issue has entered into the Virginia governor's election, with Republican candidate Corey Stewart vowing not to remove any Confederate memorials if he is elected.

"France's Macron calls for 'historic reconstruction' of Europe France's new president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for a ""historic reconstruction"" of Europe, saying it is ""the only reaction"" to fight populism. Speaking in Berlin on the first full day of his presidency, he was joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said the pair had a ""joint conviction"" that they needed to ""deepen the European Union"". Both said they would work together more closely on defence, eurozone reform and reducing bureaucracy. Mrs Merkel said the EU depended on France being strong, and that she and Mr Macron had a ""joint conviction that we are not only going to deal with the British exit from the European Union, but we also need to deepen the EU"". She also made her most positive comments yet about eurozone reforms mooted by Mr Macron, saying it may be possible to change EU treaties as would be required to enact them.  ""From the German point of view, it's possible to change the treaty if it makes sense,"" she said. ""I would be ready to do this, but first we will work on what we want to reform."" There was a warm welcome for the new French president both from Angela Merkel and - unusually - a crowd singing and dancing outside the chancellory.  In part that's because Berlin is overwhelmingly relieved that it's not Marine Le Pen walking up the red carpet. But it's also because, in Mr Macron, Angela Merkel has a counterpart with whom she shares a desire to reshape the European Union following Britain's departure. There is a genuine hope here that the French-German relationship, once so fundamental to the European Project, can be rekindled.  But some of Mr Macron's ideas about economic reform have raised eyebrows in Berlin - in an election year Angela Merkel won't risk anything which voters might perceive as a German bailout of struggling member states. And, despite the smiles on Monday, Mr Macron has yet to prove himself. Berlin expects him to succeed where others have failed; deliver his election promise and kick start the French economy. Mr Macron wants to create a common eurozone budget, parliament and finance minister. He denied being in favour of making all countries that use the euro liable for other individual countries' existing debt.

Its tactics included random acts of violence against black people, as well as vandalism, cross-burning, and other forms of intimidation. Mr Signer said that, as a community, ""we reject this intimidation"" adding ""intolerance is not welcome here"". Protesters on Saturday held lit torches for about 10 minutes, local media reported, before a fight broke out and police dispersed the crowd. The rally was led by Richard Spencer, a fixture of the so-called ""alt-right"" movement, who was filmed shortly after the election of Donald Trump leading supporters in Nazi salutes as they shouted ""Heil Trump"". ""We will not be replaced from this park,"" Mr Spencer told the crowd at a different rally held hours earlier. ""We will not be replaced from this world. Whites have a future. We have a future of power, of beauty, of expression,"" he said. Cities across the southern US have been debating the removal of Confederate symbols since a 2015 massacre at a black church in South Carolina by a self-avowed white supremacist gunman. The issue has entered into the Virginia governor's election, with Republican candidate Corey Stewart vowing not to remove any Confederate memorials if he is elected.

"France's Macron calls for 'historic reconstruction' of Europe France's new president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for a ""historic reconstruction"" of Europe, saying it is ""the only reaction"" to fight populism. Speaking in Berlin on the first full day of his presidency, he was joined by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said the pair had a ""joint conviction"" that they needed to ""deepen the European Union"". Both said they would work together more closely on defence, eurozone reform and reducing bureaucracy. Mrs Merkel said the EU depended on France being strong, and that she and Mr Macron had a ""joint conviction that we are not only going to deal with the British exit from the European Union, but we also need to deepen the EU"". She also made her most positive comments yet about eurozone reforms mooted by Mr Macron, saying it may be possible to change EU treaties as would be required to enact them.  ""From the German point of view, it's possible to change the treaty if it makes sense,"" she said. ""I would be ready to do this, but first we will work on what we want to reform."" There was a warm welcome for the new French president both from Angela Merkel and - unusually - a crowd singing and dancing outside the chancellory.  In part that's because Berlin is overwhelmingly relieved that it's not Marine Le Pen walking up the red carpet. But it's also because, in Mr Macron, Angela Merkel has a counterpart with whom she shares a desire to reshape the European Union following Britain's departure. There is a genuine hope here that the French-German relationship, once so fundamental to the European Project, can be rekindled.  But some of Mr Macron's ideas about economic reform have raised eyebrows in Berlin - in an election year Angela Merkel won't risk anything which voters might perceive as a German bailout of struggling member states. And, despite the smiles on Monday, Mr Macron has yet to prove himself. Berlin expects him to succeed where others have failed; deliver his election promise and kick start the French economy. Mr Macron wants to create a common eurozone budget, parliament and finance minister. He denied being in favour of making all countries that use the euro liable for other individual countries' existing debt.

"McDonald's apologises for 'offensive' television advert McDonald's has apologised for ""upset"" caused by a TV advert that charity campaigners have said ""exploits childhood bereavement"". The fast food giant's latest British advert features a boy who struggles to find something in common with his dead father, until it is revealed they shared the same favourite menu item.  The campaign has attracted criticism from widows who called it ""offensive"". A McDonald's spokesperson said: ""This was by no means an intention of ours."" ""We wanted to highlight the role McDonald's has played in our customers' everyday lives - both in good and difficult times,"" the spokesperson added. The campaign, from London-based advertising agency Leo Burnett, first aired on 12 May and is scheduled to run for seven weeks. In the advert, the boy asks his mum about his absent dad, sparking some reminiscence. The boy is left to wonder whether he and his father had anything in common, until he arrives at a McDonald's restaurant and orders a Filet-o-Fish and the mother says: ""That was your dad's favourite too."" Bereavement charity, Grief Encounter said it had received ""countless calls"" from parents saying their bereaved children had been upset by the advert. Sarah Fox's husband died two years ago. The 37-year-old from London said her seven-year-old son, who saw the advert, had only just started to understand the implications of his loss. She said: ""The advert was confusing for him and really upset him. He asked me why the boy on TV wasn't 'sad' and how he could feel happy again? ""It's an unnecessary subject to exploit for the gain of a brand."" Tania Richman, 44 from Brighton, East Sussex, said her teenage children, whose father died last year, were also ""upset and offended"" by the advert. She said: ""I didn't know how to handle them afterwards."" Leah Miller, 42 from London raised concerns about the lack of support advice offered after the advert.  ""What are children supposed to think after watching it? That a simple meal can solve their emotional pain?  ""It's irresponsible not to include any support advice or information for families affected by this issue."" The Advertising Standards Authority said it had received complaints regarding the advert, and would ""carefully assess them to see whether there are grounds to investigate"". One in 29 children in the UK are bereaved of a parent or sibling by the time they are 16, according to Grief Encounter, which offers support to bereaved children and their families. Dr Shelley Gilbert, founder and president of the charity, said: ""McDonald's have attempted to speak to their audience via an emotionally driven TV campaign. ""However, what they have done is exploit childhood bereavement as a way to connect with young people and surviving parents alike - unsuccessfully. ""We fully support children and surviving parents remembering loved ones with memory boxes, family experiences which remind them of happier times and openly talking about the member of the family that has died.

"Mafia controlled Italy migrant centre, say police One of Italy's largest migrant centres has been in the hands of the mafia for more than a decade, police have said. Police say the Arena clan made money by providing services at Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Italy's far south and siphoning off state funds. The clan is alleged to have hidden behind a local Catholic charity which officially runs the centre. The claims came to light on Monday, when officers arrested 68 people, including a local priest. Another of those arrested was Leonardo Sacco, head of the Catholic Misericordia association that is supposed to control the Sant'Anna Cara immigrant centre. The centre holds 1,500 people at a time. It is alleged the Arena clan, part of the powerful 'Ndrangheta crime syndicate, may have taken more than a third of the €100m ($109m/£85m) destined for the centre in the past 10 years. The priest, named as Edoardo Scordio, had received €132,000 already this year for ""spiritual services"", an assistant prosecutor alleged. Police in Catanzaro, a city in the southern Calabria region, said more than 500 agents were involved in the arrests of suspects ""accused of mafia association, extortion, carrying illegal weapons, fraud, embezzlement to the detriment of the state, (and) theft"". The arrests come two years after L'Espresso magazine published an investigation, alleging funds were being stolen and managers were making money by starving the migrants who lived there. A year earlier, it was alleged the number of migrants said to be living at the centre had been greatly over exaggerated, while in 2013 a health inspection found asylum seekers were being fed small portions of out-of-date food. Police believe the clan, through Mr Sacco, was awarding contracts, including for food supplies, to other members of the 'Ndrangheta syndicate, as well as setting up its own associations. According to Rosy Bindi, the head of parliament's anti-mafia commission, the centre had effectively been transformed into ""a money printing operation for organised crime"".

"US Marines defend woman-led recruitment advert The US Marine Corps has defended its latest recruitment advert - the first led by a woman - after critics said it panders to political correctness.  The commercial, titled ""Battle Up"" follows the evolution of a female Marine. She is seen as a schoolgirl standing up to bullies, on a rugby pitch, under fire in combat, and as a veteran helping the homeless. The service said it celebrates the Marines' ""fighting spirit"". In the advert, the protagonist tackles an obstacle course through icy water as the narrator intones: ""No one knows where it comes from. Why some have it, and some don't. It's the fighting spirit, and it needs to be fed. ""It consumes fear, self-doubt and weakness. It stands ready to protect those in danger and to fight - whatever shape the battle takes.""  The Corps hopes the advert will attract women, especially athletes, and send the message that the Marines isn't only open to ""a few good men"". Capt. Erin Demchko, who plays the logistics officer in the ad, served in Afghanistan. She is currently a deputy commander at Camp Courtney in Okinawa, Japan. The advert has been viewed almost 690,000 times on Facebook since it was posted by the official US Marine Corps account on 12 May. But while some praised its unifying message and thanked Capt. Demchko for her service, others sneered. Facebook commenter Chris Clark remarked: ""Had to be a chick...tired of all this political correct bull****... now let all the man haters come out of the woodwork..."" The Marine Corps account replied directly to his comment, writing: ""That's not a ""chick"", Chris. You're watching a Marine."" The force also went into battle on its YouTube account, telling the advert's critics: ""Fans, this is not 'Social Justice Warrior' stuff - just warrior stuff.  ""The Marine Captain protagonist of the film is not being portrayed as an infantry officer - she's being portrayed as a logistics officer, which she is. She's portrayed reacting under fire like all Marines are trained to do, which she's done in real life, in a real firefight.  ""Her story, service and dedication to our country is no less than any of yours because she happens to be a woman.  ""We are recruiting those who share our fighting spirit, and who also meet our higher-than-ever standards and requirements. If that doesn't describe you, then you can probably find better ways to spend your time instead of posting comments on a recruiting-specific social media page."" The Marine Corp is pushing harder than ever to appeal to female recruits, after a nude photo scandal in which a number of Marines shared naked photographs of female colleagues on Facebook. The pictures were posted within a members-only group, and accompanied by highly aggressive threats.  The photo sharing began in the same month that the first US Marine infantry unit began receiving women. Overall, women make up around 8.3% of the 183,000-strong Marine Corps.

"Trump defends 'absolute right' to share 'facts' with Russia US President Donald Trump has defended his ""absolute right"" to discuss sensitive material on terrorism and airline safety at a meeting with Russia's foreign minister. US media reports said he had shared material that was passed on by a partner that had not given permission. The White House refused to comment on reports that Israel was the source. Though not illegal, Mr Trump's alleged gaffe is seen as a breach of trust by many in the intelligence community. Mr Trump met Sergei Lavrov last week in the Oval Office, out of view of the US media. Leading Republicans and Democrats have voiced concerns over what was said, with top Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer calling for the transcripts to be released by the White House. The US Senate Intelligence Committee has also asked for copies of any notes taken in the meeting. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is due to brief the committee later. Mr Trump's alleged disclosures are not illegal, as the US president has the authority to declassify information. Mr Trump tweeted: ""As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety. ""Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against [IS] & terrorism."" It is not clear if Mr Trump was acknowledging having shared intelligence secrets with the Russian officials, thus contradicting White House statements, or whether he was simply trying to explain what had been discussed. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington says this was a carefully constructed defence of the meeting, in which President Trump frames any revelation of intelligence information as a calculated move to advance US national security priorities. After all, the controversy that swirled around the White House on Monday night was never legal, it was political, and this defence may be enough for Republicans to rally around, he adds.  A report in the Washington Post on Monday said Mr Trump had confided top secret information relating to an IS plot thought to centre on the use of laptop computers on aircraft. In a conversation with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in the Oval Office on 10 May, the president revealed details that could lead to the exposure of a source of information, officials told the paper. The intelligence disclosed came from a US ally and was considered too sensitive to share with other US allies, it added. Others at the meeting realised the mistake and scrambled to ""contain the damage"" by informing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA), says the Post. The meeting came a day after Mr Trump fired his FBI chief, James Comey, sparking criticism that he had done so because the FBI was investigating his election campaign's alleged Russian ties. On Tuesday, US media reported the divulged material had been provided to the US by Israel, where Mr Trump is due to visit next week. Pressed by reporters on Tuesday, National Security Adviser HR McMaster declined to say whether or not Mr Trump had shared classified information with the Russians.  He denied the US president had caused a ""lapse in national security"". ""What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged."" He also said President Trump had not been aware of the source of information that was discussed with the Russian officials. Despite the denials issued by the White House that any actual intelligence sources were revealed to the Russians, whatever was said in that Oval Office meeting was enough to alarm certain officials and, reportedly, to alert the CIA and NSA. They in turn will have needed to warn the country that supplied the intelligence. There is a golden rule in the world of espionage that when one government supplies intelligence to another it must not be passed on to a third party without permission of the original supplier. The reason is simple: it could put the lives of their human informants at risk. In this case it appears to relate to the discovery of plans by jihadists in Syria to devise a way of smuggling viable explosive devices on board a plane inside a laptop computer. Given the well-publicised ban on laptops in cabins on certain Middle Eastern routes, whoever revealed that information is unlikely to be still in place.",Wednesday 17 May 2017,17-May-17,Trump defends sharing 'facts' with Russia,The White House won't comment on reports Israel provided the information divulged by Mr Trump.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39937258
"How damaging is 'Comey memo' for Trump? The White House has denied a report that President Donald Trump tried to persuade the FBI to end its investigation into former aide Michael Flynn.  It's not the only Trump crisis of the last 24 hours, coming hard on the heels of the news that the president shared sensitive material with Russian diplomats. Donald Trump is discovering just how dangerous an adversary James Comey can be.  A person doesn't rise as high as Mr Comey did in the federal government without learning how to cover his, er, posterior. With this latest bombshell from the New York Times it's clear that the former FBI director, who was unceremoniously sacked by the president, is poised to enjoy the last laugh. Thanks to his propensity for memo-writing, he may have constructed an arsenal capable of mortally wounding the Trump presidency. At the moment the White House is denying Mr Comey's reported characterisation of the conversation the two men had shortly after the president fired Michael Flynn. In a ""he-said, he-said"" situation, however, the man who wrote contemporaneous documents - memos plural - will have the upper hand. Add that Mr Comey has a reputation for independence, and the face-off looks even more ominous for the president. As deputy attorney general, Mr Comey stood up to the Bush administration during a showdown over the legality of a government surveillance programme. He also withstood withering criticism from Democrats over his handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation last year. If he swears to a congressional committee that the president put undue pressure on him to end an ongoing Flynn investigation, his word will pack a punch. The ""I"" word - impeachment - has already been broached by politicians as moderate as independent Senator Angus King of Maine. If this were a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, articles of impeachment would likely be in the drafting process. Republicans still call the shots in Congress, however, and it's a significant leap to get them to abandon the Trump presidency and any hope of advancing their agenda for the foreseeable future. But some, like Senator John McCain - who said this has become a scandal of ""Watergate size and scale"" - are clearly wavering. The former Republican presidential nominee is a bit of a wild card, of course. For the rank-and-file to turn on the president will require them to admit their complicity in a failed presidency. They rallied behind Trump at the Republican National Convention. They looked past his feud with a Gold Star family and his disparaging attacks on Alicia Machado, the former beauty queen. They bit their tongues after the Access Hollywood video. They may have supported other candidates during the Republican primary, but they carried Mr Trump's water through the general election. Now the well is running dry. Donald Trump may yet survive these revelations. Mr Comey's memos could turn out to be paper tigers, with teeth not nearly as sharp as Tuesday's sneak preview indicated. He could, under oath, soft-pedal his conclusions. Republicans might decide it's better to stick with the president than run for the exits.  At the very least, however, it's becoming clear that Teflon Don is no longer untouchable. His future is no longer clear. A storm is brewing, and it's going to get worse for their party before it gets better.  The Trump White House has now settled on its defence of the president's meeting with the Russian delegation, in which he reportedly revealed classified information to his guests. In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning the president framed any disclosure of intelligence information as a calculated move to advance US national security priorities. In a press conference hours later, National Security Adviser HR McMaster said Mr Trump's revelations were ""wholly appropriate"". This was always going to be the most effective response, as the president has broad powers to declassify whatever he deems necessary. As the old Richard Nixon line goes: ""When the president does it, that means it is not illegal"". The president's explanation is not absolution, however. A wave of the hand on Twitter isn't going to make this story go away any time soon. Here are six reasons why.  The impeachment question has been mentioned in this case too. Shortly after the Washington Post story detailing the allegations broke, there were cries of ""treason"" from Mr Trump's more vociferous critics and calls for immediate removal from office. The charge that Mr Trump, through ignorance or boastfulness, casually disclosed highly classified intelligence for no reason may not be a criminal offence, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't create a political controversy that could, in a worst-case scenario for the president, end in his impeachment. The process for impeachment for ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" as outlined in the US constitution is a political act. A simple majority of the House of Representatives can impeach, initiating a trial in the Senate and a two-thirds vote necessarily for removal.  As the writers of Lawfare Blog point out, Mr Trump's opponents could accuse him of violations of his oath of office to ""preserve, protect, and defend"" the US constitution - a catch-all category cited in the three previous times a president has been seriously threatened with impeachment. Just because it's possible, however, doesn't mean it's likely. And again, it has nothing to do with the law and everything to do with politics - and how the story plays out from here. Like Indiana Jones looking at a chamber full of snakes, many in the Trump White House must be muttering to themselves: ""Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?"" Allegations of cosier-than-desired relations with the US geopolitical adversary have bedevilled Mr Trump since the early days of his presidential campaign.  He's been questioned about the praise he's lavished on President Vladimir Putin, some of his aides are caught up in the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the US 2016 election, his attorney general was forced to recuse himself because of an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak and his first national security adviser was fired for obfuscating about his Russia ties (and is one of the people under FBI investigation to boot). All of this was hanging in the air as Mr Trump met with Mr Kislyak and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov last week, just hours after he fired James Comey, the FBI director overseeing the Russia investigation. US press was barred from attending, and the only photos that were released came from the Russian state-run news service. It was never going to be a good look. Now, in light of the Washington Post's revelations, it's a terrible one. Mr Trump's tweets explained that he was ""sharing"" information with the Russian officials in order to foster co-operation on important global issues like the fight against the so-called Islamic State. As Mr Trump points out, he has the ""absolute right"" to do so.  The fact that it's the Russians involved, however, means the story will pack that much more powerful a punch. Back in January Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that Israeli intelligence officials were concerned about sharing sensitive information with the Trump administration because of ""fears of a leakage"" to Russia. Yeah, about that... According to the Washington Post report, Mr Trump may have disclosed information provided to the US by a ""key ally"" that has ""access to the inner workings of the Islamic State"". According to multiple news reports that ally was none other than Israel. That fits in with the Post's original story, which did not identify the ally but said ""it has previously voiced frustration with Washington's inability to safeguard sensitive information related to Iraq and Syria"". One US official said it was potentially a ""blow"" to the US relationship with that ally. Israel's ambassador in Washington has since said it has ""full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the US"", but the damage may be done. If key US allies become reluctant to share intelligence data with the US, that would be a significant blow to the nation's national security - even if the details of this particular story are never fully established.  Off the record, one Israeli intelligence official told Buzzfeed News that the story is ""our worst fears confirmed"". Throw in last week's Trump tweet implying that he - or someone - may have ""tapes"" of conversations made in the White House, and the result may be a chilling effect on US foreign relations across the board. This sharing of classified information with the Russians should also be viewed in the context of what has become a simmering feud between the president and members of the intelligence community. Shortly after he tweeted out that two-part explanation of his White House meeting with the Russians, Mr Trump sent another message on a familiar theme - leaks. ""I have been asking Director Comey and others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community..."" Back in January then-President-elect Trump sent a tweet comparing leaky intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.  The president is clearly angered by what he views as a litany of embarrassing disclosures -about phone calls with leaders of Australia and Mexico, conversations his national security adviser had with the Russian ambassador and salacious details from a Trump-Russia dossier circulated among intelligence officials. The president has threatened massive re-organisation of the US intelligence bureaucracy and an aggressive investigation into the source of the leaks - and it appears members of that community are striking back. Monday evening, upon hearing of details about the Washington Post story, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine echoed a familiar lament. ""Can we have a crisis-free day?"" she said. ""That's all I'm asking."" On Tuesday morning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a similar take. ""We could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things,"" he told Bloomberg Television, ""so we can focus on our agenda, which is deregulation, tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare."" A few of the Republican usual suspects who have been more outspoken in their criticism are continuing on that tack.  Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan tweeted that the White House should share ""details of the president's meeting"" with Congress. Once again Senator John McCain of Arizona found something the president did ""deeply disturbing"". Barring further revelations, however, the president has constructed a defence around which Republicans can rally. While members of Mr Trump's party may grouse about the ongoing administration fiascos, previous complaints have been followed by inaction. Until there is evidence to the contrary, this time looks to be no different.  Last week reporters raged over the fact that White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, put forward an explanation regarding why the president had fired FBI Director James Comey that was completely undercut within moments of Mr Trump opening his mouth in a sit-down interview on Thursday with NBC News. The president would later tweet that because he is a ""very active president"" his press team can't be relied upon to convey his positions with ""perfect accuracy"". ""Why were so many people giving answers that just weren't correct?"" Jonathan Karl asked Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""Were you guys in the dark?"" Needless to say reporters this week took the early White House spin that Mr Trump only discussed ""common threats"" with the Russians, per Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell, with more than a grain of salt. It appears their scepticism was at least partially validated when, on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump said he had shared ""facts pertaining to terrorism"" with Russia. Presidents and the media typically have an adversarial relationship, but this White House is rapidly burning through any residual goodwill it may have had.  Given that Mr Trump and his team often refer to the press as the ""opposition party"", however, they may not lose much sleep over this development.

"North Korea missile tests: US warns against supporting Pyongyang The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has vowed to ""call out"" states backing North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, as tensions continue.  ""You either support North Korea or you support us,"" she said, suggesting some countries were failing to adhere to UN-imposed sanctions. Her comments came ahead of an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. The council on Monday unanimously condemned North Korea's latest missile test and warned of new sanctions. North Korea said the missile it had tested on Sunday was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead. It flew some 700km (435 miles), reaching an altitude of 2,000km and landing in the sea west of Japan. South Korea was unable to verify the claims. Speaking before a closed-door Security Council meeting on Tuesday, Mrs Haley warned countries giving their backing to North Korea to stop or face the consequences.  ""If you are a country that is supplying or supporting North Korea, we will call you out on it. We will make sure that everyone knows who you are and we will target those sanctions towards you as well,"" she told reporters, flanked by the UN ambassadors to Japan and South Korea.   Washington, she said, would consider talks with Pyongyang only if the country halted all nuclear and ballistic missile tests.  She confirmed that the US and China - North Korea's only ally in the region - were working together on a new Security Council resolution targeting North Korea. ""Sanctions is something that we are looking at and we are going to continue to see where that takes us."" In a statement on Monday, the 15-member council demanded that Pyongyang conduct no further ballistic missile tests.  The Council has imposed six sets of sanctions against the North since 2006. North Korea is known to be developing both nuclear weapons - it has conducted five nuclear tests - and the missiles capable of delivering those weapons to their target. Both are in defiance of UN sanctions. But it remains unclear whether it has the ability to make the weapons small enough to be mounted on a rocket, and it has never tested an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) which could reach, for example, the US. ICBM's are considered to have a range of about 6,000km, but analysts believe the missile tested on Sunday would have travelled about 4,000km if it had been fired at a standard trajectory rather than upwards.",Wednesday 17 May 2017,17-May-17,US warns against support for N Korea,"The US ambassador to the UN vows to ""call out"" countries backing Pyongyang and its nuclear programme.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39943619
"Canada government tables airline passenger bill of rights Canada is moving to crack down on ""shoddy treatment"" and overbooking on flights.  Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau has introduced legislation that will set national standard for how passengers are treated by airlines.  Mr Garneau says the bill will give the government the tools it needs to protect air travellers.  The proposed new rules will apply to any airline operating flights in and out of Canada.  The minister said the details related to passenger rights in instances like overbooking and bumping are still being developed but that there must be compensation in those cases.  ""I am convinced the air carriers will take note of these new measures protecting passengers rights, and will know if they don't change some of their practices there will be repercussions,"" he said.  He said air carriers will not be able to involuntarily remove from flights people who have a legitimate right to travel.  ""That is a critical factor. If somebody has bought a ticket for a particular flight that person cannot be removed from that flight. This is non negotiable.""  The proposed rules would set minimum compensation standards for overbooked flights and lost or damaged luggage, and set out how airlines must treat passengers when a flight is delayed or cancelled in situation within the airline's control or during events like bad weather. It will also set standards for tarmac delays.   Mr Garneau announced plans for the rights bill last year, but restated the promise as footage of a US passenger being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight made global headlines in April.  Canadian news has since been filled with stories of people coming forward with travel woes.  Ian Jack, of the Canadian Automobile Association, which lobbies for passenger rights, said it is too early to say whether the minister's promises will mean better travel for passengers because the ""devil is in the details"".  The Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) will establish the details such as levels of compensation and the rules around bumping over the next few months. ""The jury's out on whether they are going to be able to deliver,"" said Mr Jack.  ""There's a big difference between the concept of compensation and whether you're going to be offered a coffee coupon or $750. That has still to be worked out.""  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says some 60 countries have some form of passenger rights protection already in place.  The CTA receives an average of about 50 complaints a year from passengers saying they were denied boarding.   Both the European Union and the US have compensation rules for passengers bumped from flights.

"Mississippi man jailed for transgender killing A Mississippi man has been sentenced for killing a transgender woman in the first US federal prosecution of a hate crime based on gender identity. Joshua Vallum was given 49 years in prison for the murder of his 17-year-old ex-girlfriend Mercedes Williamson. Vallum pleaded guilty to stabbing and bludgeoning Mercedes after friends learned of their relationship. Transgender-rights advocates say there is an ""epidemic of violence"" against the minority community. ""Today's sentencing reflects the importance of holding individuals accountable when they commit violent acts against transgender individuals,"" US Attorney General Sessions said in a written statement.  ""The Justice Department will continue its efforts to vindicate the rights of those individuals who are affected by bias motivated crimes,"" the former Alabama congressman added. In 2009 Congress expanded the federal hate crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's sexual orientation. This case, which began under the Obama administration, is the first federal hate crime prosecution based on a victim's gender identity.  The 29-year-old member of the Latin Gangs street gang had secretly been romantically involved with Mercedes during the summer of 2014, he admitted to prosecutors. He knew that she was transitioning from male to female at the time, despite initially telling officers that he ""blacked out"" and killed her after seeing her penis. Experts refer to this legal technique as the ""gay panic"" or ""trans panic"" defence. After their relationship had ended, Vallum made the decision kill Mercedes fearing retribution from other gang members who had discovered their past. He lured her to his father's home, where he shocked her with a stun gun, then stabbed her and struck her with a hammer as she tried to flee. During sentencing, Vallum pleaded for forgiveness from Mercedes' family, although none of them were in court. ""Every day, I live with the guilt and regret of my actions,"" Vallum said.  ""If I could bring back Mercedes by giving up my life, I would gladly do so."" At least nine transgender people have died in 2017 in the US, according to LGBT advocates.",Wednesday 17 May 2017,17-May-17,US man sentenced for transgender killing,It is the first successful federal hate crime prosecution based on the victim's sexual identity.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39938428
"Hebe de Bonafini: Head of Argentina Mothers of Plaza de Mayo group indicted A judge in Argentina has indicted the head of human rights organisation the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. Hebe de Bonafini, 88, has been charged with misusing public funds allocated to a social housing project.  The programme, created by former President Cristina Fernández, was managed by Mrs De Bonafini's foundation, a world-famous collective of mothers looking for children who disappeared during the dictatorship.  She maintains her innocence.  As a close ally of the ex-president, she says the case against her is politically motivated and orchestrated by current President Mauricio Macri, who came into power in 2015.  ""Thank you Macri for giving me the honour of being accused,"" she said sarcastically on Monday. Prosecutors allege that about $13m (£10m) of public funding in the Shared Dreams programme was diverted inappropriately. Her former aide, Sergio Schoklender, will also be investigated, according to local media.  Mrs De Bonafini has previously refused to appear in court to give evidence. The movement of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo is highly lauded in Argentina for its human rights work. It emerged when a military junta ruled the country (1976 -1983) and a group of women paraded around the central square in Buenos Aires to draw attention to their missing children.  Its a tradition they keep, every Thursday, to this day.  Mrs Bonafini has two sons who were ""disappeared"" by the military government. The mothers group has previously said they wanted to do some of the work their children, who were mostly left-wing activists, would have ended up doing if they were alive. The $53m Shared Dreams programme was devised to build housing, schools and health centres in low-income neighbourhoods. It was abruptly halted in 2011. Investigations then revealed that Mr Schoklender was the major shareholder in Meldorek, the construction company used by the Mothers.",Wednesday 17 May 2017,17-May-17,Head of Argentine mothers group charged,The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo was set up by mums looking for children who vanished in the dictatorship.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39933904
"Maria Sharapova: French Open decides against giving former champion a wildcard   Maria Sharapova will miss the French Open after tournament officials decided not to give the two-time champion a wildcard. The Russian, 30, was ranked too low to gain direct entry as she continues her return from a 15-month drugs ban. ""There can be a wildcard for the return from injuries - there cannot be a wildcard for the return from doping,"" French Tennis Federation (FFT) chief Bernard Giudicelli Ferrandini said. The French Open begins on 28 May. Sharapova had been hoping to receive a wildcard either into the main draw or the qualifying tournament. ""I'm very sorry for Maria, very sorry for her fans,"" added Giudicelli Ferrandini. ""They might be very disappointed, she might be very disappointed, but it's my responsibility, my mission, to protect the high standards of the game played without any doubt on the result."" Shortly after learning of her Roland Garros snub, Sharapova withdrew injured from her second-round Italian Open match against Mirjana Lucic-Baroni.  Sharapova returned to action without a ranking last month and has since risen to 211 in the world after receiving wildcards in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome. That will be enough to at least earn a qualifying spot at Wimbledon next month. Sharapova needed to reach the semi-finals of the Italian Open to qualify for Wimbledon's main draw but retired in the second round on Tuesday when leading Lucic-Baroni 4-6 6-3 2-1. ""I apologise for having to withdraw from my match with a left thigh injury,"" she said. ""I will be getting all the necessary examinations to make sure it is not serious.""  Sharapova will now have to wait until 20 June to discover whether she is among the wildcards at the All England Club. The former world number one has not played a Grand Slam since she tested positive for heart disease drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open. That brought an initial two-year ban, later reduced to 15 months after the Court of Arbitration for Sport found she was not an ""intentional doper"". BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller The ongoing fight against doping is more important than the line-up for the French Open - that was the message from the French Federation's president.  It is a brave and principled decision, which will upset some fans and broadcasters. Ratings may suffer, but Roland Garros will ultimately be stronger for it.  How could the public take the sport's anti-doping message seriously if one of the Grand Slams had invited a player who was not ranked high enough because of time served for a doping offence? Sharapova has, in contrast, earned her place in qualifying for Wimbledon, even though injury has now deprived her of the chance to play herself into the main draw. And assuming she is fit, she is likely to want to play at least two warm-up events. The Lawn Tennis Association has already offered her a wildcard into the WTA event in Birmingham. If Sharapova also wants to play the week before, she has Nottingham and the Dutch town of Rosmalen to choose between.

"Diamond earrings sell for world record $57.4m A pair of diamond earrings have been sold at auction in Geneva for a record-breaking price of $57.4m (£44.4m). The pear-shaped jewels, nicknamed Apollo and Artemis, are almost 16 carats each.  The flawless stones mined in South Africa are perfectly matched except for their colour - Artemis is pink, and Apollo is blue.  Sotheby's chief auctioneer David Bennet said that coloured diamonds are extremely rare ""show stoppers"". ""These are in their own right extraordinarily rare stones, but taken together they are unprecedented, they are absolutely stunning,"" he said. The world's most expensive ear rings? Pink Star diamond sets new world record The earrings were bought by an anonymous buyer, media reports say, but will be kept as a pair. Apollo and Artemis differ in one crucial area - their respective prices. Apollo sold for $42.1m while Artemis went for $15.3m. The pure vivid blue of Apollo - from the Cullinan mine in South Africa - is rarer, and therefore worth more than the intense pink Artemis. The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the earrings were the stars of Geneva's spring jewellery auction and Sotheby's initially offered them separately, after they wrongly assumed that a buyer with the wherewithal for both might actually be rarer than the diamonds themselves.

"Martha McSally: Man 'threatened to shoot' Trump supporter A man in the US has been arrested after threatening to shoot a Republican congresswoman who supports President Donald Trump. Steve Martan allegedly called Martha McSally's office several times, making death threats and saying she should be careful if she visited Tucson, Arizona. FBI officials traced the calls back to his mobile phone. When they visited him, he said he was ""venting frustrations"" with Ms McSally's votes in support of Mr Trump.  A complaint filed with a local court alleges that Mr Martan called the congressional office three times, using expletives and making general threats such as saying her days were ""numbered"", as well as threats to wring Ms McSally's neck or shoot her. Ms McSally said the threats were ""especially sickening"" in view of the shooting of another congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson six years ago. Six people died in that attack in 2011, and a total of 13 were wounded. Ms Giffords survived the attack but spent time in an induced coma and suffered serious brain injury that left one of her arms paralysed and affected her speech. The man who shot her pleaded guilty on 19 counts of murder and attempted murder, and is serving seven life sentences plus 140 years. Ms Giffords has issued a statement saying that the threats against Ms McSally were ""reprehensible and deeply disturbing"". Ms McSally said: ""We can disagree about issues and policies. We should have robust debates about the future of our country. But threats of violence cross a clear line.""  Mr Martan has been released from custody, but will have to wear an electronic tag and is not permitted to contact Ms McSally or carry a gun, a local newspaper reported.

"UK ambassador's 'bruising' encounter with Austrian boar Diplomats are used to finding themselves in tricky situations. However, those tricky situations are usually confined to the treacherous waters of foreign relations, and tend not to involve an aggrieved wild boar. Which is possibly why when Leigh Turner, UK ambassador to Austria, heard the sounds of just such an animal heading towards him at high speed, it took a moment to decide exactly what to do next. But then, rampaging wild boar really only give a person one option. ""Not having prior experience of boar attacks, I ran,"" Mr Turner recounted in a blog reliving his experience in a Viennese park on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website. According to the blog, Mr Turner had been enjoying a relatively routine day up until the point he decided to go for a walk - braving the rain which had all but emptied the park of its usual visitors. Things took a turn for the exciting early on, when Mr Turner, who took over his posting in Austria last year, spotted a group of wild boar crossing a path ""about 100 metres ahead"" as they headed into the forest. ""In nine years in Germany and nearly four in Austria I had never seen wild boar so close up,"" Mr Turner enthused. Unfortunately for the diplomat, this was not to be his last encounter with wild boar on this particular day. Now he decided to go into the woods - and stumbled across a second group. Conscious of not frightening them, he turned and walked away slowly. One boar, however, had other ideas. ""Moments later I hear a noise behind me like galloping horse, and turn to see a massive wild boar, head down, charging straight at me,"" he wrote. ""Clearly, it can run faster than I can.  What to do?"" The answer came in the form of fallen tree trunks. After all, humans are surely better climbers than pigs?  ""I attempted to scale it and slipped on the wet wood, scratching and bruising myself in multiple locations as I scrambled to a place of safety,"" Mr Turner recalled. ""By the time I turned round, the boar (no doubt thinking 'that's got rid of that swine') had trotted back to join the rest of the group, which was melting back into the forest."" Luckily, Mr Turner did not make contact with the boar and only had a few ""self-inflicted"" injuries (wrapped, for good measure, in a ""pity-inducing splint"" by a kindly Austrian doctor). What's more, after a fair amount of research, he can now offer other walkers some excellent tips on how to avoid being gored by a boar, and has even managed to keep a sense of humour over the entire, bruising encounter.",Wednesday 17 May 2017,17-May-17,Massive boar chases UK ambassador,"Leigh Turner has shared details of the ""bruising"" encounter in a Viennese woodland.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39937822
"Chechnya accused of 'gay genocide' in ICC complaint Three French gay rights groups have accused the Russian republic of Chechnya of a policy of genocide towards gay people in a complaint filed at the International Criminal Court.  They have blamed Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov and state officials for a ""wave of persecution"".  They cited the case of a teenaged male thrown out of a ninth-storey window, allegedly because of his sexuality. Chechen officials have denied that gay people even exist in the republic. Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month backed an inquiry into the reported crackdown on gay people in Chechnya. But the three French groups have rejected Russia's internal investigation, and want the International Criminal Court in The Hague to start work before Russia withdraws from its jurisdiction in November. Reports of arbitrary arrests of gay men first surfaced last month in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.  The three groups highlighted the case of a 17-year-old gay youth allegedly thrown to his death from a ninth-floor window by an uncle supposedly anxious to salvage the family's honour.  They have accused President Kadyrov of setting up torture camps to exterminate homosexuals, Le Monde (in French) reported. It quoted the leader of Idaho France - one of the three groups instigating the ICC case - as saying the court was the only way they could pursue their grievances. Last week five gay rights activists were detained in Moscow as they tried to deliver a petition to the office of Russia's prosecutor general. Police said they were held because their action was unauthorised. The activists said more than two million people had signed the petition to investigate alleged torture and detentions of gay people in Chechnya. President Kadyrov has insisted that there are no ""people of non-traditional orientation"" (a term sometimes used to describe LGBT people in Russia) in the predominantly Muslim republic. Chechen officials also say the local police have not received any official complaints from alleged victims.

"Trump-Russia row: Putin offers to release meeting record Russian President Vladimir Putin has waded into the growing row surrounding US President Donald Trump and dealings with Russia. US media say Mr Trump passed on classified information to Russian officials last week, but Mr Putin says this is not the case. He said he would release a record of the meeting to Congress if requested. The news comes amid reports Mr Trump tried to influence an investigation into his team's links with Russia. US media have quoted a memo by former FBI director James Comey that reportedly says Mr Trump asked him to drop an inquiry into links between his ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Moscow. The fallout from both issues continues to consume Washington, with moves by Democrats to set up an independent commission is starting to gather momentum. As for Mr Trump, he told US Coast Guard Academy graduates in Connecticut: ""No politician in history has been treated worse or more unfairly."" Mr Trump met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at the White House last Wednesday. The meeting came amid an ongoing FBI inquiry and congressional hearings into possible Russian influence in the 2016 US election. It also came a day after Mr Trump dismissed Mr Comey from his post. On Monday, the Washington Post, followed by a number of other US outlets, said Mr Trump had given the Russian officials information relating to the Islamic State group (IS) that could have endangered the source of the information. The information was reportedly deemed so sensitive it had not been shared with key US partners, let alone Russia. Mr Trump later defended his right to share the information, and his national security adviser HR McMaster said the president's actions were ""wholly appropriate"". On Wednesday, Mr Putin joked that the meeting did not unfold as had been portrayed. ""I spoke to him [Mr Lavrov] today,"" he said. ""I'll be forced to issue him with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us."" While in charge at the FBI, Mr Comey was heading an investigation into possible Russian influence on the US election. The Russia story has already claimed one victim - Mr Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired after misleading the government over his meetings with Mr Kislyak. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Mr Comey had written a memo following a meeting with the president on 14 February, saying that Mr Trump had asked him to close an investigation into Mr Flynn's actions.  He reportedly shared this memo with top FBI associates. ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,"" the president told Mr Comey, according to accounts of the memo. ""He is a good guy."" Mr Comey did not respond to his request, according to this account, but replied: ""I agree he is a good guy."" The FBI chief was later fired by Mr Trump. The official reason was over his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while at the state department. But Mr Trump said in an interview last week that ""this Russian thing"" was on his mind as he made the decision. The White House denied the allegation that Mr Trump had tried to influence Mr Comey.  ""The president has never asked Mr Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" it said. A White House official also pointed out that acting FBI director Andrew McCabe had testified last week that there had been ""no effort to impede our investigation to date"". The Senate's Intelligence Committee said it had asked Mr Comey to appear before the panel to testify, and had asked the FBI for all relevant documents, including the memo. House Oversight Committee chair Jason Chaffetz, a senior Republican, said the memo and related documents ""raise questions as to whether the president attempted to influence or impede the FBI's investigation"". On Wednesday, the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, said it was crucial to let investigations run their course before rushing to judgment. But Democratic members of the House of Representatives said they would try and force a vote to create an independent commission into the Russia ties. Two Republicans backed the move, they said. Wall Street reacted nervously on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones index suffering its biggest one-day drop since September. Adam Schiff, the highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said this intervention by Mr Trump, if confirmed, amounted to ""interference or obstruction of the investigation"". The key legal statute is 18 US Code Section 1512, which contains a broad definition allowing charges to be brought against someone who ""obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so"". It has been pointed out that Mr Trump did have the legal authority to fire Mr Comey, but there is a legal precedent for otherwise lawful acts to be considered an obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions, the New York Times says. Legal experts have told the Washington Post that that is not clear in this case as intent is difficult to prove.  However, former federal prosecutor Samuel Buell told the Times: ""The evidence of improper purpose has gotten much stronger since the day of Comey's firing.  ""Trump has made admissions about that. And we now have evidence that he may have indicated an improper purpose previously in his communications with Comey about the Russia investigation.""",Thursday 18 May 2017,18-May-17,Putin wades into Trump-Russia row,Russia's president offers to release a record of his officials' White House meeting with Mr Trump.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39948870

"Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice? Reports that Donald Trump asked former FBI director James Comey to shut down a federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn have added weight to a possible obstruction of justice case against the president, law professors say. According to a New York Times account of a memo written by Mr Comey, Mr Trump told the FBI director during a private Oval Office meeting in February: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go... He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Allegations of obstruction of justice were first levelled in the Comey affair last week, when Mr Trump fired the FBI director and admitted he had taken the ""thing with Trump and Russia"" into account in his decision. But the case was clouded by a string of contradictory explanations from the White House. ""It was hard to make the obstruction of justice case with the sacking alone,"" said Alex Whiting, a Harvard Law professor and former federal prosecutor. ""The president had clear legal authority and there were arguably proper, or at least other, reasons put forward for firing him. But with this development, that argument becomes much harder to make."" Mr Trump's apparent attempt to lean on Mr Comey to close the investigation was ""very close to obstruction of justice"", Mr Whiting said, ""but still isn't conclusive"".  The White House disputed the Times report, claiming it was ""not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation"". Under the law, obstruction of justice is any interference with a judicial or congressional proceeding. It is commonly applied in cases where someone has tampered with evidence, intimidated a witness, or failed to report a crime, but the statute requires there to be a corrupt intent behind the action. There are cases in which an official might legitimately request that prosecutors drop a case, in order for example to avoid the disclosure of classified information. Mr Trump's comments, and the context in which he said them, would have to be assessed for evidence of intent, said David Sklansky, a Stanford law professor.  ""This isn't a smoking gun on its own, but I'm not sure you can ever have a smoking gun when it comes to intent,"" he said. ""You prove intent by putting together what someone said with circumstantial evidence and what we know about their actions. ""For example, is it more reasonable to infer, based on what we know about the president, that he was concerned the FBI wasn't prudently shepherding its resources, or is it more reasonable to assume that he was worried about something coming out that would make him or an associate look bad?"" Even if the latter seems apparent, it remains difficult to prove. Circumstantially, the president has several times expressed dissatisfaction with the FBI's Russia investigation. Last week, after the White House said Mr Comey was fired because of his conduct in the Hillary Clinton email affair and not the Russia investigation, Trump appeared to reverse the story, telling NBC News: ""And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story'."" Then on Tuesday there was the addition of Mr Comey's memo.  ""The memo from Mr Comey seems to be consistent with the president sacking him and saying later that he had Russia in mind when he made the decision,"" said Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at University of North Carolina who testified at the Clinton impeachment hearings. ""It sounds now as if those events are connected, and that makes the whole situation more disturbing. Was the president using his unique office to suggest to the head of the FBI that he should stop an investigation?"" The Comey memo shifted the legal burden towards the president to explain his actions, Mr Gerhardt said, and put a ""heightened burden on Congress to investigate"". Obstruction of justice is a criminal offence, but criminal proceedings against the president are highly unlikely, said Mr Sklansky.  ""The Department of Justice has concluded in the past that bringing a criminal case against a sitting president would be constitutionally unfeasible,"" he said. ""If there is going to be some kind of legal action against the president it will be an impeachment."" Of the three presidents who have faced impeachment proceedings, two have been accused of obstruction of justice: Richard Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 2000. Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. The Senate voted on Mr Clinton's impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky scandal but fell 17 votes short of removing him from office. The burden of proof for impeachment proceedings is lower than for a criminal case, where corrupt intent must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The constitution states that for an impeachment, Congress must find that a president has committed ""high crimes and misdemeanours"". A successful impeachment requires a majority vote in the House and a two-thirds vote in the Senate, with a trial in-between. With both chambers currently controlled by the Republican party, on purely political grounds an impeachment of Mr Trump, as things stand, seems unlikely.  ""The major political question is what it will take to convince large numbers of Republicans that they should no longer support Trump,"" said Mr Sklansky. ""And I don't think we know the answer to that yet."" If the answer takes the form of unwavering support for the president the country could find itself in crisis, said Pamela Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor.

"Global stock markets fall as Trump turmoil intensifies Big falls on US stock markets have dragged down Asian shares over fears the political controversy surrounding President Trump will blunt his ability to deliver tax and regulatory reform. Wall Street's three main indexes shed more than 1.7%, and the dollar erased most gains made since his election. Asia's main stock markets also fell following the losses in New York. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.3% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.6%. That follows the S&P 500's biggest one-day fall since September. It closed 1.8% lower at 2,357 points.  But the biggest plunge was the tech-heavy Nasdaq which lost 2.6% to 6,011. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader in Sydney said the falls in Asia were ""all about President Trump"".  Optimism over the Trump administration's pro-growth policies had driven a sharp rally in US stocks since his election in November. But the row over the firing of FBI director James Comey, and growing scepticism about Mr Trump's ability to push major policies through Congress has cast a cloud over markets. Mr McKenna said the uncertainty could continue for few days yet with Mr Comey due to address a congressional committee next week. The concerns are shared by traders on Wall Street. ""It's kind of worrisome as it could take time to muddle through this,"" said Joseph Benanti, managing director, at share trader Rosenblatt Securities, in New York. Although the Oval Office has furiously denied wrongdoing over Mr Comey's sacking and claims Mr Trump passed on sensitive intelligence information to Russia, some commentators have even spoken about impeachment. ""Calls for President Trump to be impeached are growing louder and that has created a long overdue sense of fear in markets,"" said market analyst Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group.  Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said investors are having to ""digest the latest real-life episode of House of Cards"". At the very least, analysts say, it will all be a distraction for the administration and may stall the introduction of spending plans and market-friendly legislation. However, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, insisted that the administration's legislative agenda was not becoming paralysed, blaming ""some people out there who want to harm the president"". Financial stocks, big risers over the last few months, bore the brunt of Wednesday's share price falls. Goldman Sachs fell more than 5% and JP Morgan Chase fell 3.8%. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower. However, utilities and real estate sectors - preferred investment options in times of uncertainty due to their slow but predictable growth - were higher.  Gold, another haven asset, rose 0.9%, and the so-called ""fear index"", the VIX, reached its highest level in nearly one month. On the currency markets, the dollar was down 0.6% against the euro and 0.35% lower against the pound. The greenback fell almost 1.9% against the Japanese yen, which has been a traditional haven for risk-averse investors.  The dollar index, which tracks the value of the currency against a basket of currencies, is down 0.6% to 97.5, its weakest since November.  Jeremy Bryan, Gradient Investments, said the uncertainty could continue through the summer and beyond. ""We're largely through the earnings season, so political uncertainty is probably going to be the largest source of risk in the next three to six months,"" he said.",Thursday 18 May 2017,18-May-17,Wall Street falls as political fears grow,Share prices and the dollar fall amid fears political turmoil will stall Donald Trump's reforms.,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39953112
"Iran nuclear: Trump extends Obama's 'worst deal ever' Donald Trump's White House has renewed sanctions relief for Iran, despite the US president's past criticism. The easing of sanctions is part of a crucial nuclear deal brokered in 2015 under then-President Barack Obama with five other world powers. Mr Trump has described the landmark agreement as the ""worst deal ever"". However, the US Treasury issued fresh sanctions against specific officials and a Chinese business with links to Iran's missile programme. The move means that sanctions preventing any US companies selling to or dealing with Iran will remain suspended for the time being. In return, Iran has pledged to restrict its nuclear activities, reducing its uranium enrichment, plutonium production plans, and allowing inspectors access to facilities. The new sanctions from the Treasury are much more specific in scope, targeting two senior Iranian defence officials and suppliers of missile equipment, in apparent retaliation for a recent missile test, and for Iran's support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. US citizens and entities are now banned from dealing with the officials and companies involved. However, the White House stopped short of failing to renew the waivers on more widespread sanctions, which are not permanent and were due to expire this week. This is the first time Mr Trump has been faced with the issue, after former President Obama renewed the agreement shortly before he left office. Mr Trump has consistently warned Iran over its missile activity, and has criticised the terms of the deal made by Mr Obama - at one point claiming his ""number one priority"" if elected would be ""to dismantle the disastrous deal"". But the other nations involved in the agreement - including China, Russia, and the UK - believe it is the best way to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon. Since Mr Trump's inauguration, his administration has also continued to certify to Congress that Iran is upholding its part of the deal, which it must do every 90 days. But in April, Mr Trump ordered a wider review of the nuclear deal, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iran ""remains a leading state sponsor of terror, through many platforms and methods"".  Tehran, however, has always argued it has no nuclear weapon ambitions and is using nuclear technology for energy purposes.",Thursday 18 May 2017,18-May-17,Trump extends 'worst' Iran nuclear deal,"Donald Trump extends sanctions relief for Iran he once called the ""worst deal ever"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39950827

"Macron cabinet: Women are half of France's new ministers French President Emmanuel Macron has unveiled a gender-balanced cabinet in accordance with an earlier pledge, with 11 of 22 posts taken by women. Sylvie Goulard is defence minister while Olympic fencing champion Laura Flessel is sports minister. Bruno Le Maire is economy minister, Gérard Collomb is interior minister and François Bayrou is justice minister. Mr Macron's decision to pluck figures from across the political spectrum has sent the French right into disarray. Mr Le Maire is a conservative moderate, Mr Collomb is the Socialist mayor of Lyon and Mr Bayrou is a veteran centrist. Some 170 elected officials from the right were earlier criticised by hundreds of other lawmakers after they signed a statement backing Mr Macron. One accused Mr Macron of ""blowing up"" the political landscape. France's new president will hope his team delivers a majority in parliamentary elections next month. He delivered on his pledge of a cabinet of parity - though only one of the top five posts, that of defence, went to a woman. Other ministerial appointees include Jean-Yves Le Drian, in charge of defence under President François Hollande, who will become foreign minister. Nicolas Hulot, a well-known environmentalist, becomes ecology minister. Long-time Macron supporter and campaign manager Richard Ferrand is rewarded with the territorial cohesion portfolio. Other ministerial appointees include: Marlène Schiappa, whose successful blog Maman Works saw her dubbed the ""spokeswoman for working mums"", becomes junior minister for equality between women and men. As well as the political centre ground, Mr Macron also took in figures from the left. The announcement was delayed after candidates were background-checked for their tax records and any potential conflicts of interest. It comes amid consternation among forces of both the left and right at Mr Macron's offer to join him in his political project of bridging the divide. After he named Republican Edouard Philippe as prime minister on Monday, more than 170 elected conservatives agreed to sign up to the project, some claiming they were witnessing the ""transformation"" of politics. However, the Republican party rejected Mr Macron's ""outstretched hand"" ahead of upcoming election. It announced it was expelling Mr Philippe, along with new economy minister Bruno Le Maire, and Gérald Darmanin, who took responsibility for public accounts. In response, Mr Le Maire said he had ""chosen to serve"" and said he believed ""France is worth more than all the [political] parties"". Ahead of the June legislative elections, Republican campaign chief François Baroin accused Mr Macron of ""putting a bomb under politics rather than remodelling it"". The initiative has also been criticised on the left, with defeated Socialist presidential candidate Benoît Hamon among the dissenters. ""Who can think that the left will pull itself together if it is part of a coalition led by a member of the Republican party?"" he said. Separately, Mr Macron met the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, to start talks on an ""ambitious European policy"". The new president had promised to reform the EU while remaining an ardent supporter. Mr Tusk told the French leader: ""Europe needs your energy, your imagination and your courage.""",Thursday 18 May 2017,18-May-17,Women are half of Macron's new line-up,"They include its new defence, sport and labour ministers in a cabinet spanning the political spectrum.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39948523

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law. By Alastair Lawson All times stated are UK US stocks saw their worst day in monthsafter the White House found itself engulfed in fresh controversy. Mr Trump's plans to cut taxes and loosen regulation may now be delayed, or simply not come to fruition, some investors fear. By the closing bell all the major indices were sharply lower, with the Dow Jones down 370 points or 1.76% at 20,609,the S&P; 500 down 43 points or 1.81% at 2,357, and the Nasdaq was 158.63 points or 2.57% lower at 6,011. Bank stocks - which have outperformed the rest of the market in recent months - suffered most. Bank of America was down 5.9%, Goldman Sachs lost 5%, and Wells Fargo slipped 1.9%. President Trump will interview four candidates for the position of director of the FBI later today, White House spokesman Sean Spicer has informed reporters.  Speaking on board Air Force One with Mr Trump, Mr Spicer said the president would meet acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman and former senior FBI official Richard McFeely.  The position became vacant after Mr Trump fired James Comey.  This press release just dropped in BBC inboxes: The American Civil Liberties Union today filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Justice Department and FBI seeking the memo by former FBI Director James Comey describing his February meeting with President Trump in which Trump reportedly asked Comey to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to Russia.  “There are serious concerns that the president may have improperly tried to obstruct an FBI investigation. The public has a right to know if that’s true,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project.  The past seven days have been the most bizarre week of the US presidency since the dark days of Watergate, says columnist Max Boot in the Los Angeles Times, with 9-16 May becoming known as ""the seven days that shook the world"".

""[But] t is too soon to say this is the beginning of the end for a president who has already defied predictions of his political demise. Impeachment still is a long shot in a Congress so firmly dominated by the president's own party. But it is no longer unthinkable,"" he writes.

The president has only been in office 117 days, Boot concludes, ""but he has already overstayed his welcome"".

""For the good of the country, he should resign before our new national nightmare gets worse,"" he writes.  Watch BBC World News America
with Laura Trevelyan tonight for the latest updates from Washington and beyond.  She'll be speaking with the BBC's Nada Tawfik, who has just been to Nashville, Tennessee to hear what Trump supporters think of his presidency. Just to remind you, this is what members of Trump's own party have said about the 
allegations that Trump asked Comey to drop the FBI investigation. Congressman Paul Ryan: ""We need the facts... I'm sure we're going to go on to hear from Mr Comey about why, if this happened as he allegedly describes, why didn't he take action at the time."" Congressman Justin Amash: If true it would merit impeachment, he says, adding ""but everybody gets a fair trial in this country"". Senator John McCain: ""It's just another scandal that unfortunately continues every - it's now accelerating. Watergate took months. This thing seems to be taking hours."" Our congressional producer Suzanne Kianpour is on Capitol Hill speaking with lawmakers.  Here's what some of them have been saying. That's what one of Mr Trump's cabinet suggested to him today. The president was given a ceremonial sabre as a gift at the end of the graduation ceremony at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut. When he sat back down, his Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly suggested ""you can use that on the press"". The comment was heard by reporters at the event thanks to his microphone. You can hear what he said - just - in this clip. If Mr Trump did indeed ask the head of the FBI to ease off his investigation into a member of the government, as is being alleged, would that mean Mr Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice? Well...it all depends on his intent. And while obstruction of justice is a criminal offence, criminal proceedings against the president are highly unlikely. We put together an explainer on this - you can read it here. White House spokesman Sean Spicer is denying that James Comey was asked by Mr Trump to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn and possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. He added that the president has ""been very clear on this"" and that the account of the conversation as reported was ""not accurate"". As the White House readies itself for Trump's first trip abroad as president, Reuters has profiled how the president is preparing. One insight they've found is that Trump likes to read his name in official documents: Conversations with some officials who have briefed Trump and others who are aware of how he absorbs information portray a president with a short attention span. He likes single-page memos and visual aids like maps, charts, graphs and photos. National Security Council officials have strategically included Trump's name in ""as many paragraphs as we can because he keeps reading if he's mentioned,"" according to one source, who relayed conversations he had with NSC officials. Read the full Reuters report here. So says Jason Chaffetz, the House of Representatives oversight committee chairman. This doesn't mean for definite that the former FBI chief will appear, and whether he will detail what was in a memo he reportedly wrote after meeting Mr Trump. But the invite to him is out there... There's been a lot of talk today in financial forums about the stock markets being “rattled” by the Trump news, our business producer in New York John Mervin reports. But he points out that the response may be a bit overblown. ""The stock market is overdue a correction anyway, by most measures of how often corrections take place"", he says.      We may have heard him speak in Connecticut earlier, but the president hasn't chosen to make his voice on heard on Twitter in some time. This was the last thing he posted there, 22 hours ago: Such long Twitter silences from him are unusual. But it's not a record silence for him, as the Washington Post points out - if it gets to 6.35pm BST on Thursday and he still hasn't, it will be a record. As the Post says: ""When he comes back to Twitter, he often levels a complaint about what was happening while he was offline."" What would he have to complain about now? Radio 4 PM The White House has denied a report that President Trump tried to persuade the FBI to end its investigation into former aide
Michael Flynn.  This is the second Trump crisis in the last 24 hours, following
news that the president shared sensitive material with Russian diplomats.  But
how do Republican voters feel about these allegations? We spoke to Trump
supporters and commentators to find out their take on the current mood in
Washington. In case you missed it, Mr Trump said earlier that no other politician had been treated this badly. It's fair to say the claim has been met with some scepticism. The news organisation ProPublica has just published an interesting story - they chartered a boat and took it out to sea near Donald Trump's private Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he has welcomed foreign leaders. They found that the wi-fi network could have been cracked within minutes, though they opted not to. The incident raises more questions about security at a time the White House could probably do without more questions raising their head. Anthony Zurcher BBC North America reporter Donald Trump is angry, defiant and ready to defend his
record as president, in spite of the controversies currently swirling around
him. That was the key takeaway from the president’s Coast Guard
Academy commencement address, which started in a restrained manner but ended
with a bellicose flourish. The speech at times sounded more like one of his campaign
rallies than an address to men and women about to serve in the military. When
Mr Trump has been under fire in the past, however, he has upped the rhetoric
and sounded the populist battle cry that got him to the top. “Over the course of your life, you will find that things are
not always fair,” Mr Trump said in Connecticut. “You will find that things happen to you that
you do not deserve and that are not always warranted.” The answer, he said, was to “put your head down and fight,
fight, fight”. Donald Trump may be against the ropes. He may be facing an
uncertain future, with members of his own party quietly wondering whether to
cut their president adrift in hopes of saving their own political fortunes.  But if he goes down – alone or with his party at his
side – it looks like it’s going to be swinging. Check out our programme with presenters Christian Fraser, Michelle Fleury and Katty Kay.  The show begins on BBC World at 14:00e/ 19:00g. We’ll have special
coverage of the fallout from allegations that President Trump had asked
then-FBI Director James Comey to stop the investigation into Michael Flynn, and documented this exchange in a memo.  We’ll also hear from the New York
Times’ Eric Schmitt, and get reactions from PJ Crowley, a
former US state department spokesman. We'll be speaking to law professor Jonathan Turley, who will
weigh in on whether President Trump may have committed an impeachable offense. Steve Rosenberg BBC Moscow Correspondent You can't help feeling that the Kremlin is loving this. As the US administration - and the US superpower - staggers from one crisis to the next, Russia is watching and reveling in a political rival tearing itself apart. President Putin's comments today on America were full of sarcasm, and patronising put-downs. The Kremlin leader joked that he would have to reprimand his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who had allegedly received classified information from Donald Trump. Mr Lavrov, the president said, ""hadn't passed those secrets on to me or to Russia's secret services - and that was very bad of him!"" The Russian president said was ready to provide the US Senate and Congress with a transcript of Mr Lavrov's conversation with President Trump. But that was surely just another dig at America.

"Cockfighting: California seizure 'largest in US history' More than 7,000 birds have been seized during what is believed to be the largest cockfighting bust in US history, officials have said. Ten people were arrested after police officers and other personnel surrounded the remote property in a canyon in northern Los Angeles County. As well as the birds, firearms and drugs were found in the area. Cockfighting, which is illegal in every state in the US, involves two birds fighting each other to the death. Captain Jeff Parry, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, told a press conference: ""This, according to the experts here, is the largest seizure in US history of illegal cockfighting roosters.""  Most of those detained by his officers were ""at the lower level, the caretakers, entrusted with feeding and caring for the animals"", while the property owner was the main suspect. More arrests are expected, with some of those already detained caught after being chased through the canyon by mounted police officers. Video of the raid shows officers discovering bodies of birds which Cpt Parry said bore ""wounds consistent with cockfighting"". As well as the birds, a number of mobile fighting pit and ""hundreds of slashers"" - which are attached to the animals feet during fights - were discovered on the site, along with syringes and steroids. This is not the first time the property has been raided.

In January she tweeted that she wanted to move to Maryland after being released, a state where she previously lived. On Monday she tweeted: ""Two more days until the freedom of civilian life ^_^ Now hunting for private #healthcare like millions of Americans =P"". Manning will remain on active army duty while her military court conviction remains under appeal. She will have healthcare benefits but will be unpaid, the army says.

If the appeal is denied, she could be dishonourably discharged from the army, US media say. Manning was deployed in Iraq as an intelligence analyst when she leaked hundreds of thousands of files to Wikileaks.

On Monday she tweeted: ""Two more days until the freedom of civilian life ^_^ Now hunting for private #healthcare like millions of Americans =P"". Manning will remain on active army duty while her military court conviction remains under appeal. She will have healthcare benefits but will be unpaid, the army says. An online campaign set up by her attorney has raised $150,000 (£115,725) to pay for her living expenses for the first year after her release.  If the appeal is denied, she could be dishonourably discharged from the army, US media say. Manning was deployed in Iraq as an intelligence analyst when she leaked hundreds of thousands of files to Wikileaks.  Included in those files was video footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007, and many sensitive messages between US diplomats.

"Georgia death row inmate abuses witnesses at his execution A grinning death row inmate in the US state of Georgia used his final words at his execution to insult the witnesses. JW Ledford Jr's lawyers argued death by firing squad would be more humane as lethal injection would be too painful. But witnesses said the 45-year-old - who was served a 5,000-calorie last meal - showed no obvious discomfort as he was put to death early on Wednesday. He was convicted of knifing his 73-year-old neighbour to death in 1992.  His victim was the physician who delivered Ledford at birth. In Georgia's first execution this year, Ledford was pronounced dead at 01:17 after an injection of compounded barbiturate pentobarbital. Witnesses said the prisoner grinned as they entered the viewing area of the death chamber at the state prison in Jackson. Asked if he wished to make a final statement, Ledford appeared to quote from the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke, starring Paul Newman. ""What we have here is a failure to communicate,"" he said, a phrase uttered by the warden in the classic prison drama. ""Some men you just can't reach."" Ledford added: ""I am not the failure. You are the failure to communicate."" Still smiling, the prisoner said: ""You can kiss my white trash ass.""  Ledford continued talking, but his microphone was cut off. Witnesses said he shut his eyes, took several deep breaths and went still three minutes after the warden left the room. For his final meal on Friday, Ledford requested filet mignon wrapped in bacon with pepper jack cheese, large french fries, 10 chicken tenders with sauce, fried pork chops and a blooming onion. For dessert he had pecan pie, vanilla ice cream and sherbet, washed down with a Sprite, according to WGLC-TV, an Atlanta news station.  Should killers on death row get a last meal choice? Ledford robbed and murdered his neighbour, Dr Harry Johnston, stabbing him in the neck at his home on 31 January 1992. He then threatened the victim's wife before stealing money, four guns and vehicle from the house. The parole board rejected a request for clemency on Monday after Ledford's lawyers said he had a rough childhood and suffered an intellectual disability. His legal team had argued that a lethal injection would expose him to ""unconstitutional pain"" because he had been taking a drug for nerve pain which they said could alter his brain chemistry. They had argued that firing squad would be less painful, but a federal appeals court rejected the bid. Only three states allow for this option as an alternative to lethal injection - Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah.  According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia executed nine men last year, more than any other US state.

"Cannes Film Festival: Will Smith and Pedro Almodovar clash over Netflix The row over Netflix's place at Cannes has been reignited by its jury on the first day of the prestigious festival. For the first time, two Netflix films are competing for the Palme d'Or this year. However from next year, films will have to be released in French cinemas if they want to be considered. Jury president Pedro Almodovar agreed with the change, saying films should always be seen on the big screen and he was ""concerned"" about the issue. Tilda Swinton film Okja, and The Meyerowitz Stories - starring British actress Emma Thompson and Ben Stiller - are the first Netflix films to be shown at Cannes which are up for the main prize. The jury, which is also made up of Will Smith, Jessica Chastain and Paolo Sorrentino, will pick the Palme d'Or winner out of the 19 films in competition next weekend. Almodovar gave a passionate defence of cinema at the festival's opening press conference, saying he didn't think films should be considered for prizes if they had not had a cinema release. Reading from a pre-prepared statement, he said: ""All this doesn't mean I'm not open, or don't celebrate the new technology and the possibilities they offer to us. ""But while I'm alive, I will be fighting for the one thing the new generation is not aware of - the capacity of hypnosis of a large screen for a viewer."" The Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown director said he could not conceive the Palme d'Or - or any other prize - ""being given to a film and then not being able to see the film on a big screen"". He was applauded by the audience for his strong remarks. But Men in Black star Smith - giving an exuberant press conference performance in his debut as a jury member - disagreed with the cinema great. The star, who has a film in the works with the streaming giant, said his children both go to the movies twice a week and watch Netflix.  ""There's very little cross between going to the cinema and watching what they watch on Netflix,"" he mused, saying they were ""two different forms of entertainment"" and that Netflix ""brings a great amount of connectivity"". ""In my home, Netflix has been nothing but an absolute benefit. [They] watch films they otherwise wouldn't have seen. It has broadened my children's global cinematic comprehension.""

"Nigeria's Chibok girls: Schoolgirl 'not one of 276' A schoolgirl who escaped Nigeria's militant Islamists is not one of the 276 Chibok girls abducted in 2014, contrary to earlier reports, a presidential aide has told the BBC.  Although this girl went to the same school in Chibok, she was abducted in a separate incident, Femi Adesina said. The 15-year-old girl was found by government troops while she was escaping.  Boko Haram has captured thousands of people in north-eastern Nigeria. The abduction of the 276 Chibok girls is the most high-profile case but many others have never had any media attention or support, aid organisations say.  Three years since the abduction, 113 Chibok girls remain in captivity.  A total of 103 of the girls have been released so far, including 82 earlier this month in a prisoner swap.  The 82 girls, who met Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on 7 May, are expected to be reunited with their families later this week. They are believed to have been swapped for five Boko Haram commanders. Last month, President Buhari said the government remained ""in constant touch through negotiations, through local intelligence, to secure the release of the remaining girls and other abducted persons unharmed"". Aside from the Chibok girls, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of other people during its eight-year insurgency, which is aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate in north-eastern Nigeria. The government says more than 30,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes. Aid agencies are warning of a famine in the area, as people have not been able to farm for several years.",Thursday 18 May 2017,18-May-17,Lone Chibok girl escapes Boko Haram,Nigeria confirms one of the Chibok girls captured by Boko Haram militants in 2014 has escaped.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39954433
"Trump: FBI inquiry into Russia links 'hurts US terribly' President Donald Trump has said the decision to appoint a special counsel to oversee the inquiry into Russian influence on his election is hurting America ""terribly"". Speaking at a news conference in Washington, he denied any collusion with Russia during his election campaign last year. ""The entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion,"" he said. Former FBI chief Robert Mueller has been selected to lead the inquiry. Mr Mueller's appointment was welcomed by politicians from both sides. Calls for a special investigation had mounted after Mr Trump fired FBI Director James Comey last week.  On Thursday, Mr Trump denied trying to influence the investigation by sacking Mr Comey. ""Director Comey was very unpopular with most people,"" he suggested. ""I actually thought when I made that decision... that it would be a bipartisan decision because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side, not only the Republican side, that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey."" On Wednesday, Mr Trump had said no politician in history ""has been treated worse or more unfairly"" than himself. The announcement of a special counsel apparently took the White House by surprise, with Mr Trump only being informed of it after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had signed the order. The FBI and Congress are looking into potential links between Mr Trump's campaign team and Russia. Mr Mueller will take over the FBI investigation. US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to tip November's presidential election in favour of Mr Trump. Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that former Trump aide Michael Flynn told his transition team at the beginning of January - earlier than was previously thought - that he was under federal investigation for working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the election campaign. Mr Trump appointed Mr Flynn as his national security adviser weeks later despite the warning, but he was sacked after just 24 days. In his statement announcing Mr Mueller's appointment, Mr Rosenstein said: ""The public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command."" Mr Mueller, who will have wide-ranging powers, said simply: ""I accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability."" In announcing the appointment of a special counsel, Mr Rosenstein cited the ""unusual circumstances"" of the ongoing FBI Russia investigation. That's an understatement. The circumstances are not just unusual, they are unprecedented. The nation has never had an administration so embattled so early in its term. There have never been such grave allegations of electoral meddling by a foreign power in a US presidential election. Then again there has never been a president quite like Donald Trump. Now the Russia story enters a new, more serious phase. Robert Mueller has a sterling reputation in Washington, DC. He worked with Mr Comey when the latter served as deputy attorney general in George W Bush's administration. He understands pressure-cooker politics and knows how to navigate the corridors of power. He has wide latitude to conduct his investigation and bring criminal charges, if necessary.  While Mr Mueller is technically still part of the justice department and ultimately reports to Mr Trump, his stature is such that he is unlikely to be cowed by the president.  Independent investigations often take on a life of their own and can reach unexpected conclusions. With Mr Mueller in the game, the stakes just went up.

"Michel Temer: Brazil president 'won't quit' over bribe claim Brazil's Michel Temer is battling to save his presidency, amid allegations he authorised paying bribes to silence a witness in a huge corruption scandal. ""I will not resign. I know what I have done,"" he said in a televised address.  The turmoil caused the Brazilian stock market to have its worst day in over a decade, dropping 9%.  A year ago, Mr Temer took over office, after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. Now there are calls for his impeached, too.  Brazilian authorities have released an audio recording where Mr Temer appears to be discussing bribes.  The Supreme Court has approved an investigation into the allegations, but Mr Temer said he would prove his innocence. The audio came from a conversation between the president and Joesley Batista, the chairman of meat company JBS. It was originally obtained by O Globo newspaper, having been recorded by Mr Batista using a hidden device.   Much of the conversation is inaudible, but the key line comes when Mr Temer appears to discuss making payments to silence politician Eduardo Cunha, who is currently in jail.  When Mr Batista appears to imply he was paying Cunha to remain silent, the president was recorded saying, ""You need to keep that up, okay?""  It does not say what Cunha was being asked to keep quiet about. Mr Temer has said the footage is authentic, taken from a meeting in March, but he has strongly denied wrongdoing. In his address, he said, ""I never authorised any payments for someone to be silent. I did not buy anyone's silence. I fear no accusations."" Mr Temer is already deeply unpopular in Brazil but his centre-right party has been able to govern as part of a coalition. Opposition parties have been demanding snap elections and his impeachment. Various cities held protests on Thursday night, calling ""Fora Temer"" (Temer out).  Of more concern to Mr Temer may be signs of dissent within his administration, with a leader of his coalition allies, the social democrat PSDB, saying they were considering leaving the government. The allegations have rattled Brazilian markets, with investors concerned that if Mr Temer is forced out, his efforts to pull the economy out of recession would be derailed. The main Sao Paulo share index closed down 9% and the Brazilian currency suffered its worst day in 14 years.  The president will be eagerly seeking the backing of Congress to secure his future. However, his economic reforms, which he saw as legacy project but which were widely unpopular, have been stalled. If he were to be impeached, his successor would be his vice president.  But he does not have one.  This is because he himself was rapidly elevated from vice president to president, when Ms Rousseff was impeached almost exactly a year ago.  Instead the top job would fall to the Speaker of the Lower House, Rodrigo Maia, although another automatic accession would likely cause major protests and calls for an election.  The next election is scheduled for October 2018 and Mr Temer plans to hold his position until then.  It is the first time Mr Temer has become fully embroiled in the massive corruption inquiry known as Operation Car Wash. The probe, launched in March 2014, centres on companies that were offered deals with state oil giant Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and political party slush funds. The scandal has engulfed Brazilian politics, with a third of Mr Temer's cabinet under investigation for alleged corruption. Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is facing five charges. The man Mr Temer allegedly condoned the bribery of - Eduardo Cunha -  is in prison for corruption, money laundering and tax evasion. Both men played a key role in the downfall of former President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office accused of illegally manipulating government accounts. She denies all the charges.",Friday 19 May 2017,19-May-17,Embattled Brazil president 'won't quit',A defiant Michel Temer says he will prove his innocence of claims he authorised bribing a witness.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39968829
"Chris Cornell: Soundgarden star hanged himself Singer Chris Cornell died as a result of hanging himself, US officials have confirmed.  Cornell, 52, was found dead after performing in a concert with his band, Soundgarden, in Detroit on Wednesday evening. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed in a statement the frontman took his own life.   In an earlier statement, Cornell's representative Brian Bumbery had said his death was ""sudden and unexpected"". It also said the family would be working closely with the medical examiner and asked for privacy. A spokesperson for Detroit Police confirmed to the BBC they received a call just after midnight (05:00 BST) on Wednesday. ""He was found on the bathroom floor, our medical unit were called and he was pronounced dead on scene,"" a spokesperson said. ""A family friend went to go check on him and observed him on the bathroom floor. The body was transferred to the medical examiner's office."" The medical examiner's office said on Thursday that the cause of death had been determined as suicide by hanging, adding: ""A full autopsy report has not yet been completed."" The Soundgarden show was part of a wider tour and the group had a number of live dates scheduled for later this month. Sir Elton John led the tributes, tweeting: ""Shocked and saddened by the sudden death of @chriscornell. A great singer, songwriter and the loveliest man."" Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page added: ""RIP Chris Cornell. Incredibly talented, incredibly young, incredibly missed."" BBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt said he was taken aback by Cornell's death.  ""This is a hell of a shock, he'd been gigging frequently despite having a life that was quite extreme, and he was certainly in extremely good health, performing concerts and seemingly pretty much at the top of his game,"" he said. Cornell was born on 20 July 1964. As a solo artist, he released four studio albums - most recently 2015's Higher Truth. His biggest single in the UK was 2006's You Know My Name, which was the theme song to Casino Royale, which starred Daniel Craig. The track made him the first male American artist to write and perform the theme song for a James Bond movie. But he was perhaps most famous as the lead singer of Seattle band Soundgarden, which formed in 1984 and went on to release six studio albums. Last year, the band confirmed they were returning to the studio to record new material and a tour was announced for this year. On Wednesday evening, the Fox Theatre in Detroit tweeted pictures of the band while they were live on stage. Cornell himself tweeted about the show on Wednesday evening, writing: ""Finally back to Rock City!"" Soundgarden's most successful album in the UK was 1994's Superunknown, which reached number four in the chart. In 2001, he joined rock supergroup Audioslave, which consisted of Cornell on lead vocals, together with Rage Against The Machine members Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk (drums).  The group released three albums - all of which reached the top 20 in the UK - but disbanded in 2007.

"Syria war: US-led coalition 'strikes pro-Assad convoy' US-led coalition aircraft have bombed a convoy of pro-Syrian government forces in a remote area near the border with Jordan, US and rebel officials say. Syrian and Iranian-backed militiamen were reportedly moving towards the Tanf base, which is used by rebel fighters and Western special forces personnel. The US-backed Maghaweer al-Thawra rebel faction said the convoy was 27km (17 miles) away and contained four tanks. There was no immediate comment from the government or its allies. Rebel officials said earlier this week that hundreds of troops and militiamen were advancing into the sparsely-populated desert region, in an apparent attempt to halt recent rebel gains against so-called Islamic State (IS). A US defence official said the pro-government convoy had not responded to numerous warnings that it was ""getting too close to coalition forces"" stationed at Tanf. A telephone call was put into the Russian military, which backs President Bashar al-Assad. That was followed by a ""show of force"" by aircraft overhead and warning shots, the officials said. ""Then there was finally a strike against the lead portion of that movement."" Muzahem al-Saloum of Maghaweer al-Thawra told Reuters news agency that coalition jets had struck after rebel forces clashed with the convoy. ""We notified the coalition that we were being attacked by the Syrian army and Iranians in this point, and the coalition came and destroyed the advancing convoy,"" he said. The pro-opposition Palmyra News Network said a number of vehicles were destroyed and that there were casualties.  The US defence official told AFP that the strike did not signal a strategic shift for the coalition, which has focused on battling IS and has tried to avoid intervening in Syria's civil war.

"Roger Ailes: Fox News founder dies at 77 The ex-chairman and founder of Fox News Roger Ailes has died aged 77, his family says. A statement from his wife Elizabeth said she was ""profoundly sad and heartbroken"", calling him a ""patriot"". Mr Ailes ran Fox News for two decades and is credited with transforming it into arguably the most powerful voice in conservative media. But he stepped down last year after a number of female employees accused him of sexual harassment. At the time he said he was resigning because he had become a ""distraction"".  Roger Ailes and the dawn of hyper-partisan television What is going on at Fox News? Mrs Ailes' statement said: ""During a career that stretched over more than five decades, his work in entertainment, in politics, and in news affected the lives of many millions.  ""And so even as we mourn his death, we celebrate his life.""  The cause of his death has not been made public but CNN said he suffered a fall last week before slipping in to a coma, citing a family friend. Rupert Murdoch, the head of Fox News' parent company 21st Century Fox, said Mr Ailes played a ""huge role in shaping America's media over the last thirty years. ""Roger was a great patriot who never ceased fighting for his beliefs,"" he added. It would be hard to overstate the impact of Roger Ailes on American politics and culture over the past two decades.  As his bête noire the New York Times put it last year, he was kingmaker in a democracy that is meant to be king-proof, courted by presidential candidates and a confidante of Donald Trump.  Indeed, Trump's election owes a huge debt to the crusading, aggressive, and often conspiratorial agenda of Ailes' network. Yet last summer he left amid huge controversy, earning tens of millions of dollars in a payout after allegations of sexual harassment were launched against him by former employees. Ailes always denied the allegations against him. His death denies the rest of us the chance to hear his side of that particularly salacious story. Born in Warren, Ohio, his big break came in 1967 when Richard Nixon appeared as a guest on a talk show he was working on, persuading the future US president about the power of television. He played a role in Mr Nixon's successful campaign, as well as for other Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush Snr. Mr Ailes became the founding boss of Fox News in 1996, turning it into a profits and ratings powerhouse. It soon became a favourite of right-wing viewers, outpacing liberal-leaning rivals like CNN. The channel used the slogan ""fair and balanced"", but its critics saw it as anything but, accusing it of bias and of favouring the Republican Party. Such was his influence, his biographer Gabriel Sherman quoted him as saying ""I want to elect the next president"" to a group of Fox executives at a 2010 meeting. After leaving the company he reportedly helped Donald Trump prepare for the debates during his presidential campaign.",Friday 19 May 2017,19-May-17,Fox News founder Roger Ailes dies at 77,The ex-chairman of the right-wing channel was pushed out in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39963887
"Princess Mako to lose Japan royal status by marrying commoner A member of Japan's royal family, Princess Mako, is to surrender her royal status by marrying a commoner. The 25-year-old eldest granddaughter of Emperor Akihito will become engaged to law firm worker Kei Komuro, also 25, whom she met while studying together. Japan's imperial law requires a princess to leave the royal family after marrying a commoner. The move is expected to reignite debate on royal succession, with the emperor also possibly abdicating soon. Ten things about Japan's emperor Princess Mako and Kei Komuro met in 2012 at a restaurant, when they were both studying at the International Christian University in Tokyo.  The Imperial Household told local media that plans were under way for the princess's engagement. The engagement will only be official after a ceremonial exchange of gifts, local media said. Public broadcaster NHK said the wedding is expected to take place next year. Asked about their engagement plans, Mr Komuro on Wednesday was quoted as saying: ""Now is not the time for me to comment, but I want to speak at the right time."" Yes, Princess Mako's aunt Princess Sayako married a commoner in 2005 - the first time a Japanese royal became a commoner.  Her wedding to an urban planner for the Tokyo city government, was described as a low key event. And Sayako was left to adjust to her more humble surrounding.  She moved into a one-bedroom apartment, had to learn how to drive, shop in a supermarket and buy furniture. Princess Sayako is the only daughter of Emperor Akihito. Emperor Akihito, 83, hinted last August that he wanted to stand down, saying his age could interfere with his duties. No Japanese emperor has abdicated for two centuries and the law currently does not allow it, but Japan is currently considering legal changes to allow the emperor to abdicate. However, the new legislation is expected to leave unchanged a males-only succession law - which has been at the centre of debate for many years. Because of that law there are only four heirs to the Chrysanthemum Throne: Akihito's sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Fumihito, Prince Hisahito (Fumihito's son) and the emperor's younger brother, Prince Masahito.  After news of Princess Mako's upcoming engagement broke, Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: ""There is no change in our view to proceed with consideration of steps to ensure stable imperial succession.""

"Pyeongchang 2018: Athletes to travel through demilitarised zone   North Korean athletes will be allowed to travel through the demilitarised no-go zone into South Korea as a symbolic peace gesture before next year's Winter Olympic Games, organisers have promised. The 4km-wide zone has huge numbers of armed troops stationed on both sides and no movement of people is allowed between the two. But Pyeongchang 2018 organising committee chief Hee-Beom Lee said athletes from the North would be able to arrive by road. ""Symbolically, to maintain peace in the Korean peninsula, their participation is very important, and for the success of the Olympic Games,"" he added. The demilitarised zone (DMZ), established at the end of the Korean War in 1953, will mean support staff and fans will still have to travel from the North by ship. Last month, Olympic officials insisted rising tensions on the peninsula over the North's missile testing programme would not jeopardise the Games. South Korea's new president Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday there was a ""high possibility"" of military conflict with their neighbours. So far, no North Koreans have qualified for the Games, with figure skating offering the best opportunity. The final places will be decided at the 2017 Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany in September.  ""With or without qualification we are still talking with the International Olympic Committee and the relevant international federations for North Korea to participate,"" Lee told BBC Sport's Alex Capstick. He also spoke about Russia's participation at the Games - the International Paralympic Committee has banned Russian athletes following revelations of a state-sponsored doping programme, while Olympic chiefs have stopped short of an all-out ban. Lee said the country was doing a good job cleaning up its anti-doping system and does not believe the IOC will block them. ""I'm hopeful and I'm confident for the Russians to participate in Pyeongchang 2018,"" he said. He said he was also ""hopeful"" the NHL would allow its star ice hockey players to attend the Games.  The sport's leading league said last month it would not allow players to travel to Pyeongchang because club owners were unhappy at the prospect of halting the season for three weeks to make a window for the Games.

"US summons Turkey envoy for embassy brawl The US has summoned the Turkish ambassador after violence erupted between protesters and Turkish security personnel in Washington on Tuesday. Ambassador Serdar Kılıç met Under Secretary of State Tom Shannon on Wednesday, officials tell the BBC. Eleven people were injured outside the Turkish ambassador's residence during President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit.  Video footage of the clash on Tuesday showed men in suits charging past police to kick and punch protesters. Washington police called the violence a ""brutal attack on peaceful protesters"". But the Turkish embassy said the demonstrators had aggressively provoked Turkish-Americans  gathering to greet the president, and they in turn had responded in self-defence. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused senior US diplomat Brett McGurk of backing Kurdish militants and said he should be sent home. He said on Thursday that Mr McGurk, the US envoy to the coalition against so-called Islamic State (IS), was ""definitely"" supporting a Kurdish militant group, the Popular Protection Units (YPG), in Syria, as well as   a Kurdish separatist group in Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  Turkey sees the YPG as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, which has been fighting inside Turkey since the 1980s. Last week Mr Trump said he would arm the Syrian Kurds in the fight against IS.

"Pyeongchang 2018: Athletes to travel through demilitarised zone   North Korean athletes will be allowed to travel through the demilitarised no-go zone into South Korea as a symbolic peace gesture before next year's Winter Olympic Games, organisers have promised. The 4km-wide zone has huge numbers of armed troops stationed on both sides and no movement of people is allowed between the two. But Pyeongchang 2018 organising committee chief Hee-Beom Lee said athletes from the North would be able to arrive by road. ""Symbolically, to maintain peace in the Korean peninsula, their participation is very important, and for the success of the Olympic Games,"" he added. The demilitarised zone (DMZ), established at the end of the Korean War in 1953, will mean support staff and fans will still have to travel from the North by ship. Last month, Olympic officials insisted rising tensions on the peninsula over the North's missile testing programme would not jeopardise the Games. South Korea's new president Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday there was a ""high possibility"" of military conflict with their neighbours. So far, no North Koreans have qualified for the Games, with figure skating offering the best opportunity. The final places will be decided at the 2017 Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany in September.  ""With or without qualification we are still talking with the International Olympic Committee and the relevant international federations for North Korea to participate,"" Lee told BBC Sport's Alex Capstick. He also spoke about Russia's participation at the Games - the International Paralympic Committee has banned Russian athletes following revelations of a state-sponsored doping programme, while Olympic chiefs have stopped short of an all-out ban. Lee said the country was doing a good job cleaning up its anti-doping system and does not believe the IOC will block them. ""I'm hopeful and I'm confident for the Russians to participate in Pyeongchang 2018,"" he said. He said he was also ""hopeful"" the NHL would allow its star ice hockey players to attend the Games.  The sport's leading league said last month it would not allow players to travel to Pyeongchang because club owners were unhappy at the prospect of halting the season for three weeks to make a window for the Games. The 2018 Games will be held between 9 and 25 February, with the Winter Paralympics taking place from 9-18 March.

"US summons Turkey envoy for embassy brawl The US has summoned the Turkish ambassador after violence erupted between protesters and Turkish security personnel in Washington on Tuesday. Ambassador Serdar Kılıç met Under Secretary of State Tom Shannon on Wednesday, officials tell the BBC. Eleven people were injured outside the Turkish ambassador's residence during President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit.  Video footage of the clash on Tuesday showed men in suits charging past police to kick and punch protesters. Washington police called the violence a ""brutal attack on peaceful protesters"". But the Turkish embassy said the demonstrators had aggressively provoked Turkish-Americans  gathering to greet the president, and they in turn had responded in self-defence. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused senior US diplomat Brett McGurk of backing Kurdish militants and said he should be sent home.

"Conservative manifesto: Theresa May targets mainstream Britain' Prime Minister Theresa May has promised a ""mainstream government that will deliver for mainstream Britain"". Launching the Conservative manifesto, Mrs May said a strong economy and delivering Brexit were top priorities. The manifesto drops the 2015 pledge not to raise income tax or National Insurance and has big changes to social care funding in England. People worth more than £100,000 would have to pay for their care - but could defer payment until after their death. The calculation for people who need care at home will take into account the value of their property. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the Conservatives of proposing a ""tax on dementia"".  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the Conservatives hoped that the ""new mainstream"" message would help them scoop up votes in areas where the Conservatives have traditionally been considered toxic. Mrs May, speaking at the manifesto launch in Halifax, said: ""We must take this opportunity to build a great meritocracy in Britain. It means making Britain a country that works, not for the privileged few, but for everyone."" She said there were five priorities: a strong economy, facing up to the consequences of Brexit and a changing world, tackling ""enduring"" social divisions, responding to the challenges of an ageing society and harnessing the power of fast-changing technology. Manifesto measures include: On executive pay, the manifesto says packages should be approved by an annual vote of shareholders, and companies will have to publish details on how it compares to the pay of the workforce in general. There are also plans to ensure worker representation at board level. Mrs May was asked whether her plans spelled a move away from Conservative policies of recent years, and in particular those of Margaret Thatcher. She said: ""Margaret Thatcher was a Conservative, I am a Conservative, this is a Conservative manifesto."" She later added: ""There is no May-ism. There is good solid Conservatism, which puts the interests of the country and the interests of ordinary working people at the heart of everything we do in government."" The social care changes proposed are that the value of someone's property would be included in the means test for receiving free care in their own home - currently only their income and savings are taken into account. People will be able to defer paying for their care until after their death. Those in residential care - whose property is already taken into account in the means test - can already do this.  There will also be an increase in the amount of wealth someone can have - savings and the value of their home - from the current £23,250 to £100,000 - before they lose the right to free care. That means that however much is spent on social care, it becomes free once someone is down to their last £100,000.  Sir Andrew Dilnot produced a report on the social care system for the coalition government in 2011, which recommended that individuals' contributions to their care costs should be capped at £35,000. ""The disappointment about these proposals is that they fail to tackle the biggest problem of all in social care: there is nothing that you can do to protect yourself against care costs,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ""People will be left helpless, knowing that what will happen if they are unlucky enough to suffer the need for care costs, is that they will be entirely on their own until they are down to their last £100,000 of all of their wealth, including their house."" By Nick Triggle, BBC health correspondent What the Conservatives have proposed for elderly care is pretty complex. They are changing certain thresholds as well as what can be defined as assets and how long you wait before you have to pay your bill. But in the end it can be summed up quite easily - they want people to pay more towards the cost of their care, but are prepared to wait until you die before taking it from your estate. Some elements of their plans sound generous and certainly some people will benefit, but large numbers won't. Why? Because we are a nation of homeowners and these plans make sure that whatever sort of care you need, the value of your home can be taken into account. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt defended the manifesto proposal, telling BBC Breakfast: ""Everyone will have the security of knowing that they can pass on £100,000 to their children and grandchildren. At the moment, you can be cleaned out to as little as £23,000 so that's four times more."" ""We are saying to pay for that there's a trade-off,"" Mr Hunt added. In Scotland the SNP government has maintained a policy of free personal care. Mrs May's plan to stick with the net migration target has caused controversy, with critics saying it will be nearly impossible to meet without doing damage to the economy. Net migration, the difference between people coming to the UK for more than a year and those leaving, stood at 273,000 in the year to last September. It was last below 100,000 in 1997. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, accused the Conservatives of a ""blunt approach to immigration"" which risked hobbling UK firms trying to attract overseas talent. But Richard Tice, co-chair of Leave Means Leave, said: ""Committing to reducing net migration to the tens of thousands is the right thing to do and is simply the average migration levels achieved in the 1990s, when our public services and businesses worked well and low skilled wages were not suppressed as they are now.""  Mr Corbyn accused the prime minister of betraying pensioners. He said: ""She is hitting older people with a classic nasty party triple whammy:  Scrapping the triple lock on pensions, removing the Winter Fuel Allowance and forcing those who need social care to pay for it with their homes."" Sir Ed Davey, for the Liberal Democrats, said: ""It is clear the more you need, the more you pay with May. Theresa May is betraying working families by snatching school lunches from their children and their homes when they die.""  The SNP said Theresa May wanted a ""free hand to dismantle the welfare state and to push through their reckless plans for a hard Brexit which threaten jobs, investment and livelihoods"". The Green Party said the social care changes would hit those in need, and the drive to bring down immigration was ""economically illiterate"" and ""cruel"". Plaid Cymru said the manifesto was a ""wish list for the one per cent"" - the ""privileged few"".

"Syria war: IS attack in Hama on government forces More than 50 people are reported to have been killed in heavy fighting in Syria after so-called Islamic State launched an attack in Hama province. The militants targeted villages under government control, and clashed with the army and its militia allies.  The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said at least 15 of the dead were civilians.  The fighting is near a strategically important highway linking Hama city with the Aleppo area further north. The SOHR said at least 27 government troops or militia were killed in the attack, on the villages of Aqareb and al-Mabujeh. Another 10 bodies had yet to be identified. Some of the civilians killed were put to death after being captured by IS, the observatory added. State news agency Sana also reported the attack in Aqareb, saying 20 civilians were killed there, but made no mention of al-Mabujeh. Why is there a war in Syria? IS was now fully in control of Aqareb, SOHR said, adding that the government had sent reinforcements to the area.

"Texas man sues woman for texting in date A Texas man has filed a lawsuit against a woman for the cost of a movie ticket after she texted during their cinema date. Brandon Vezmar, 37, said the woman walked out of the screening of Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 when he complained about her persistent phone use.  Mr Vezmar filed the petition in the state capital of Austin last week seeking $17.31 (£13.30), arguing his date's behaviour was ""a threat to civilised society"". Crystal Cruz initially refused to reimburse him because ""he took me out on a date"". However, she relented after US TV programme Inside Edition reunited the pair at the same cinema. ""The date just didn't work out,"" she told him, adding: ""Just leave this alone."" ""Oh my God,"" Ms Cruz told the Austin American-Statesman earlier this week when she learned of the legal action. ""This is crazy."" Mr Vezmar said she began texting about 15 minutes after the movie began during their first date on 6 May. ""It was kind of a first date from hell,"" he told the newspaper.  He said he asked her to stop and when she refused, Mr Vezmar suggested she should step outside to text.  The woman left and did not return, he said.  Mr Vezmar said he texted her the next day to ask for the price of the ticket but she refused the initial request. Mr Vezmar dropped the suit on Thursday after Ms Cruz handed over the money, which he counted in front of her.  Ms Cruz said on Tuesday she only texted two or three times with her friend who was having a fight with her boyfriend.  ""I had my phone low and I wasn't bothering anybody,"" she said.  According to the lawsuit, the texting was a ""direct violation"" of the cinema's policy and she ""adversely"" affected his and other patrons' viewing experience.  ""While damages sought are modest, the principle is important as defendant's behaviour is a threat to civilized society,"" the petition said.",Friday 19 May 2017,19-May-17,Texas man sues woman for texting in date,"He says the woman's behaviour was ""a threat to civilised society""; she calls the lawsuit ""crazy"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39966675
"Trump: Firing 'nut job' FBI chief 'eased pressure' US President Donald Trump told Russian officials that firing FBI director James Comey eased ""great pressure"" on him, US media report. The New York Times, citing a document summarising last week's meeting, says he called Mr Comey a ""real nut job"". Mr Comey had been running an inquiry into possible collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's election campaign. The ex-FBI chief has agreed to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the investigation. The latest report was published just as Mr Trump took off on a flight to the Middle East for the first leg of his first foreign tour as president. ""I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,"" Mr. Trump said, according to the report. ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off."" The White House has not disputed the language used in the meeting at the Oval Office between Mr Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. In another development, the Washington Post reported that a current White House official is a ""significant person of interest"" in the investigation into alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. It quoted unnamed sources familiar with the investigation as saying it was someone ""close to the president"" but they would not identify them further. The White House has denied there was collusion between the campaign and any ""foreign entity"". Donald Trump called the ongoing Russia investigation a ""witch hunt"", but reporters have just found a boiling cauldron and a closet full of broomsticks. The key takeaway from these latest blockbuster stories - there have been so many this week it's hard to keep count - is there's now further evidence of Mr Trump's intent to dismiss FBI Director James Comey because of his handling of the ongoing Russia investigation.  That this revelation came as a result of a meeting with Russian officials, one of whom is a key figure in the investigation, is just the icing on the cake. What's more, it now appears this investigation has expanded to involve an individual who currently holds a senior post within the White House, not just an ex-aide (Michael Flynn) or campaign official (Paul Manafort). If that's the case, it's only a matter of time before subpoenas are issued and the entire administration adopts a bunker mentality. Donald Trump reportedly told his Russian guests that firing Mr Comey had relieved the ""great pressure"" his administration was under because of the Russia investigation.  That, it turns out, was wishful thinking in the extreme. Warning that leaks were undermining national security, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said: ""By grandstanding and politicising the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia. ""The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it."" The BBC's Gary O'Donoghue, in Washington, says the White House has chosen to interpret the president's words as relating to the national interest rather than to himself. The summary was drawn from a formal account of last week's meeting, which was attended by Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak - a man at the centre of many of the controversial contacts between the Trump campaign and senior Russian officials.  Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey the evening before, a move that sent shockwaves through Washington.  Critics accused the president of trying to thwart the FBI investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the US election and any Moscow ties to Trump associates. Mr Comey has agreed to give details of the investigation to the US Senate Intelligence Committee at a public hearing, as well as take questions surrounding his dismissal.  The date has not yet been scheduled, but is expected to take place next month.",Saturday 20 May 2017,20-May-17,Trump: Firing FBI chief 'eased pressure',"The US president reportedly called the former FBI chief James Comey a ""real nut job"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39983257
"Julian Assange defiant as Sweden drops rape investigation Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has said he will not forgive and forget attempts to arrest him over rape allegations which led him to seek asylum in Ecuador's London embassy. Hailing an ""important victory"", he said he was prepared for dialogue with the US and UK authorities. Mr Assange, 45, is wanted in the US over the leaking of military and diplomatic documents. Sweden said on Friday it had decided to drop its rape investigation. Meanwhile Ecuador urged the UK to allow him safe passage out of the country. The Wikileaks founder has chosen to remain in the embassy as he fears extradition to Sweden would lead to extradition to the US. ""Today is an important victory for me and the UN human rights system, but by no means erases seven years of detention without charge... while my children grew up. That is not something I can forgive or forget,"" he told journalists from a balcony at the embassy. Standing by the Ecuadorian flag, on the balcony which in recent years has become his podium for addressing the media, Julian Assange delivered a characteristic and vitriolic attack on Western Governments and the European Union.  He spoke slowly to the street below, full of microphones and cameras. There were no questions for the journalists.  In short, he will not be leaving the Ecuadorian embassy any time soon.  In his words: ""The war is just commencing"". That seemed to be a colourful characterisation of his battle with British justice, now that the arrest warrant from Sweden has gone away.  If the founder of Wikileaks were to walk out of the embassy then British police would still be compelled to arrest him.  That is because he failed to answer bail when he took up residence at the embassy nearly five years ago.  The offence of failing to surrender to bail carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. ""My legal staff have contacted the UK authorities and we hope to engage in a dialogue about what will be the best way forward,"" he added, saying he was also ""happy to engage"" with the US. Police in London have said they would still be obliged to arrest Mr Assange if he left the Ecuadorean embassy, despite the Swedish prosecutors' decision. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) said Mr Assange still faced the lesser charge of failing to surrender to a court, an offence punishable by up to a year in prison or a fine. But the UK has not commented on whether it has received an extradition request from the US, where Mr Assange could, potentially, face trial. The plaintiff in the rape case was ""shocked"" by the decision, her lawyer said, and maintained her accusations against Mr Assange, Agence France-Presse reported. Sweden's decision coincided with the release by Wikileaks of another tranche of documents about the US Central Intelligence Agency's technical capabilities. BBC security correspondent Gordon Correra says previous leaks, of what look like highly sensitive secret documents, have been damaging to the agency. Foreign Minister Guillaume Long said that the UK should now grant Mr Assange safe passage, as the European arrest warrant against him ""no longer holds"". ""Ecuador welcomes the decision to drop the charges,"" Mr Long added, quoted by AFP, while criticising the time it took Sweden to send an investigator to London to interview Mr Assange. ""Ecuador regrets that it took Swedish prosecutor more than four years to carry out this interview. This was a wholly unnecessary delay."" Earlier a source at the ministry told the Press Association that Ecuador had ""fully co-operated with the Swedish justice system"". The source added that Ecuador would now intensify its diplomatic efforts with the UK so that Julian Assange could ""enjoy his asylum in Ecuador"". At a press briefing on Friday, Sweden's top prosecutor Marianne Ny said that by remaining in the embassy in London Mr Assange had evaded the exercise of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) that would have seen him extradited to Sweden. She said that under Swedish law a criminal investigation needed to be conducted ""as quickly as possible"". Sweden did not expect Ecuador's co-operation in formally notifying Mr Assange of the allegations against him, a necessary step in proceeding with the case, she added. But she said: ""If he were to return to Sweden before the statute of limitation on this case expires in August 2020, the preliminary investigation could be resumed."" She said it was ""regrettable we have not been able to carry out the investigation"", and added: ""We are not making any pronouncement about guilt."" The rape allegation followed a Wikileaks conference in Stockholm in 2010. Mr Assange always denied the allegations against him, saying sex was consensual. He also said the case was politically motivated, as it followed massive Wikileaks dumps of secret US military reports that year. Later that year he was arrested in London after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant against him. He spent the following months under house arrest in a small rural town in England. Then, in June 2012, after exhausting legal avenues to prevent his extradition, Mr Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy, where he remains to this day. After the news was announced on Friday, Wikileaks tweeted that the ""focus now moves to the UK"", but Mr Assange's fate still seems unclear. The MPS issued a statement saying that its actions had been based on a response to a ""European Arrest Warrant for an extremely serious offence"". It went on: ""Now that the situation has changed and the Swedish authorities have discontinued their investigation into that matter, Mr Assange remains wanted for a much less serious offence. The MPS will provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offence."" The MPS said it would ""not comment further on the operational plan"". Last month, Mr Samuelson filed a new motion calling for his client's arrest warrant to be lifted. He cited a comment by new US Attorney General Jeff Sessions that the arrest of Mr Assange would be ""a priority"". Mr Samuelson told Agence France-Presse: ""This implies that we can now demonstrate that the US has a will to take action... this is why we ask for the arrest warrant to be cancelled.""",Saturday 20 May 2017,20-May-17,Assange defiant as rape probe dropped,The Wikileaks founder says he wants to talk to the US and UK authorities about his future.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39979343
"Michel Temer: Brazil president faces new corruption accusations Brazilian President Michel Temer has taken millions of dollars in bribes since 2010, according to testimony released by the Supreme Court. The plea-bargain testimony came from bosses of a giant meat-packing firm. If confirmed, the accusations could prove devastating for Mr Temer's crisis-hit administration, though he has vowed to prove his innocence. He is already facing allegations he authorised paying bribes to silence a witness in a huge corruption scandal. On Thursday he vowed in a TV address to stay on as president. Joesley Batista, the chairman of the company JBS, alleges that Mr Temer was paid more than $2.5m (9m reais) over the last seven years for electoral campaigning and to pay allies.  Another company director says $4.6m was distributed to Mr Temer's allies in 2014 in the guise of official election campaign donations. Former Presidents Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff received $50m and $30m respectively to fund political campaigns, the testimony says. Both have denied any accusations against them. Separately, Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot wrote in a court filing on Friday that Mr Temer was one of a number of politicians who obstructed investigations into the massive corruption inquiry known as Operation Car Wash. A year ago, Mr Temer took office after Ms Rousseff's impeachment. Now there are calls for his removal too.  On Thursday Brazilian authorities released an audio recording where Mr Temer appears to be discussing bribes in conversation with Mr Batista.  Mr Temer has said the footage is authentic, taken from a meeting in March, but he has strongly denied wrongdoing. Mr Temer is already deeply unpopular in Brazil but his centre-right party has been able to govern as part of a coalition. Opposition parties have been demanding snap elections and his impeachment. It is the first time Mr Temer has become fully embroiled in Operation Car Wash. The probe, launched in March 2014, centres on companies that were offered deals with state oil giant Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and political party slush funds. The scandal has engulfed Brazilian politics, with a third of Mr Temer's cabinet under investigation for alleged corruption. Former president Lula is already facing five charges. The man Mr Temer allegedly condoned the bribery of - Eduardo Cunha -  is in prison for corruption, money laundering and tax evasion. Both men played a key role in the downfall of Ms Rousseff, who was removed from office accused of illegally manipulating government accounts.

"Harry Potter fans warned after near misses on Glenfinnan Viaduct Harry Potter fans are risking death by wandering on to a railway line to take photographs of a viaduct used for scenes in the fantasy adventure films. British Transport Police said incidents at the Glenfinnan Viaduct played a part in a 16% rise in railway trespassing offences in Scotland last year. BTP has issued a fresh warning for people to stay away from the area of the West Highland Line. In 2015, a family was among tourists who put themselves in danger. The couple and their child were seen running on the railway line. Tourists and photographers are also drawn to the viaduct because of its Highlands setting and due to a steam train, the Jacobite, that regularly runs on the line. The train also featured in the film franchise. Five years ago, a steam train driver was forced to brake after spotting two older women standing dangerously close to the line. The driver also reported narrowly missing a man who had been standing on the railway with a camera tripod in the same incident. In its new warning, BTP said it understood the fascination with the viaduct because of Harry Potter, but ""people do not have any magical powers so there is nothing to protect them from being injured or killed by a passing train"". Inverness Station-based Sgt Kevin Lawrence said: ""Tourists from all over the world travel on the Jacobite steam train during the summer months to visit the famous Glenfinnan Viaduct. ""Alarmingly, visitors often get off the train at Glenfinnan and walk back along the line to take photographs. This is extremely dangerous.  ""The scenic, rural area also attracts many bikers and other tourists also travelling by road to see the viaduct."" BTP said Network Rail had improved fencing in the area as well as signs directing people to safe vantage points. Sgt Lawrence added: ""Much as we love Harry Potter, I would like to remind everyone that we are mere Muggles, and if you trespass on the railway and are struck by a train, the consequences could be extremely serious and probably fatal.""

"'Clock boy' discrimination case thrown out by Texas judge A US judge has thrown out a discrimination case brought by the family of a Muslim student whose homemade clock was mistaken for a bomb.  In 2015 Ahmed Mohamed was arrested in a suburb of Dallas, Texas, after his teacher said the clock looked like an explosive device. Photos of the 14-year-old's arrest sparked a public outcry. But on Thursday a Texas judge ruled there was no evidence of racial or religious discrimination. ""Plaintiff does not allege any facts from which this court can reasonably infer"" that Irving Independent School District employees ""intentionally discriminated"" against Ahmed Mohamed, wrote US District Judge Sam Lindsay in his ruling. He also dismissed a complaint against the school principal saying it was ""factually deficient"" to allege that Ahmed was treated ""differently than other similarly situated students, and that the unequal treatment was based on religion or race"". Ahmed, whom US media dubbed ""clock boy"", was originally charged with having a ""hoax bomb"" after he brought the digital clock display in a small briefcase to the classroom at MacArthur High School in Irving.  But those charges were later dropped. The family's lawyer, Susan Hutchison, said when their lawsuit was first filed: ""They knew it wasn't a bomb, that he never threatened anyone, that he never said it was a bomb, that he never alarmed anyone. ""Despite all of those things, they yanked him out of his chair, put him in handcuffs and arrested him. There was no cause for arrest."" #IStandWithAhmed trended on Twitter after the arrest and the teenager was invited to an astronomy event at the White House where he spoke to then-President Barack Obama. Shortly after the incident, the boy's family moved to Qatar, before moving back to Texas a few months later.

"New Orleans purges final Confederate statue Masked city workers in New Orleans have removed the last of four monuments to the pro-slavery rebellion defeated in the US Civil War. The 133-year-old statue depicted General Robert E Lee, the top military leader in the Confederacy, crossing his arms as he faced north towards his old enemy. Critics say monuments to the Confederacy are racially offensive, but supporters say they are important symbols of the city's Southern heritage. The three other statues were all removed at night to limit clashes. The workers on the job were wearing bullet-proof vests as well as masks. In a statement on Thursday, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said the condemned statues ""were erected decades after the Civil War to celebrate the 'Cult of the Lost Cause', a movement recognised across the South as celebrating and promoting white supremacy."" Barricades went up overnight around the park where the 16ft (4.8m) statue was perched atop a 60ft column. The cables for a nearby streetcar were also temporarily taken down to allow construction equipment into the park.  Before police cleared the area on Thursday, nearly 200 protesters gathered to voice support and opposition to the monument. Demonstrations were mostly peaceful, local media report. The only flashpoint was when a pro-removal protester snatched a Confederate battle flag. One man was arrested for climbing on to the monument's pedestal and refusing to come down. The monument to Lee was erected on 22 February 1884 - nearly 20 years after the Civil War ended. On the day of the unveiling, a crowd of nearly 15,000 people came to watch, the Daily Picayune newspaper reported the next day. At the exact moment that the statue was unveiled, a 100-gun salute was fired, and ""a mighty shout went up from the soldiers of the Confederacy"", the Daily Picayune reported. City officials say the monuments will be moved somewhere such as a museum where they can be ""placed in their proper historical context from a dark period of American history"". But WWL-TV has found the removed monuments to Confederate President Jefferson Davis and PGT Beauregard in a city-owned scrap yard. Supporters of the monuments say they are a cultural legacy that promotes heritage rather than racism. The decision to remove the statues came in December 2015, six months after a white supremacist shot dead nine black worshippers at a South Carolina church.",Saturday 20 May 2017,20-May-17,US city purges final Confederate statue,The 133-year-old monument to General Lee is being removed by masked city workers.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39978141
"'Major breakthrough' in Norway's 46-year-old Isdal woman mystery Scientists believe they may have made a major breakthrough in efforts to solve a decades-long mystery of a burned body found in Norway 1970. New forensic analysis on the teeth of the unidentified ""Isdal woman"" found chemical traces which may tell investigators where she grew up. The results narrow the search to an area along the French-German border. The case received fresh impetus after journalists from Norway's national broadcaster NRK began an inquiry. The NRK team, which has been researching the case for over a year, hailed the new information as a ""major breakthrough"". And a scientist at the Norwegian Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos) said the results were ""much more specific than I could have dreamed of"". The unusual circumstances surrounding the case, and speculation over her mysterious past, have made it an enduring popular mystery for 46 years. Someone had cut the labels off her clothes, and scraped distinctive marks off her belongings - as if to stop her from being identified. And as police started investigating her death, they uncovered a trail of coded messages, disguises, and fake identities - but never cracked the case. Forty-six years later, Norwegian police and NRK journalists have decided to reopen the investigation. This is the story of the Isdal Woman - and the perplexing trail of clues she left behind. NRK's investigation discovered the Isdal woman's jaw had been preserved in a forensic archive - opening up the chance that modern scientific methods could reveal more about her origins. Investigators at Kripos and University of Bergen started an isotope analysis on her teeth - looking at the chemical ""signature"" left as her teeth were being formed. It is the first time Norwegian police have used the technique - but the findings have been so specific they may now make it much easier to find people who knew the woman. ""It's actually quite a narrowed-down area that she most probably originated from,"" associate professor Jurian Hoogewerff at the University of Canberra in Australia - an expert in the technique - told NRK (in Norwegian). Past analysis of her DNA and handwriting has already suggested the Isdal woman may have come from Europe - possibly France. ""When I superimpose the maps, we can exclude several areas. The red sections show the highest probability of her whereabouts during the time when her teeth where formed,"" he said. ""This is much more specific than I could have dreamed of. I'm impressed that it's possible to get results like these and actually make these probability maps,"" a chemist at Kripos, Knut-Endre Sjåstad, said. The head of the forensic identification team, Per Angel, told NRK: ""This is a good reason to go into these specific areas with more focus. ""We should approach our European colleagues with this new specific information."" Because the isotope analysis tracks compounds absorbed at specific stages of tooth development, the researchers now think the Isdal woman moved from eastern or central Europe further west between childhood and adolescence. And while the age of the woman at the time her death was unknown, some of the indicators in the teeth suggest she may have moved just before or during World War II, NRK reports. NRK's investigative reporters have been working on the mystery for over a year. ""I am starting to believe that we might actually find her real identity,"" team member Marit Higraff said. ""Now the area that we have to comb is much smaller than even we had hoped for. Maybe this 46-year-old mystery can come to an end.""",Saturday 20 May 2017,20-May-17,'Major breakthrough' in Norway mystery,Analysis of mystery woman's teeth may finally tell Norwegian investigators where she came from.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39978131

"Ex-congressman Anthony Weiner pleads guilty to sexting Former New York congressman Anthony Weiner has tearfully pleaded guilty to sending obscene material to a minor.  He must register as a sex offender and faces a possible prison term for exchanging explicit texts with a 15-year-old girl last year.  The 52-year-old's estranged wife, Huma Abedin, filed for divorce on Friday after seven years of marriage. Weiner quit Congress in 2011 over a sex scandal and was again exposed in his 2013 run for New York mayor. He was reportedly wearing his wedding band as he entered his plea on Friday morning at a Manhattan court. Weiner was released on bail, pending sentencing on 8 September. As part of his plea agreement, federal prosecutors said they would consider a term between 21-27 months ""fair and appropriate"". Weiner cried in court as he said: ""I have a sickness, but I don't have an excuse.""  He acknowledged it was ""morally wrong"" and unlawful to have knowingly sent obscene messages between January and March last year to a North Carolina girl whom he knew to be 15 years old. Weiner paused to compose himself as he read from a letter he prepared for his plea. ""Beginning with my service in Congress and continuing into the first half of last year,"" his statement said, ""I have compulsively sought attention from women who contacted me on social media. ""These destructive impulses brought great devastation to my family and friends, and destroyed my life's dream of public service. ""And yet I remained in denial as the world around me fell apart.""

The former congressman's sexting scandal made headlines during last year's US presidential election, and featured in the 2016 documentary Weiner. During an investigation, FBI officials found emails on Weiner's laptop from his ex-wife, Ms Abedin, who was a top aide to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  An FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's private use of email while she was secretary of state was closed after officials said nothing incriminating was found.

"Italy makes 12 vaccinations compulsory for children The government in Italy has ruled that children must be vaccinated against 12 common illnesses before they can enrol for state-run schools. Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni blamed a decrease in vaccinations in part on a ""spread of anti-scientific theories"". Italy has recorded nearly three times as many measles cases so far this year than for all of 2016. If children are not vaccinated by the age of six, the school starting age, their parents will be fined. Conspiracy theories about the health risks of certain vaccinations - largely based on one discredited paper - have circulated around the world, leading some parents to shun immunisation. In Italy, the number of two-year-olds vaccinated against measles has dropped from more than 90% to below 80%. This is well short of the World Health Organization's recommended coverage of 95% or more. Measles is highly contagious and can lead to death. ""The lack of appropriate measures over the years and the spread of anti-scientific theories, especially in recent months, has brought about a reduction in protection,"" Mr Gentiloni told a press conference on Friday. The twelve conditions children must be immunised against are: ""We are sending a very strong message to the public,"" said Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin. In recent years a loose group of campaigners against vaccinations, dubbed the 'anti-vax' movement, has dissuaded people from opting in to immunisations by citing supposed risks. A long-discredited paper by Andrew Wakefield was behind much of the scare but the rumours around immunisation have continued to spread, leading to public health risks as not enough people are immune to such diseases. Mr Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register after fraudulently claiming there was a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism and bowel disease in children. He made the claim based on the experiences of just 12 children, and no other study since has been able to replicate his results.",Saturday 20 May 2017,20-May-17,Italy makes child vaccinations compulsory,The measure has been taken to combat a huge rise in measles cases as parents shun immunisation.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39983799
"Trump arrives in Saudi Arabia on first foreign tour US President Donald Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip since becoming president. His eight-day trip will also take in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Brussels, the Vatican, and Sicily. It comes as Mr Trump faces uproar at home following his sacking of FBI director James Comey. He has strongly criticised the decision to appoint a special counsel to oversee an inquiry into alleged Russian influence on the US election. The trip takes in the capitals of the three major monotheistic religions - Islam, Judaism and Christianity. Hours before Mr Trump's arrival, Saudi air defence units said they had brought down a rocket south of the capital, Riyadh, that was fired from Yemen by Houthi rebels.  Saudi warplanes are reported to have carried out retaliatory strikes on targets close to the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. President Trump's Saudi royal hosts have pulled out all the stops for this visit. They are lavishing him with an extravagant welcome not shown to his predecessor, Barack Obama, whom they felt was soft on their rival, Iran.  Many Saudis are immensely proud that, despite his mounting troubles at home, the US president has chosen their country as the first stop on his inaugural overseas tour. But pressed further, a lot of ordinary Saudis will voice their dislike of US policies in the region and their conviction that the US, and by extension the West, is intrinsically anti-Islamic.  On Sunday President Trump will try to address these concerns in a speech to more than 40 leaders of Muslim nations in which he will call for a united stand against extremism and intolerance.  Some have already commentated that Donald Trump is an unusual choice to deliver such a message but for now, Saudi officials are giving him the benefit of the doubt. Mr Trump will attend the Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh and speak about his ""hopes of a peaceful vision of Islam"", in what aides say will be a speech the president hopes will resonate worldwide and express ""a common vision of peace, progress and prosperity"". Mr Trump caused controversy during his campaign by calling for Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the US over security concerns. Legislation aimed at restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries remains tied up in the US courts. The summit agenda is expected to focus on combating Islamist militants and the growing regional influence of Iran. Mr Trump has been a fierce critic of the Iran deal which eased sanctions in return for a curb on its nuclear activities. One leader who will not be attending the summit will be Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir. President Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges and the US was reported to be unhappy about his planned attendance.   Unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, Mr Trump is not expected to highlight human rights during his trip. And aside from the formal diplomacy, US country music star Toby Keith will perform a free concert in Riyadh on Saturday alongside Saudi singer Rabeh Sager. Saudi Arabia, which enforces a strict interpretation of Islam including a total ban on alcohol, is perhaps an unusual venue for Keith - whose hits include I Love This Bar, Whiskey Girl, and Drunk Americans.  Saturday's concert is open only to men aged over 21, who are required to dress in traditional Saudi tunics. On Monday, Mr Trump will fly to Tel Aviv and travel on to Jerusalem where he will meet President Reuven Rivlin. He is due to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as well as the Western Wall before holding talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Observers will be watching to see if Mr Trump refers to his announcement during the election campaign, that he would break with decades of US policy and move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive and complex issues within the Middle East conflict and no country in the world currently has its embassy there. On Tuesday, Mr Trump will travel to Bethlehem in the West Bank for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Peace talks with Israel will top the agenda and Mr Trump is expected to express his support for Palestinian ""self-determination"". President Trump will arrive early in Rome and have an audience with Pope Francis. The two men have appeared at odds on many subjects including climate change and the plight of refugees, but the Pope has said he will give the president an open-minded hearing. Later, Mr Trump flies to Brussels where he will be greeted by King Philippe of Belgium and Prime Minister Charles Michel. After talks with EU leaders and France's new President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Trump will attend a meeting of Nato leaders.  This will be closely watched after Mr Trump's conflicting pronouncements on the alliance. During his campaign, he called Nato ""obsolete"", although in April he reversed his stance. The US leader is expected to repeat his demand that other Nato members increase their contributions. The last stop on Mr Trump's tour will be the picturesque Sicilian town of Taormina where he will attend a G7 summit. Correspondents say the other G7 leaders are eager to hear Mr Trump's thoughts on trade and other issues at first hand.  Mr Trump's national security adviser has said that the president will ""press America's economic agenda and call for greater security co-operation"".

"Chechen gay men hopeful of finding refuge in five countries Dozens of gay men who fled persecution in Chechnya are hoping to find safety in a handful of countries that have volunteered to help. Activists are in talks with five countries, two of them non-EU, the Russian LGBT Network told the BBC. Nine men have already been granted visas. Two of them went to Lithuania, which has announced its involvement. ""It's very important to act, because they are suffering,"" Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told the BBC. He would not name the other countries involved but described them as ""allies"". His country's decision was an ""implicit message"" to Russia, he said, because ""we are taking care of Russian citizens... [whose] rights were abused"". Reports of a brutal crackdown on gay men in the republic in southern Russia first emerged in early April through the respected Novaya Gazeta newspaper, sparking international condemnation.  Its report, later backed up by activists, alleged that more than 100 victims - either gay or just perceived as being gay - were being held and tortured at a detention centre near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. At least three deaths were reported.  The government of the mainly Muslim region has denied the crackdown and said homosexual people ""simply don't exist"" there. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will ask authorities to look into the allegations. The Russian LGBT Network has helped to evacuate 43 people from Chechnya, with dozens remaining in hiding in Russia as negotiations continue with the countries that might take them in. The organisation would not reveal the other countries involved apart from Lithuania. There have been calls in countries as far away as Australia for the men to be offered refuge. A Russian LGBT Network spokesperson said the UK, despite condemning the persecution, had not come forward to help with visas, while US embassy officials had privately said that visa applications would probably be denied.  ""We can't really lose time knowing that they are going to be denied,"" the spokesperson, who remained anonymous out of safety concerns, told the BBC. ""They can't stay in Russia for too long, we know it's not safe for them to stay here."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the issue on a recent visit to Russia but it is unclear if Germany is one of the countries involved. The UK Foreign Office told the BBC that officials in Moscow were lobbying the Russian government to protect the LGBT community in Chechnya. Claims for asylum need to be made in Britain, the Home Office said. ""No one who is found to be at risk of persecution or serious harm in their country of origin because of their sexuality or gender identity will be returned there,"" it said. The US State Department has said that Chechens can apply for visas but told Buzzfeed News that there was no visa category specifically for ""humanitarian relief"". The men would have to leave Russia to apply for refugee status in the US. Chechnya is run by Ramzan Kadyrov, an authoritarian leader with a notorious private militia, fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this month, three French gay rights groups filed a complaint at the International Criminal Court accusing Chechnya of a policy of genocide towards gay people. They cited the case of a teenaged male thrown out of a ninth-storey window, allegedly because of his sexuality.",Saturday 20 May 2017,20-May-17,Chechen gay men finding refuge abroad,Activists are in talks with five countries to secure visas for gay men who have fled Chechnya.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39974512
"China crippled CIA by killing US sources, says New York Times Up to 20 CIA informants were killed or imprisoned by the Chinese government between 2010 and 2012, the New York Times reports, damaging US information-gathering in the country for years. It is not clear whether the CIA was hacked or whether a mole helped the Chinese to identify the agents, officials told the paper. They said one of the informants was shot in the courtyard of a government building as a warning to others. The CIA did not comment on the report. Four former CIA officials spoke to the paper, telling it that information from sources deep inside the Chinese government bureaucracy started to dry up in 2010. Informants began to disappear in early 2011. The CIA and FBI teamed up to investigate the events in an operation one source said was codenamed Honey Badger. The paper said this investigation had centred on one former CIA operative but there was not enough evidence to arrest him. He now lives in another Asian country. In 2012, an official at China's security ministry was arrested on suspicion of spying for the US. He was said to have been lured into the CIA. No other such arrests appear to have reached public attention during that time. Matt Apuzzo, a New York Times journalist who worked on the story, told the BBC: ""One of the really troubling things about this is that we still don't know what happened.  ""There's a divide within the American government over whether there was a mole inside the CIA or whether this was a tradecraft problem, that the CIA agents got sloppy and got discovered, or whether the Chinese managed to hack communications."" A few years later in 2015, the CIA pulled staff out of the US embassy in Beijing, after a hack blamed on the Chinese state exposed information about millions of US federal employees. If the events of 2010-2012 were helped by a similar hack, it was not one that was made public. The disappearance of so many spies damaged a network it had taken years to build up, the New York Times reports, and hampered operations for years afterwards,  even prompting questions from within the Obama administration as to why intelligence had slowed. Officials said it was one of the worst security breaches of recent years. By 2013, the Chinese government seemed to have lost its ability to identify US agents and the CIA moved back to trying to rebuild its network. Mr Apuzzo continued: ""For many years China and the US have been locked in this spy battle that's been going on behind the scenes. While doing this story we uncovered that Chinese intelligence have been able to infiltrate an NSA outpost in Taiwan. It goes back and forth."" The story was published during a temporary vacuum at the top of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The Trump administration has named Terry Branstad, who is the governor of Iowa, as its ambassador to China but he has not yet moved to Beijing.

"Trump in Saudi Arabia: First foreign trip starts as home troubles mount The US says it has signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn) with Saudi Arabia as Donald Trump begins his first foreign trip as president. The agreements included an $110bn arms deal, which the White House described as the single biggest in US history. Mr Trump and his wife Melania were greeted in the Saudi capital by King Salman on Saturday morning local time. The eight-day trip comes as Mr Trump faces uproar at home following his sacking of FBI director James Comey. It will also take in Israel, the Palestinian city of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, Brussels, the Vatican, and Sicily. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the arms deal was aimed at countering the ""malign"" influence of Iran. ""The package of defence equipment and services supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the entire Gulf region,"" he told a news conference in Riyadh.  Mr Trump is accompanied on his visit by his daughter Ivanka, an unpaid White House adviser, and her husband Jared Kushner, a key member of the Trump administration. Like British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on their recent visits to Saudi Arabia, Mrs Trump and Ivanka Trump did not wear headscarves. In January 2015, Mr Trump criticised then-First Lady Michelle Obama for doing the same. In a tweet, Mr Trump said she had ""insulted"" her hosts.

In a tweet, King Salman praised Mr Trump, adding that he hoped his visit would ""strengthen our strategic co-operation"". He later handed the US President Saudi Arabia's highest civilian honour, the King Abdulaziz medal. It's being called a summit like no other and in some ways, that's true. Saudis note that past presidential visits were organised by the Royal Court. This time Riyadh is bursting with summits and forums, drawing in all levels of government and everyone from wealthy CEOs, to experts on extremism, to young savvy social media experts.  But behind the hype, there's nervousness too. ""We don't talk about an elephant in the room, we call it the elephant in Riyadh,"" a young Saudi tells me, highlighting the famous unpredictability of the US president when he veers from the official script.  This visit is tightly choreographed to minimise that risk.  And it's not that officials in Riyadh are unaware of the crises roiling Washington. ""The Saudis still see him as a president who can and will deliver when it comes to their interests,"" says one adviser. That's what matters for now. But whether Washington will fully follow the Saudi script for the region still has to be seen.  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Saudi Arabia had signed a deal to buy just under $110bn (£84bn) of American-made arms, which he said was the biggest such deal in US history. Reuters news agency reports the deal includes the assembly of 150 Blackhawk helicopters in Saudi Arabia, worth about $6bn alone. AFP quoted a White House official as saying the deal will bolster the kingdom's ""ability to contribute to counter-terrorism operations across the region, reducing the burden on the US military to conduct those operations"". Saudi Arabia has been fighting Houthi rebels in neighbouring Yemen since March 2015. The United Nations says about 10,000 people have been killed since the fighting began, with Yemen on the verge of famine. Rex Tillerson said the arms deal and other investments would add up to more than $350bn.  US giant General Electric said it had signed agreements worth $15 billion, and Saudi oil giant Aramco, had been expected to sign $50bn (£38bn) of deals with 11 US companies.

"South African men march against abuse of women and children Hundreds of protesters, most of them men, have marched in the South African capital, Pretoria, over rising levels of violence against women and children. One of the organisers, Kholofelo Masha, said men had to take collective responsibility for the increase in beatings, sex attacks and killings.  South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world. Police figures showed that 64,000 cases were reported last year. A series of grisly murders of women and children has hit the headlines this year and President Jacob Zuma has described the situation as a crisis.  Will I be next? South Africa women ask The protesters on Saturday marched behind a woman symbolically dressed from head to toe in white. Some carried placards bearing the names of women killed by their partners. ""The time to take collective responsibility for our shameful action is now,"" said Mr Masha, who described himself as ""a loving dad, brother and uncle."" He said South African men had been quiet on the issue for too long. ""You hear a lady screaming next door, you decide to sleep when you know there is a problem. No man should beat a woman or rape a woman while you're watching"". On Thursday, President Zuma visited the parents of a three-year-old girl who was raped and killed. Courtney Pieters went missing from her home in Cape Town on 4 May and her body was found more than a week later in a shallow grave. ""We, as the citizens of this country, must say enough is enough,"" Mr Zuma said at the time. ""This is one of the saddest incidents I've come across.  It's a crisis in the country, the manner in which women and children are being killed.""

"Norway to boost protection of Arctic seed vault from climate change Norway is boosting the flood defences of its Global Seed Vault on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard after water entered the entrance tunnel last year. The storage facility, deep inside a mountain, is designed to preserve the world's crops from future disasters. Unseasonably high temperatures last year caused the permafrost to melt, sending water into the access tunnel. No seeds were damaged but the facility is to have new waterproof walls in the tunnel and drainage ditches outside. The vault stores seeds from 5,000 crop species from around the world. Dried and frozen, it is believed they can be preserved for hundreds of years. Although most countries keep their own supplies of key varieties, the Global Seed Vault acts as a back-up. If a nation's seeds are lost as a result of a natural disaster or a man-made catastrophe, the specimens stored in the Arctic could be used to regenerate them. Scientists at the facility describe the vault as the most important room in the world. Government spokeswoman Hege Njaa Aschim told the BBC that the reason the vault was built on Svalbard was because the permafrost was thought to be permanent. She said the problems emerged last October when the temperatures, instead of being -10C or colder, were hovering around 0C. ""It was like a wet summer in Norway,"" she told the BBC. ""Inside the mountain it's safe but the problems we have experienced are just outside and in the front of the tunnel, which is the entrance. So Yes, maybe something has changed in the permafrost, but we don't know, and that is what the climate researchers are looking into. We have to follow them carefully."" The new measures announced include drainage ditches on the mountainside to stop water from accumulating around the access tunnel. Waterproof walls inside the tunnel itself will provide extra protection for the vaults. In addition, Statsbygg, the agency that administers the vault, is to carry out a research and development project to monitor the permafrost on Svalbard.",Sunday 21 May 2017,21-May-17,Norway takes steps to protect seed vault,"Water got into a frozen facility guarding the world's key crop seeds, raising fears of damage.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39987495
"Chibok girls: 82 reunited with families in Nigeria A group of the ""Chibok girls"" freed from Nigeria's Boko Haram militants have been reunited with their families. The 82 girls, who were part of a huge group kidnapped from their school in 2014, are in the care of security services in the capital, Abuja. Their parents travelled by bus through the night to meet their daughters. More than 100 of the 276 girls, taken from the town of Chibok, are still being held by the militant group. Their whereabouts are unknown. The reunion in Abuja had a celebratory atmosphere, with music and dance. The BBC's Alistair Leithead says the girls were already dancing when their parents got off the bus and raced towards them, in an emotional reunion. The 82 young women were only freed two weeks earlier in exchange for five Boko Haram militants. The most recent group freed was supposed to have 83 girls - but one refused to leave, saying she was happy and had found a husband, a Nigerian government spokesman said. The freed girls remain in government care - under the eye of security services who are questioning them about their time spent as captives. After the girls were abducted from their school in April 2014, a massive global awareness campaign began, using the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. The Chibok girls represent a fraction of the women captured by the militant group, estimates for which number in the thousands.",Sunday 21 May 2017,21-May-17,Chibok girls reunited with families,"The girls, kidnapped in 2014, were released two weeks ago and have finally met their parents.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39987271
"NBA star Enes Kanter's passport cancelled by native Turkey An NBA basketball player from Turkey, Enes Kanter, has been stopped at a Romanian airport, after Turkey cancelled his passport. Kanter, an Oklahoma City Thunder star, posted a video on Twitter saying this was due to his political views. He blamed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who he called ""a bad, bad man"", and a  ""dictator"". Kanter, who turned 25 on Saturday, was later allowed to fly to London. It is unclear what documents he was using.  ""They've been holding us here for hours,"" Kanter said in his video. ""The reason behind it is, of course, my political views."" He posted a similar message in Turkish. Romanian border police confirmed facts related to Mr Kanter's story, but did not speculate over the reasons. In a statement - accompanied on social media by a photo of the sports star with police - border officials said he was detained at around 13:00 (12:00 GMT) after arriving on a plane from Frankfurt. His passport was not valid, having been cancelled by ""the issuing state"", it said, and they could not allow him to enter Romania. But he was not under arrest. He left at around 17:00 on a flight bound for London, it said.  When mentioning President Erdogan, Kanter told his audience: ""You guys know him by, you know, he has attacked the people in Washington."" He was referring to a controversial clash between protesters and men apparently linked to Mr Erdogan's security detail during the Turkish leader's recent trip to the US. Kanter is a supporter of Fethullah Gulen, the US-based cleric blamed by the Turkish president for inciting a failed coup in 2016.  Turkey has demanded the preacher, who runs a network of schools in Turkey, be extradited, but the US has said it will only do on the basis of evidence. In August 2016, Kanter cut ties with his family after his father publicly disowned him in the Turkish press. Since the failed coup, suspected Gulenist supporters have been purged from jobs in Turkey. Many have been arrested.",Sunday 21 May 2017,21-May-17,Turkish NBA star held in Romania,"Enes Kanter, a critic of the Turkish president, was held after Turkey cancelled his passport.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39987275
"Pippa Middleton wedding: Royals and celebrities at ceremony Guests including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have attended the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews.  Miss Middleton, 33, who is the younger sister of the duchess, married 41-year-old Mr Matthews at St Mark's Church in Englefield, Berkshire. The bride was accompanied by her father, Michael, as they arrived shortly after 11:15 BST for the 45-minute ceremony. The church is a few miles from the Middleton family home in Bucklebury. There was strict security in place on the estate, with villagers being asked to carry ID on the day, and asked not to speak to the press. But the bride received a rousing cheer from around 100 royal fans and residents as she arrived. Prince Harry, Princess Eugenie, and Roger Federer and his wife Mirka were among the guests at the church.  The heavy downpour that started minutes after the beginning of the service ended a few moments before the church doors opened. Wedding bells rang out just before 12.30 BST as the new husband and wife walked hand in hand along the church path. Guests filed out and walked to nearby Englefield House, where it is believed a champagne reception is being held. Miss Middleton wore a bespoke Giles Deacon dress, said to be crafted to create the impression of being seamless. The dress was teamed with a Stephen Jones veil, a Maidenhair Fern tiara, and Manolo Blahnik ivory satin shoes. David Emanuel, who designed Princess Diana's wedding dress and hosts Say Yes to the Dress UK, called the gown ""simple and pretty"".  ""I predicted it would be soft and pretty and very English, which it is,"" he said. The bride's nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, were page boy and flower girl. Actress Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's girlfriend, is also reportedly in the UK but was not seen among the guests at the church. Pippa Middleton was driven to St Mark's Church alongside her father in a 1951 Jaguar. They shared a few words and then walked up to the church door to be greeted by the very excited bridesmaids and pageboys which included Princess Charlotte and Prince George.  A group of local well-wishers were allowed to come close to the church and were able to see all the guests arrive - including tennis star, Roger Federer. Less than an hour later, the pair left the church as husband and wife. They posed for photographs before leading their guests - by foot - through the park back to Englefield House for a reception, before carrying on to their party at Pippa's parents' house in Bucklebury.  The best man was reality TV star Spencer Matthews, the groom's 28-year-old younger brother. Miss Middleton's diamond engagement ring is reported to have cost £250,000 - nearly 10 times the budget for the average wedding day. But details of the couple's wedding bands have not been revealed.  Englefield resident Elizabeth Mary Reeves sported a silver wristband with the wedding date 20.05.17 printed on, given exclusively to locals who were let into the private church grounds to get a better look. She said of the bride: ""She stood and waved and looked just lovely. As all brides do, they glow, no matter how expensive their dress is. ""She looked absolutely beautiful."" The 68-year-old, whose daughter and son married at the same church, said the bride and groom looked ""very happy"" as they waved to the small crowd gathered on the church green. ""(Prince) George was waving, (Princess) Charlotte was waving and Kate stooped next to them. ""I just love it. I think it's so good for the village, so good for the country, and it just gives it a happy mood and we need a happy mood."" After the ceremony, guests will celebrate the marriage in a large glass marquee, erected on the Middleton family's property. Among the members of the public who gathered in the village was Meryl Elizabeth Evans, from south Wales. ""It's a nice atmosphere, everybody's friendly, it's just a nice country feel to it,"" she said.   ""We've met people from around the world, and the camera crews are from everywhere.

"Iran election: Hassan Rouhani says voters rejected extremism Moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said his re-election shows voters reject extremism and want more links with the outside world. After avoiding a run-off with a 57% outright victory over his main rival, Mr Rouhani said he respected his opponents' right to criticise him. Mr Rouhani, 68, supports the landmark deal to curb Iran's nuclear programme. The decisive victory gives him a strong mandate to seek reforms and revive the country's ailing economy, analysts say. ""The Iranian nation has chosen the path of interaction with the world, a path which is distant from extremism and violence,"" Mr Rouhani said in his first speech after the victory, broadcast on state television. ""The election is now over. I am the president of the nation and need assistance from every single Iranian, even those who oppose me and my policies."" Mr Rouhani also thanked former reformist President Mohammad Khatami, apparently defying a media ban on citing the ex-leader's name. Turnout in the election was unexpectedly high, at about 70%.  And this is thought to have helped Mr Rouhani, who received close to 23 million votes out of the 40 million that were cast. His main challenger, former prosecutor Ebrahim Raisi received 38.5%, or 15.7 million votes, which was not enough to take the election to a second round.  On Twitter, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the election had showed the ""increasing progress"" of the ""Iranian nation"". Mr Khamenei said Iran would demonstrate ""national dignity"" and ""wisdom"" in relations with other countries. But he did not congratulate Mr Rouhani for his victory. There were celebrations in the capital, Tehran, with young people singing and dancing in the central Vali Asr Square, despite efforts by police to move them, the AFP news agency reported. The economy seems to be the number one issue. Average Iranians say they do not feel the economic benefits after international sanctions were lifted as a result of a nuclear deal signed between Iran, the US and other countries in 2015. While oil exports have rebounded and inflation is back at single-digits, unemployment remains high, especially among young people. Mr Rouhani also promised a moderate vision and an outward-looking Iran and, at rallies, openly attacked the conservative-dominated judiciary and security services.  But Mr Rouhani's own powers are limited by those of Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the last say on many crucial and strategic issues. Another challenge, experts say, comes from abroad, and relations with the new US government under President Donald Trump. Mr Trump opposes the nuclear deal which eased sanctions on the Middle Eastern country, describing it as the ""worst deal ever"". But, despite the objections, the White House renewed the agreement earlier this week. Iran's hardliners had pulled out all the stops and mobilised all their resources to bring out as many people as possible to grab the last centre of power in Iran that was not under their control, namely the executive branch.  Sensing an effort by the hardliners, supporters of President Rouhani who back his promises to steer the country toward moderation came out in big numbers too. Turnout has been unprecedented. In Tehran, five million people turned out to vote - twice as many as in 2013.  This was a revenge of the people against the hardliners who intimidated them, jailed them, executed them, drove them to exile, pushed them out of their jobs, and discriminated against women.  President Rouhani will now have a bigger mandate to push through his reforms, to put an end to extremism, to build bridges with the outside world, to put the economy back on track. Iranians have said a resounding Yes to President Rouhani who, in recent years and particularly during the last several weeks of campaigning, promised to expand individual and political freedoms and make all those centres of power, like the Revolutionary Guard, accountable. The results were announced as Mr Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia, Iran's biggest regional rival, for his first foreign trip as president. In Riyadh, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said he hoped Mr Rouhani would use his new term to ""dismantle a network of terrorism and end [its] ballistic missile programme"". But Iran denies any involvement in terrorism and says its missile programme, which has recently been targeted by Mr Trump with new sanctions, does not breach UN resolutions. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir described the election as a ""domestic matter"", and said Iran was meddling in Arab countries and providing support for the extremist group al-Qaeda. Meanwhile, the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, congratulated Mr Rouhani for the ""strong mandate received"" and said that Europe was ready to work for better ""engagement"" and ""regional peace"".",Sunday 21 May 2017,21-May-17,Rouhani: Iran said No to extremism,The president says his re-election shows that Iranians want more interaction with the world.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39987338

"California botulism outbreak linked to petrol station's nacho cheese An outbreak of severe food poisoning in Sacramento, California, that left nine people in hospital has been linked to cheese sauce sold on nacho crisps at a family-run petrol station. Health officials have stopped Valley Oak Food and Fuel selling food. Cases of botulism, a rare and sometimes fatal form of food poisoning, were first reported on 5 May and in total nine people are confirmed to have it. One of the victims is reportedly so ill she cannot speak or keep her eyes open. Dr Oliva Kasirye of the Sacramento County Public Health Department told reporters that preliminary testing showed the cheese was carrying botulism. The family of one of the affected patients has already filed a lawsuit against the petrol station, claiming neglect. Botulism poisoning is caused by toxins released by a type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. Human digestive processes cannot break down the toxic chemical, which moves to the nervous system. Symptoms emerge in adults 18-36 hours after eating contaminated food. In this case, it is thought the nacho cheese sauce may have been canned. Tinned food is a risk for botulism because the bacterium grows best when there is no oxygen around. In adults, symptoms - including difficulty walking or swallowing, impaired vision and potential convulsions or paralysis - will emerge between 18 and 36 hours after eating the contaminated food.

"Brazil president seeks suspension of corruption investigation Brazil's President Michel Temer says he will ask the Supreme Court to suspend an investigation against him, because vital evidence has been ""manipulated"". In a defiant speech, Mr Temer said a secret audio recording, in which he allegedly discusses the payment of hush money to a jailed politician, needed to be validated. Mr Temer is suspected of corruption and obstruction of justice which he denies. Despite growing calls for him to go, Mr Temer repeated that he would not quit. In the audio recording, made at a meeting with Joesley Batista, president of giant meat-packing firm JBS, Mr Temer appears to be discussing bribes to the former speaker of the lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, who is serving a prison sentence for corruption. The money would be in exchange for Cunha's silence over Mr Temer's alleged implication in Brazil's wide-ranging corruption scandal known as Operation Car Wash.  The probe, launched in March 2014, centres on companies that were offered deals with state oil giant Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and political party slush funds. The scandal has engulfed Brazilian politics, with a third of Mr Temer's cabinet under investigation for alleged corruption. Former president Lula is already facing five charges. The man Mr Temer allegedly condoned the bribery to - Eduardo Cunha - is in prison for corruption, money laundering and tax evasion. Both men played a key role in the downfall of Ms Rousseff, who was removed from office accused of illegally manipulating government accounts. She denies all the charges. The president is biding his time by asking the Supreme Court to suspend investigations until the audio is verified, and justice Edson Fachin's decision to order the verification may give him some breathing room.  But the crisis is unravelling quickly, with the first party of the ruling coalition having decided to leave the government on Saturday; and the remaining coalition members assessing whether it's time to abandon ship.  While the president struggles to save his mandate, the economic and political elites are already discussing the day after - and the possible scenarios would President Temer resign, suffer impeachment or have the 2014 election result annulled by Brazil's Electoral Court.  ""I have never bought anyone's silence, haven't obstructed justice and haven't done anything against the judiciary,"" Mr Temer said in the televised address at the presidential palace on Saturday. Mr Temer is already deeply unpopular in Brazil but his centre-right party has been able to govern as part of a coalition. He took office a year ago, after President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment.

"Trump urges Muslim leaders to lead fight against radicalisation US President Donald Trump has urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation in a major speech in Saudi Arabia. ""Drive them out of this earth,"" he told regional leaders in Riyadh, as part of his first official trip abroad. Mr Trump blamed Iran, Saudi Arabia's rival, for instability in the region.  His speech is seen as an attempted reset with Muslims after his harsh campaign rhetoric stirred concerns in the Islamic world. Mr Trump had previously suggested he would be open to creating a database of all the Muslims in the US. And he had also called for Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the US over security concerns. But, speaking in the Saudi capital to leaders of 55 Muslim-majority countries, Mr Trump called this a ""new chapter"", saying he was not there to ""lecture"" them or impose the American way of life. The fight against extremism, he added, was not a battle between different faiths or civilizations: ""This is a battle between good and evil"". ""A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists, and drive out the extremists"". But, he added, the countries could not wait for ""American power"" to act, and had to ""fulfil their part of the burden"". He singled out Iran for criticism, accusing it of fuelling sectarian conflict and supporting ""unspeakable crimes"" by the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.  Responding on Twitter, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif mockingly called Saudi Arabia ""that bastion of democracy and moderation"" and suggested that the US was milking the country for billions of dollars in newly-signed arms deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn). Behind the lavish praise heaped on his hosts, President Trump used this speech to deliver a tough message to Arab and Muslim governments: deal with the ideology that fuels terrorism now or live with it for generations to come. He went out of his way to avoid the sort of inflammatory language he's more usually known for. His repeated condemnation of Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran will have pleased the Gulf Arab leaders listening. Unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, this US president made no mention of human rights or democracy. But he did condemn the oppression of women. And amongst several cynical reactions to the speech from around the region on social media, some have pointed out that here in Saudi Arabia women are forbidden to drive and there are no parliamentary elections. In Iran, the country accused by Mr Trump of being behind much of the current terrorism across the Middle East, they have just had a free election and women are free to drive. Analysts said the speech was a change for Mr Trump, who is trying to redefine his relationship with the Muslim world after several controversial remarks, including an interview last year in which he famously said: ""I think Islam hates us."" His highly anticipated address did not include the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"", which he had used before and is considered offensive by many Muslims. A transcript of the text published on his Facebook page included a mention of ""Islamist extremism"" and ""Islamist terror groups"". But in his speech Mr Trump said: ""That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds."" It was not immediately clear if he stumbled over the word or decided to change the script. Meanwhile, the US and six Gulf states announced a deal to co-ordinate their efforts aimed at cutting off sources of money for extremist groups, including so-called Islamic State (IS). The countries - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain - are involved in the fight against the militants, but have been accused of backing the group and other Sunni militants - most notably in a 2014 email by Hillary Clinton released by Wikileaks. ""The unique piece of it is that every single one of them are signatories on how they're responsible and will actually prosecute the financing of terrorism, including individuals,"" said Dina Powell, US Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategy. Mr Trump's eight-day trip will also take in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Brussels, the Vatican, and Sicily.

"North Korea confirms 'successful' new ballistic missile test North Korea has confirmed it ""successfully"" launched another medium-range ballistic missile on Sunday. The state-run KCNA news agency said the weapon was now ready to be deployed for military action. The White House said the missile had a shorter range than those used in North Korea's last three tests. It comes a week after North Korea tested what it said was a new type of rocket capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead. Last Monday, the UN Security Council again demanded that Pyongyang conduct no further such tests. It stressed the importance of North Korea ""immediately showing sincere commitment to denuclearisation through concrete action"". The Council is now scheduled to meet behind closed doors on Tuesday - a meeting requested by the US, South Korea and Japan. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw the launch of the Pukguksong-2 missile on Sunday, KCNA reports, adding that he had ""approved the deployment of this weapon system for action."" South Korea's foreign ministry earlier said the launch was ""reckless and irresponsible"", while US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described it as ""disappointing"" and ""disturbing"". The latest missile flew about 560km (350 miles) towards the Sea of Japan, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Last week's missile travelled about 700km.  Japanese news agencies said the missile probably fell into the sea outside Japanese waters. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference a protest had been lodged with North Korea. North Korea is known to be developing both nuclear weapons - it has conducted five nuclear tests - and the missiles capable of delivering those weapons to their target. Both are in defiance of UN sanctions. South Korea said the latest test was conducted in Pukchang, in the west of the country. A missile exploded soon after take-off from Pukchang last month. Earlier on Sunday, the North's state-run media had said it would continue to launch more ""weapons capable of striking"" the US. In early May, the US said a missile defence system it had installed in South Korea was now operational. The Thaad system can intercept North Korean missiles, although full operational capability is still some months away. North Korea and its ally China have condemned the installation of the system. However, there is no sign that Thaad was used against the missile tested on Sunday.  Newly-installed South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who is seeking deeper engagement with the North, has convened an urgent meeting of his national security council in response. This would be the 10th detected missile launch by North Korea this year - outside experts agree that it's making progress in its stated aim of having the ability to strike the mainland US with nuclear weapons. Though it's not there yet, the latest tests have been of missiles capable of reaching American bases in the Western Pacific, albeit with some failures. There is intense pressure on Kim Jong-un from the US, which is seeking the help of China. Repeated and more frequent testing of missiles, despite prohibition by the United Nations, indicates the North Korean leader feels able to defy that pressure.",Monday 22 May 2017,22-May-17,North Korea confirms new missile test,The medium-range ballistic missile was launched days after the UN demanded tests should stop.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39990836
"Brazil police raid Sao Paulo 'Crackland' and make arrests Brazilian police have arrested nearly 40 people for drug trafficking offences in central Sao Paulo where crack cocaine has been sold and consumed freely for years.  About 500 armed police officers were involved in the operation.  Dozens of addicts reacted in anger, vandalising cars and looting shops. Sao Paulo's centre-right Mayor Joao Doria said the operation marked the end of impunity in the area, widely known as Cracolandia or Crackland.  Critics say the move will merely push the problem to other parts of the city. Mr Doria promised to knock down many buildings and redevelop the streets near the Luz train station that have become an open-air drugs market over the past decade. ""Crackland doesn't exist any more and it won't come back. The government won't allow it,"" said Mr Doria during the operation. He also announced that CCTV cameras would be installed in that part of the city. But he later admitted in a press conference that ""it will be difficult to put an end to a historical problem"". ""Police will be deployed here permanently and the problem will be reduced,"" Mr Doria said. The governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, said state rehab centres had 3,000 places available for addiction treatments. The mayor and the governor recently announced a plan to combat drug trafficking in the region. The previous left-wing mayor of Sao Paulo, Fernando Haddad, had a programme that tried to solve addiction through therapy and without the use of force by police. But many were critical and felt that something had to be done about Crackland, which became a no-go area for most residents of Brazil's largest city.",Monday 22 May 2017,22-May-17,Brazil police raid Sao Paulo 'Crackland',Some 500 officers took part in the operation in an area where crack cocaine has been consumed freely.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39994177
"Mount Everest's famous Hillary Step destroyed, mountaineers confirm A famous feature of Mount Everest has collapsed, potentially making the world's highest peak even more dangerous to climbers. Mountaineers said the Hillary Step may have fallen victim to Nepal's devastating 2015 earthquake.  The near-vertical 12m (39ft) rocky outcrop stood on the mountain's southeast ridge, and was the last great challenge before the top. It was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first to scale it in 1953. British mountaineer Tim Mosedale confirmed the news of the Step's demise on Facebook after reaching the summit on 16 May. Speaking to the BBC, he said the loss of the Step was ""the end of an era"". ""It is associated with the history of Everest, and it is a great shame a piece of mountaineering folklore has disappeared,"" Mr Mosedale said. Back in May 2016, pictures posted by the American Himalayan Foundation appeared to show that the Hillary Step had changed shape. But thanks to the snowfall, it was hard to tell for sure. This year, with less snow, it was clear the Step had gone. ""It was reported last year, and indeed I climbed it last year, but we weren't sure for certain that 'The Step' had gone because the area was blasted with snow,"" Mr Mosedale wrote on Facebook. He concluded: ""This year, however, I can report that the chunk of rock named 'The Hillary Step' is definitely not there any more."" Mr Mosedale, who is due to go back up Everest later this month, said he believed the Step was most likely a victim of Nepal's 2015 earthquake. ""It could well just be gravity, but I would suspect the earthquake was the cause,"" he told the BBC. Mountaineers claim the snow-covered slope will be much easier to climb than the notorious rock-face, but have warned that it could create a bottleneck.  It is a serious worry for those already battling low oxygen and frostbite conditions at the top of the world. Speaking to the BBC in 2012, British mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington said getting stuck near the Step could be fatal.  ""If it's a perfectly fine day, it doesn't really matter too much if you are delayed for say, an hour and a half, two hours on the Hillary Step, which is just short of the summit. ""If the weather is breaking up, that two-and-a-half hour wait can be a matter of life and death."" The routes up Everest from Nepal and Tibet are already very hazardous, the BBC's Richard Galpin reports. Four climbers were killed on Sunday, he says.

"Venezuela protests: Man set alight as death toll rises Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused opposition protesters of setting alight a government supporter in Caracas on the 50th day of protests. Orlando José Figuera suffered burns to 80% of his body after he was engulfed in flames. Officials said he was also stabbed in Saturday's protests. Witnesses said the crowd had accused the man of being a thief. On the same day, an opposition activist was shot dead, bringing the total number killed in recent protests to 48.  The attorney general's office said gunmen allegedly opened fire on the demonstrators in the western city of Valera.  Edy Alejandro Teran Aguilar died from a gunshot wound to the chest, while two others were wounded. Protesters demanding President Maduro step down and hold elections took to the streets across the country on Saturday to mark the 50th day of the increasingly violent demonstrations which have overwhelmed the country in recent weeks. ""A person was set on fire, beaten up, stabbed... They nearly lynched him, just because he shouted out that he was a 'Chavista',"" President Maduro said, referring to the ruling Socialist movement set up by his predecessor Hugo Chavez. Speaking on his weekly TV programme, Mr Maduro described it as  ""a hate crime and a crime against humanity"". It is thought 46 people were injured in the demonstration in eastern Caracas where Mr Figuera, 21, was hurt. Journalist and politician Earle Herrera said the man had been accused of being a thief, according to AFP news agency. Venezuelan Information Minister Ernesto Villegas tweeted it was ""growing insanity"". ""A human being is set on fire at a 'peaceful demonstration' by the opposition in Caracas,"" he wrote, posting a video of the incident. Protests have been taking place across Venezuela for seven weeks, as anger towards Mr Maduro and his government rises. Seven in 10 people are said to oppose Mr Maduro, according to private surveys. Despite having the world's largest known oil reserves, Venezuela is facing a shortage of many basic items, including food and medicines. Its economy has collapsed, with inflation expected to top 700% this year, and crime is rampant. The opposition is calling for early elections and the release of opposition politicians jailed in recent years, saying the socialist governments of Mr Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, have mismanaged the economy since coming to power in 1999.",Monday 22 May 2017,22-May-17,Venezuelan protesters set man on fire,"The latest incident happened on the 50th day of demonstrations, which saw the death toll rise to 48.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39994965
"Cannes festival: Netflix film Meyerowitz Stories 'made for big screen' The director of a second film at the centre of a row over Netflix's place at Cannes said he always intended for it to be seen on the big screen. Noah Baumbach said he made The Meyerowitz Stories ""as I make all my movies, with the expectation it will be shown on the big screen"". There has been controversy over Netflix's features being included in the competition for the Palme d'Or. Netflix has not screened its productions in French cinemas. But Baumbach said he made The Meyerowitz Stories, starring Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman,  ""independently, with independent money"" and it was acquired by Netflix in post-production.  The family comedy drama, which features Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler as half-brothers reunited as they plan an exhibition for their sculptor father Harold (played by Hoffman), is his first to be shown at the French film festival. There were a few boos as the Netflix logo was shown at the film's first showing, on Sunday morning - but the cheers were louder. That was a marked difference from the reception given to Okja, the other film from the Netflix stable, which received loud boos during the opening credits - and both times round, as it had to be restarted due to technical issues. Baumbach said of the importance of the cinema screen: ""I believe in that and I think it's unique and singular - an experience that's not going to go away, in my opinion. ""Netflix acquired [the film] in post-production and they've been hugely supportive."" Cannes jury president Pedro Almodovar said last week that he could not imagine the Palme d'Or going to a film that had not received a cinema release, stressing the importance of the big screen. Baumbach said he hadn't heard those quotes, while Hoffman traced the shape of a TV with his hands as he added: ""I have a very big screen"". From next year, films will have to be released in French cinemas if they want to be considered. It was a high-spirited news conference, with Rain Man star Hoffman asking a journalist for his side profile at one point, so he could see the shape of his nose - after the reporter said people had asked if he was related to the star. And when another said the film was ""interesting"", he replied: ""That's not a good word. You didn't like it, did you?"" Stiller, who also played Hoffman's son in comedy Meet the Fockers, said how much he had enjoyed seeing his co-star's films when growing up. But a mock grumpy Hoffman retorted: ""I resent people saying they grew up with my work. Everyone who's older than me - please stand up."" Even if anyone did fit that bill, no-one got to their feet. Emma Thompson plays Harold's third wife Maureen, an alcoholic who wears beads and tie-dye tunics. She said of her role in the dysfunctional family drama: ""Because I'm not from America, or that kind of family, it was a foreign country to me. ""I read it, and thought: 'I have no idea what's going to happen, but it's going to be fascinating'."" Thompson said she considered almost all of the characters to be suffering from shame, for a variety of reasons - Harold as he has not been as successful as some of his peers, his son Danny (Sandler) as he has no money and Matthew (Stiller) because he does have money. ""Everyone's ashamed,"" she mused. ""So many people feel that way all of the time. ""Our culture is built around this shaming thing. That's why I think it's so powerful."" She praised the film for being both ""very funny, and then suddenly terribly moving"" and said she found the process of making it ""extremely rewarding."" And it seemed the work paid off, with applause from critics at the end, and generally positive reviews - many praising Sandler in particular. Stiller, appearing at a Hollywood Foreign Press Association gala for the International Rescue Committee, said the premiere on Sunday night received a standing ovation for Hoffman.  Describing it as his favourite Cannes moment, he said: ""It was an amazing acknowledgement - he's had a wonderful career.  ""To present a movie with him - and to watch the joy that was on Dustin Hoffman's face as he received this wonderful ovation… for me to be in close proximity to that was wonderful.""  Mistress America and Maggie's Plan actress Greta Gerwig, the partner of Baumbach, said: ""I had never seen it on a big screen before. And I looked around at the end, and saw all of these people weeping. Noah was crying, Dustin was crying. It's one of those things you just hear about happening."" Hoffman himself described it as a ""special film"".  Thompson - who'd taken off her heels to be more comfortable - was also at the beachfront party, alongside co-star Sandler, as well as Tilda Swinton and Jake Gylenhaal, who star in Okja.

"TPP trade deal will continue without Trump Asia-Pacific trade ministers have agreed to resuscitate the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, despite US President Donald Trump abandoning it. Mr Trump signalled in January he would block the passage of the 12-nation pact in order to protect American jobs. Trade ministers from the 11 remaining countries have met in Vietnam to get the deal back on track. The representatives also agreed to help the US rejoin the deal at any time. The bid to revive the TPP, which would have covered 40% of the global economy, was led by trade ministers from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand trade minister Todd McClay said the remaining countries ""are committed to finding a way forward to deliver"" the deal. Although the door will be kept open for the US to rejoin the pact, its trade representative Robert Lighthizer said it would not return to the TPP. ""The United States pulled out of the TPP and it's not going to change that decision.""

"Egypt refers 48 to court over Coptic church bombings Egypt's public prosecutor says 48 suspected members of so-called Islamic State (IS) have been referred to a military court in connection with three bombings of Coptic churches. Thirty-one of the suspects are in custody while the others are still at large. More than 70 people died in suicide attacks against churches in Cairo in December and in the cities of Tanta and Alexandria in April. IS said it carried out the bombings.  In a statement on Sunday, public prosecutor Nabil Sadek said some of the suspects were leaders within IS and had formed cells in Cairo and the southern province of Qena to carry out the church attacks. He said the militants were also responsible for killing eight police officers at a checkpoint in Egypt's Western Desert in January. The attack in December killed 29 people at Saint Peter and Saint Paul Church in central Cairo, close to the headquarters of Coptic Pope Tawadros II. In April, 45 worshippers celebrating Palm Sunday died in attacks at St George's Coptic church in Tanta and St Mark's in Alexandria. IS has threatened more attacks on Egypt's Coptic Christians, who make up 10% of the population. Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced a three-month state of emergency after the attacks in April. The Coptic Orthodox Church is the main Christian Church in Egypt.

The Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ.

"Iran elections: Pro-Rouhani reformists in Tehran power sweep Iran's re-elected moderate President Hassan Rouhani has received a further boost after reformists won key council elections in the capital, Tehran. The pro-Rouhani reformist group Omid (Hope) won all 21 seats, ousting their conservative rivals who had been in power for 14 years. Mr Rouhani won Friday's presidential election in the first round.

"Malaga 0-2 Real Madrid   Real Madrid won their first La Liga title since 2012 thanks to a final-day victory at Malaga. Cristiano Ronaldo scored early on to settle the nerves, latching onto Isco's through ball to step around Carlos Kameni and tap into an empty net. Karim Benzema added their second goal after the break after Kameni parried Sergio Ramos' shot. Real, who had only needed a point, now face Juventus in the Champions League final looking to complete a double. Barcelona, who had won the past two titles, came from 2-0 down to beat Eibar 4-2 but they had needed Real to slip up if they were going to retain the trophy. The result means Zinedine Zidane, in his first full season as Real boss, is the first manager to lead Madrid to the Spanish league title since Jose Mourinho five years ago. If Real beat Juventus in Cardiff, they will become the first team to successfully defend the Champions League - with Zidane having won the tournament six months into the job last summer. Real Madrid are deserved champions, having been the best team in Spain - and probably Europe - for most of the season. Their squad is starting to look less reliant on Benzema, Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, who was out injured - even though the first two players scored their goals at Malaga. Isco, who was impressive again, and Alvaro Morata have shown themselves to be quality players when given the chance. When Barca beat Real in El Clasico on 23 April, it gave renewed hope for an exciting title race - but Real won their last six games to win the league by three points. And there was never any title peril on the final day once Ronaldo rounded Kameni to score the second-minute opener. Malaga had chances, with former Barca striker Sandro impressive. But with nothing to play for themselves, they never really looked like winning. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane: ""It was very important [to win the league]. It was a lot of years without winning it and we knew that the league is everything. ""For Real Madrid, because it is the best club in the world, we have to return with this league title. ""He [Ronaldo] is always there to make the difference and I am happy for him - it is a little different because he is always there to do it. ""It has been a difficult season that we worked hard for, with some tough moments, but after 38 games we are top and that is it.

"Switzerland votes to phase out nuclear power Switzerland has voted to phase out nuclear power in favour of renewable energy. More than 58% backed the move towards greener power sources in a referendum on Sunday. Switzerland has five ageing nuclear power plants, which provide a third of the country's energy needs. There is no date yet to decommission the facilities, but the country will now aim to increase reliance on sources like solar, wind and hydro power. Opponents had warned the move away from nuclear energy would cost too much money and lead to the landscape being ""disfigured"". But the president of Switzerland's Green party, Regula Rytz, hailed the vote as a ""moment of historic change"". ""The Swiss population has said 'no' to the construction of new nuclear power plants and yes to the development of renewable energy,"" she added. ""The conditions have also been set whereby the economy and households will need to take responsibility for the future.  ""It's absolutely magnificent."" The Swiss government first proposed phasing out nuclear energy in favour of renewables after Japan's Fukushima plant was destroyed in a tsunami in 2011. The vote now paves the way for them to move ahead with the plan, beginning in January 2018. However, a referendum which asked if people wanted to limit the nuclear plants lifespan to 45 years failed to get enough support in November.",Monday 22 May 2017,22-May-17,Swiss vote to phase out nuclear power,The referendum result allows the government to go ahead with plans to switch to renewable energy.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39994599
"Whales die off coast of East Anglia Three whales have died off the coast of East Anglia. An area south of Felixstowe Pier in Suffolk has been sealed off after a 30ft (9m) female whale washed up on the beach there.  The first whale, a minke calf, was spotted on a mudbank in the River Ore, near Felixstowe, on Saturday afternoon. Another dead adult whale was seen in the water off Harwich, Essex. Coastal volunteers believe they could be part of a much wider pod. For whale updates, visit BBC Local Live: Suffolk John Cresswell, from the Felixstowe Volunteer Coast Patrol Rescue Service, said it was normal for porpoises to wash up on the shore, but not whales. ""This is very sad,"" he said. ""It is such a loss to the ocean life. ""They are such amazing mammals."" He said council officials were planning to call in a special company to dispose of the whale that washed up on the beach, after plans to tow it up the coast and ""let nature take its course"" were abandoned over fears the carcass could become a hazard.",Monday 22 May 2017,22-May-17,Whales die off English coast,Coastal volunteers believe the three whales could be part of a much wider pod.,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-39991646
"Ex-national security adviser 'lied' on security clearance Ex-US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn ""lied"" about income from Russian companies while renewing his security clearance, a top Democrat says. Elijah Cummings released a letter that shows Mr Flynn said his foreign trips were paid for by US firms, but a Moscow visit was funded by a Russian company. The claim follows Mr Flynn's refusal to hand files to a Senate panel probing alleged Russian political meddling. He was fired after misleading the White House about his Russian contacts. The fresh allegations against him came hours after he invoked his right against self-incrimination on Monday and failed to co-operate with a Senate panel's investigation on possible links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.  The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena - a legal summons - two weeks ago to obtain documents related to Mr Flynn's contacts with Russians dating back to June 2015. But in a letter to the panel, his lawyers said he was rejecting its request in response to the current political climate and an ""escalating public frenzy against him"". The former Army lieutenant general is invoking the fifth amendment to the US constitution, which protects Americans from being legally compelled to testify against themselves in a criminal case. Mr Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, later published a letter urging the panel's chairman, Jason Chaffetz, to subpoena the documents.  The letter highlights a February 2016 interview in which Mr Flynn told security clearance investigators that he was paid by US companies when he travelled to Moscow to dine at a gala with Russian President Vladimir Putin the year before. But the trip was actually paid for by Russian state news agency RT.  If Mr Flynn did lie to investigators, he could face felony charges and up to five years in prison.  Also on Monday, a new report claims President Trump allegedly asked two top national security officials to publicly deny that there was any evidence of collusion. The Washington Post says he made the request to Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and Admiral Michael S Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, in March. Both refused to comply with the request, the newspaper quoted current and former officials as saying. The White House has not yet commented on the allegations. Mr Flynn has been mired in controversy since he stood down from his new role as national security adviser in February.  It emerged that he had misled the White House about discussing US sanctions against Russia with Moscow's envoy, Sergei Kislyak, before Mr Trump took office. Shortly after Mr Flynn left the White House, the Department of Defense also launched an inquiry into the payments he received for the RT gala, and for lobbying on Turkey's behalf.  Senate Intelligence Committee chairmen Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner said they were ""disappointed"" at his decision not to hand over files on Monday.  However Mr Flynn's letter to the Senate panel says that his refusal to testify is not an admission of wrongdoing. If Mr Flynn continues to refuse to comply, it is thought Senate investigators could vote to hold him in contempt of Congress or even refer his case for possible criminal charges. Two other former top Trump aides - Paul Manafort and Roger Stone - have reportedly complied with the committee's request for information.  Two congressional inquiries and an FBI investigation are looking into claims that Russian hackers tried to help Mr Trump win last November's presidential election, and whether members of his campaign colluded with the alleged Kremlin conspiracy.  Mr Trump injected fresh impetus into the Senate investigation after he himself met the Russian ambassador and foreign minister in the White House earlier this month, only a day after firing FBI chief James Comey. The US president said in that encounter that Mr Comey was a ""real nut job"" and his dismissal eased ""a great pressure because of Russia"", the New York Times reported. Last week, former FBI director Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to lead the FBI investigation following Mr Comey's dismissal.",Tuesday 23 May 2017,23-May-17,Mike Flynn ducks Senate's Russia inquiry,President Trump's fired national security adviser is to refuse to give key papers to Congress.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40004300

Sign in  or  Register You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It’s the law. By Megan Fisher and Paul Gribben All times stated are UK As the UK terror threat level is raised to its highest level, we ask what does that mean? Police have arrested a man in the Moss Side area of Manchester in connection with Monday's attack.  Eight men remain in custody as part of the investigation, Greater Manchester Police say. The Question Time debate turns to the leaking of details of the Manchester investigation - including photos from the scene - to the US media. Amber Rudd says Theresa May has raised the matter with US President Donald Trump, and that she does not think the leaks have damaged the investigation. The home secretary, who has previously expressed her irritation at the reports appearing in the US media, adds: ""It must have been such a terrible thing for the families to see."" Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham says what has happened is ""absolutely outrageous"". ""It's wrong, it's arrogant of the Americans and it's disrespectful to the people of Greater Manchester and most importantly the families of those who have died."" ""I'm a proud Manc and a proud Muslim"", says a man in the Question Time audience. ""What happened on Monday night was an evil act and abhorrent act,"" he says. He warns that Muslims can be ""collateral"" damage after a terror attack if Islamophobia increases. Let's not be divided, he says. The home secretary rejects criticism of cuts to police budgets, which some warn have affected on-the-ground intelligence about possible extremism. ""We must not imply that this terrorist activity would not have taken place if there were more police,"" she says, on Question Time. Good counter-terrorism policy relies on strong relationships between the police and the intelligence services, she says: ""It's not about those pure numbers on the street."" She adds: ""It's not about policing, so much as engaging with community leaders in the area."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham says the prime minister and home secretary have taken decisive action and should be commended. He goes on to praise the reaction of the city in coming together and the response of the emergency services, following Monday's attack. ""This is the greatest city in the world and I couldn't be more proud of it,"" he adds. Question Time is up and running in Salford, Greater Manchester.  A man in the audience says, as a father of two young girls, he finds it hard coming to terms with the Manchester suicide bomb attack. Amber Rudd says she does too, and that the important thing is to let the investigation take place. Nazir Afzal, the chairman of the Police and Crime Commissioners Association, says a conversation is also needed about ""deradicalisation"" and engaging communities. Gabriel Gatehouse tells the BBC's Newsnight that Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi and his father, who has been detained by militia in Libya, fought against Colonel Gaddafi as part of a campaign to topple his regime.

"Park Geun-hye: S Korea trial of impeached president begins South Korea's former President Park Geun-hye has pleaded not guilty at her trial for corruption, the latest stage in her dramatic fall from grace. The ousted president faces charges including bribery, abusing state power and leaking state secrets. In her first appearance in public since her arrest in March, she arrived at court handcuffed in a prison van.  The maximum sentence for corruption in South Korea is life.  Ms Park is accused of colluding with her friend, Choi Soon-sil, to extort money from some of South Korea's biggest companies, including Samsung, in return for political favours.  Ms Choi Soon-sil, who is also facing charges, sat alongside Ms Park at the opening of the trial. She also denies wrongdoing. As the trial opened in Seoul, the ex-president's lawyers said there was ""no reason for President Park to force companies to donate money which she was unable to use for herself"". At the start of the trial which will determine whether she completes a transition from the presidential palace to a prison cell, Park Geun-hye was asked what her occupation was. She replied ""unemployed"". She now faces months of trying to persuade the judges that she didn't pressure companies into giving millions of dollars to the life-long friend who sits alongside her in court number 417, the two separated only by a lawyer. They did not greet each with either a word or even a glance. Ms Park wore a black suit rather than her prison garb. On her chest, worn like a broach: a badge with the number 503 - her prison number. She had a hairclip provided by the prison because her normal hairpins were taken away as potentially dangerous.  Ms Park is facing a total of 18 charges, with the charge sheet running to about 120,000 pages, South Korean media report. Prosecutors say she allowed Ms Choi to use her presidential connections to pressure companies to give money to a foundation she established, earning them tens of millions of dollars.  In exchange, the companies would receive favourable treatment from the government, it is alleged.  Ms Park is also accused of leaking state secrets by giving Ms Choi access to her work - including asking her to edit her speeches - and of running a blacklist of media figures who were to be barred from receiving state support because they had been critical of her government.  Ms Park is the third South Korean leader on trial for corruption but the first democratically elected one.  The two previous cases involved former military dictators imprisoned on corruption in the 1990s.  Ms Park's hearing takes place in the very same court room as the previous trials.  Dozens of people have now been investigated or arrested in connection with the scandal. All have maintained their innocence.  Ms Choi, who also denies wrongdoing, has been on trial since December, while her daughter, Chung Yoo-ra - alleged to have received help getting a university placement - was arrested in Denmark in January. The acting head of Samsung Group, Lee Jae-Yong, and four other Samsung executive are on trial for allegedly giving bribes to Ms Park and Ms Choi in exchange for government support for a controversial merger.  Former health minister Moon Hyung-pyo and the chief investment officer of the National Pension Service (NPS) Hong Wan-seon are on trial for allegedly pressuring the NPS to accept the merger.  And last week, two plastic surgeons who treated the image-conscious former president - including one who injected her with human placenta extracts - were convicted of lying about having treated her.

"Brazil president retreats from attempts to suspend investigation Brazil's President Michel Temer has asked the Supreme Court to proceed with an investigation against him for obstruction of justice and corruption.  His lawyers say that a secret recording that appears to incriminate him has been edited 70 times.   On Saturday Mr Temer filed a petition at the Supreme Court to have the investigation suspended.  But his lawyers now say they want the investigation to go ahead to have the president's name cleared. His legal team hired an audio expert, who concluded that the tape would not stand up as evidence in a court of law. ""We want this investigation to be concluded as soon as possible,"" said one of his lawyers, Gustavo Guedes. ""The only evidence against him, the recording, is useless,"" added Mr Guedes. Contents of the tape were first released on Brazilian media on Wednesday, causing major political and economic turmoil. President Temer was secretly recorded by Joesley Batista, president of Brazilian giant meat-packing firm JBS, during a late-night, unscheduled meeting. The wealthy businessman made the recording as part of a plea bargain with the prosecutor's office. On the tape, Mr Temer seems to signal his approval for illegal payments to the former speaker of the lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, who was jailed for corruption last year. According to Mr Batista, Cunha was being paid 1 million reais ($300,000; £235,000) a month in exchange for his silence regarding the involvement of other politicians, including Mr Temer, in Brazil's wide-ranging corruption scandal known as Operation Car Wash.  The probe, launched in March 2014, centres on companies that were offered deals with state oil giant Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and political party slush funds. Many expected the president to resign once the contents of the tape were made public.  But he has made it clear that he will fight to serve out his term, which ends on 31 December 2018. ""I have never bought anyone's silence, haven't obstructed justice and haven't done anything against the judiciary,"" Mr Temer said in the televised address at the presidential palace on Saturday. ""I will not resign. I repeat: I will not resign,"" he said on national television. In an interview with Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper published on Monday, Mr Temer said that he had been naive by agreeing to meet Mr Batista in those circumstances. But he insisted that he had not broken the law and that his support in Congress remained strong. ""I will not resign. Oust me if you want, but stepping down would be an admission of guilt,"" he said.  Mr Temer is already deeply unpopular in Brazil but his centre-right party has been able to govern as part of a coalition.  He took office a year ago, after President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment. Both Mr Temer and Cunha played a key role in the downfall of Ms Rousseff, who was removed from office accused of illegally manipulating government accounts. She denies all the charges.

"Greece fails to secure fresh bailout funds Greece has failed to secure a deal to unlock the next instalment of its multi-billion-dollar bailout after talks with eurozone finance ministers broke down. Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem said there was still a gap ""between what could be done and what some of us had expected should be done"". Nonetheless, he said they were ""very close"" to an agreement. Informal talks are expected to continue ahead of the group's 15 June meeting. The Brussels-based meeting was aimed at deciding whether Greece had done enough to receive a €7.5bn (£6.4bn; $8.3bn) loan plus debt relief. The cash is vital for Greece to avoid defaulting on a debt repayment due in July.  To secure the funds, the country has had to enact a series of economic reforms. The International Monetary Fund and Germany are reported to have disagreed over how to help ease the country's debts once its rescue programme ends next year.  The IMF's participation in Greece's latest bailout hinges on resolving this issue.  ""The feeling was.... more work was needed to be able to have that kind of clarity  that the financial markets understood and the Greek people understood (of) what to expect at the end of the programme period in terms of debt relief,"" Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said. However, he also said he was optimistic that a definitive deal could be brokered by the time of the next formal meeting in June. Figures released earlier this month showed that Greece had fallen back into recession for the first time since 2012.

"Republicans used race to redraw North Carolina voter maps The US Supreme Court has ruled that North Carolina Republicans improperly used race as a factor in redrawing 2011 congressional district boundaries. The 5-3 ruling upheld a lower court decision last year forcing legislators to draft new district maps.  Two predominantly black congressional districts are invalidated as a result.  The case was the latest in a number of lawsuits accusing Republicans of trying to limit the influence of black voters by grouping them into districts. The ruling upheld a federal district court decision that found lawmakers had used race to carve out two of North Carolina's 13 House of Representatives districts in order to benefit the Republicans.  North Carolina ballot box battle The targeted districts - the 1st and the 12th - are both held by Democrats. Republicans hold 10 of the state's 13 seats in the House.  State Republicans argued that they tried to increase the districts' black population in order to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters.  But Justice Elena Kagan, who wrote the ruling, said the 1st district ""produced boundaries amplifying divisions between blacks and whites"".  She also said of the 12th that ""race, not politics, accounted for the district's reconfiguration"". The court was unanimous in striking down the 1st district while conservatives Justice Samuel Alito, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented on the 12th district ruling.  They argued that redrawing the 12th district map was used to help Republicans and not to discriminate against black voters.  Justice Alito also said the high court ignored an earlier precedent set in 2001 when it upheld a similar version of the same district.  ""A precedent of this court should not be treated like a disposable household item - say a paper plate or a napkin - to be used once and then tossed in the trash,"" he wrote. Judge Neil Gorsuch, who had not yet joined the court when the arguments were heard, did not participate in the ruling.  Democratic North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a statement: ""The North Carolina Republican legislature tried to rig congressional elections by drawing unconstitutional districts that discriminated against African-Americans and that's wrong."" The Supreme Court in 2015 ruled 5-4 to strike down a lower court's decision that upheld a similar Republican-backed redistricting plan in Alabama.  In a separate case in March, the justices ordered a lower court to review whether Virginia's Republican-controlled legislature tried to unlawfully diminish black voter influence through its redistricting plan.  The court threw out a decision that had upheld all 12 of Virginia's legislature districts that were challenged.

"Trump tells Israel Iran will never have nuclear weapons US President Donald Trump has told Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Iran will never have nuclear weapons. He suggested the Iranians thought they could  ""do what they want"" since negotiating a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015. Mr Trump arrived in Israel from Saudi Arabia, where he sought to win Arab states' support for fighting extremism.  He has called for a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. However, he has been vague about what form it should take, saying he prefers to leave it to both sides to decide between them in direct talks.  The two-day visit to Israel forms part of Mr Trump's first foreign trip as US president.  Speaking in Jerusalem, he said Iran had negotiated a ""fantastic deal"" with his predecessor, Barack Obama, winning ""a lifeline and prosperity"". But ""instead of saying thank you"", the Iranians were backing terrorism, he said. In a speech earlier on Monday, he accused Iran of ""deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias"". ""Iran will never have nuclear weapons, that I can tell you,"" Mr Trump told Mr Netanyahu.  In a deal with world powers in 2015, Iran accepted curbs on its nuclear programme in return for tangible economic benefits, and the White House confirmed last month that the deal was still holding.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who was re-elected for a second term last week, championed the 2015 deal but on Monday he appeared to sweep aside international concern about Iran's missile programme. ""The Iranian nation has decided to be powerful,"" he said on state TV. ""Our missiles are for peace and for defence... American officials should know that whenever we need to technically test a missile, we will do so and will not wait for their permission."" Mr Rouhani also played down Mr Trump's strong criticism of Iran at a summit in Saudi Arabia at the weekend, saying: ""Who can say regional stability can be restored without Iran?"" Forging an anti-Iranian alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia may prove an easier task for President Donald Trump than bringing peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  Having focused on a bitterly contested election, Iranian leaders are now at least ostensibly playing down the emerging threat from a new US administration that has virtually put Iran back in the ""axis of evil"" box.   President Rouhani described Mr Trump's massive arms deal with Saudi Arabia as having ""no practical value"" and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif questioned rhetorically whether the push by the Americans constituted a new foreign policy or just ""milking Saudis"" for hundreds of billions of dollars. Even though any possibility of a military confrontation is not imminent, a tough US stance against Iran could make it much more difficult for the moderate Hassan Rouhani to do business with the outside world, and therefore deliver on his promise of a better economic future for the country. Speaking about the prospect of a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, Mr Trump said, ""I've heard it's one of the toughest deals of all"". But he added that he had a ""feeling that we're going to get there eventually"". President Trump believes he is the world's greatest dealmaker and making peace between Israelis and Palestinians after a century of conflict would be the world's biggest deal, writes Jeremy Bowen, the BBC Middle East editor. During the US election, candidate Trump expressed views that seemed to fit neatly with those of the right-wing Israeli government of Mr Netanyahu - favouring expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied territory and a tough line towards Palestinian aspirations for independence.  But in office, President Trump has been more nuanced - so there has been some nervous speculation on the Israeli right that he might demand concessions from their side, our editor says.  But most people, on both sides of the argument, are deeply sceptical about the chances of any progress, no matter what President Trump says or does while he is here, our editor adds.  Israel and the Palestinians have not held direct talks in just over three years.  Mr Trump is due to meet Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem on Tuesday. Before meeting Mr Netanyahu, he visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where - site of Jesus's burial and resurrection, according to Christian tradition. Then, wearing a Jewish skullcap as a mark of respect, he visited the Western Wall, one of the most sacred sites in Judaism. The wall is a remnant from the time of the Second Jewish Temple, which stood on the plateau above it and was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. Mr Trump could be seen placing what appeared to be a written note between its stones, as is the custom among visitors to leave notes with prayers and requests to God. The president's visit was overshadowed by political difficulties at home. Speaking to Mr Netanyahu on Monday, he sought to dispel suggestions that he had passed on sensitive Israeli intelligence to Russian diplomats at a recent meeting, saying he had not mentioned the word ""Israel"" at the meeting.   Latest reports from the US say Mr Trump's former National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, will refuse to give evidence to the Senate Intelligence Committee after being subpoenaed in connection with Moscow's possible involvement in last year's presidential election.  He will be in Rome to meet Pope Francis and Brussels to see Nato leaders.  On Friday, he will return to Italy for to meet other world leaders at a G7 summit in the Sicilian town of Taormina, where climate change is expected to be discussed.

"Cyril Hanouna: French host humiliated gay men on live TV A record number of people have complained after a French TV presenter posted a spoof ad on a gay dating website and made fun of people who responded live on air. Cyril Hanouna used a feminine tone of voice and tricked those he spoke to into revealing their sexual fantasies. One of the victims was left in a ""state of appalling distress"", LGBT campaigners said. They accused the presenter of homophobia. Nearly 20,000 complaints about the segment on Mr Hanouna's nightly show Touche pas à mon poste (TPMP - ""Don't touch my TV"" in English) had been made to the media regulator by Monday afternoon, reports said. Mr Hanouna had posed online as a bisexual man called Jean-José who was ""very sporty and well endowed"" and ""liked being insulted"", Ouest France newspaper reported. He engaged in suggestive chat with the men who responded as guests, a studio audience and more than a million viewers watched. Nicolas Noguier of Le Refuge, an association that works with young victims of homophobia, wrote on Facebook that one hotline operator had spent most of the night talking to one of the men Mr Hanouna deceived. ""We were devastated by his tears and his fear of being found out by his parents and those around him,"" Mr Noguier said. Joël Deumier, president of SOS Homophobie said the segment was ""scandalous, shameful and homophobic"". ""When you let people get away with behaviour like this, you trivialise homophobic discourse. The sketch was deeply homophobic,"" he said, quoted by the Gay Times. Mr Hanouna said on Friday that he felt ""hurt"" by allegations of homophobia and said it was ""everything he had been fighting against for years and the opposite of TPMP"".

Mr Emerson has spoken out on social media, saying he hopes Mr Hanouna ""learns a lesson"". Mr Hanouna's show has been the subject of complaints about sexism and homophobia before.

"Cyril Hanouna: French host humiliated gay men on live TV A record number of people have complained after a French TV presenter posted a spoof ad on a gay dating website and made fun of people who responded live on air. Cyril Hanouna used a feminine tone of voice and tricked those he spoke to into revealing their sexual fantasies. One of the victims was left in a ""state of appalling distress"", LGBT campaigners said. They accused the presenter of homophobia. Nearly 20,000 complaints about the segment on Mr Hanouna's nightly show Touche pas à mon poste (TPMP - ""Don't touch my TV"" in English) had been made to the media regulator by Monday afternoon, reports said. Mr Hanouna had posed online as a bisexual man called Jean-José who was ""very sporty and well endowed"" and ""liked being insulted"", Ouest France newspaper reported. He engaged in suggestive chat with the men who responded as guests, a studio audience and more than a million viewers watched. Nicolas Noguier of Le Refuge, an association that works with young victims of homophobia, wrote on Facebook that one hotline operator had spent most of the night talking to one of the men Mr Hanouna deceived. ""We were devastated by his tears and his fear of being found out by his parents and those around him,"" Mr Noguier said. Joël Deumier, president of SOS Homophobie said the segment was ""scandalous, shameful and homophobic"". ""When you let people get away with behaviour like this, you trivialise homophobic discourse. The sketch was deeply homophobic,"" he said, quoted by the Gay Times. Mr Hanouna said on Friday that he felt ""hurt"" by allegations of homophobia and said it was ""everything he had been fighting against for years and the opposite of TPMP"". The presenter had also used a photo of YouTube star Max Emerson's torso for the profile picture without permission, the Gay Times reported. Mr Emerson has spoken out on social media, saying he hopes Mr Hanouna ""learns a lesson"". Mr Hanouna's show has been the subject of complaints about sexism and homophobia before. In October a male guest on his show kissed a female guest on her breast after she rebuffed his requests for a kiss. That prompted more than 250 people, including then women's rights minister Laurence Rossignol, to complain to the regulator.",Tuesday 23 May 2017,23-May-17,French host humiliated gay men on TV,"Cyril Hanouna's ""homophobic"" prank prompts a record number of viewer complaints.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40002549
"Mexican Tarahumara woman wins 50km race wearing sandals A 22-year-old woman from Mexico's Tarahumara indigenous community has won a 50km (31 miles) ultramarathon wearing sandals. María Lorena Ramírez defeated 500 other runners from 12 countries in the female category of the Ultra Trail Cerro Rojo in Puebla, in central Mexico.  She ran without any professional gear, and her pair of sandals was reportedly made from recycled tyre rubber. The Tarahumara are famous for being excellent runners. The race was held on 29 April, but only now has word about her victory spread. Marathon runner Christopher McDougall wrote about the Tarahumara's ability to run extremely long distances in his book Born to Run. He found that the Tarahumara: Apart from the sandals, María Lorena Ramírez wore a skirt and a scarf in the race. She did not have any professional training. She finished the race in seven hours and three minutes, and was awarded 6,000 pesos ($320; £250). Reports said her job is herding goats and cattle, walking some 10-15km every day.

"Frozen 'space sperm' passes fertility test Healthy baby mice have been born using freeze-dried sperm stored in the near-weightless environment of space. The Japanese team behind the gravity-breaking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS) say it shows that transporting the seeds of life away from Earth is feasible.  Sperm banks could even be made on the Moon as a back-up for Earth disasters, they told a leading science journal. It is unclear if this will ever help humans populate space, however.  Sustaining life in space is challenging to say the least.  On the ISS, radiation is more than 100 times higher than on Earth. The average daily dose of 0.5mSv from the cosmic rays is enough to damage the DNA code inside living cells, including sperm.  Microgravity also does strange things to sperm.  In 1988, German researchers sent a sample of bull semen into orbit on a rocket and discovered that sperm were able to swim much faster in low gravity, although it was not clear whether this gave a fertility advantage.   Another space test showed fish eggs could be fertilised and develop normally during a 15-day orbital flight, suggesting a brief trip into space might not be too harmful for reproduction - at least for vertebrates.  The freeze-dried mouse sperm samples were stored on the space station for nine months before being sent back down to Earth and thawed at room temperature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports.  Although sperm DNA was slightly damaged by the trip, it still did the job of fertilising mouse eggs and creating apparently healthy ""space pups"".  Fertilisation and birth rates were similar to healthy ""ground control"" mice.  The space pups had only minor differences in their genetic code and grew to adulthood. A select few were allowed to mate and became mums and dads themselves.   The researchers, Sayaka Wakayama and colleagues from the University of Yamanashi, suspect some of the sperm DNA damage is repaired by the egg once it has been fertilised.  ""If sperm samples are to be preserved for longer periods in space, then it is likely that DNA damage will increase and exceed the limit of the [egg] oocyte's capacity for repair.  ""If the DNA damage occurring during long-term preservation is found to have a significant effect on offspring, we will need to develop methods to protect sperm samples against space radiation, such as an ice shield,"" they said.  Once they've cracked that, they can set their sights on the Moon sperm banks.  ""Underground storage on the Moon, such as in lava tubes, could be among the best places for prolonged or permanent sperm preservation because of their very low temperatures, protection from space radiation by thick bedrock layers, and complete isolation from any disasters on Earth,"" the scientists say.  But that still leaves the massive question of whether mammals, including us humans, can permanently live and procreate in space.  Mouse and human studies so far suggest perhaps not.  Prof Joseph Tash, a Nasa-supported physiologist at the University of Kansas Medical Center, said although the latest findings were interesting, the ISS was a somewhat sheltered environment to use as the test zone for space.  ""The ISS orbit is within the protection of the Van Allen radiation belt - the magnetic field that diverts most high energy radiation particles from hitting the earth or the ISS. He said the actual risk of radiation damage at the Moon and beyond would be much higher.  ""Ovaries and testes are the most sensitive organs to both acute and chronic radiation exposure.""  He said the feasibility of mammalian reproduction in space beyond the Van Allen belt would depend on the creation of ""radiation-hardened"" facilities that could protect sperm, eggs and embryos from harm. ""Given the nine month gestation for humans, the pregnant mother would also need to be protected by such a facility. So it presents very real habitat, medical, social, and psychological questions that need to be addressed as well.""

"Zimbabwe hunter 'crushed to death by shot elephant' A professional big-game hunter was crushed to death by an elephant that had been shot, according to reports in South Africa. The Netwerk24 website said an elephant cow stormed a group headed by Theunis Botha in Zimbabwe on Friday. The elephant was reportedly shot as she picked him up with her trunk, before she fell and died, crushing Mr Botha. He had been leading a group of hunters near the Hwange national park in Zimbabwe when he died. It is the same park where Cecil the Lion was shot dead by an American hunter in July 2015, sparking an international outcry. Mr Botha, 51, was a father of five from the northern Limpopo province in South Africa. His eldest daughter Marike confirmed her father's death to the BBC, but would not comment further on the circumstances of his death. Mr Botha's website says he began leading hunting safaris on private ranches in 1989, having previously served as a sergeant in the South African infantry. It said he specialised in hunting lions and leopards with dogs. His website lists various packages available to hunters in Zimbabwe, noting that animals including leopards, giraffes, buffalo and elephants could be hunted. A Facebook tribute by Zimbabwe-based Kuronda Safaris, which worked with Mr Botha, called him ""a great man with a fantastic sense of humour"". South African media reported that Mr Botha was friends with fellow hunter Scott Van Zyl, whose remains were found in a crocodile last month. Mr Van Zyl was killed on the banks of the Limpopo river in Zimbabwe in what was the latest in a series of fatal crocodile attacks in the country.",Tuesday 23 May 2017,23-May-17,Hunter 'fatally crushed by shot elephant',The elephant had reportedly picked up Theunis Botha with its trunk before being shot dead.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39996592
"Manchester attack: Three more arrests in bomber investigation Three more men have been arrested as police continue to investigate whether Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi acted alone. Abedi's 23-year-old brother has also been arrested. Abedi killed 22 and injured 64 when he blew himself up outside an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night. An off-duty policewoman is among the dead, the BBC understands. The UK terror threat level is now up to its highest level of ""critical"". This means more attacks may be imminent. Military personnel are being deployed to protect key sites. The Palace of Westminster has been closed to the public following police advice, and will not re-open until further notice, its website said. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""[Monday's attack] was more sophisticated than some of the attacks we've seen before, and it seems likely - possible - that he wasn't doing this on his own."" BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said that the bomber is thought to have been a ""mule"", using a device built by someone else. The victims include Nell Jones, 14, eight-year-old Saffie Roussos, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Jane Tweddle-Taylor, 50, Martyn Hett, 29, and Olivia Campbell, 15, . Kelly Brewster, 32, John Atkinson, 28, Georgina Callander - thought to be 18 - and Marcin and Angelika Klis, a Polish couple from York, have also been named. An off-duty police officer - who has not yet been named - was also among those killed, the BBC understands. Her husband is believed to be critically ill and their two children were also injured. Of the 64 injured, 20 are in a critical condition, and some have lost limbs. Twelve of them are known to be children. Several people are still missing, including Eilidh MacLeod, 14, from Barra in the Outer Hebrides, Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19. Eilidh's friend, Laura MacIntyre, 15, who was also reported as missing, was later identified as one of the seriously injured in a Manchester hospital. The police believe they have now identified all those killed and informed their families. They will formally name the victims after post-mortem examinations, a process likely to take four or five days. A hotline has been set up for people concerned about loved ones - 0800 096 0095. Prime Minister Theresa May said soldiers are being placed at Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, embassies and the Palace of Westminster to support armed police in protecting the public. Military personnel may also be seen at other events over the coming weeks, such as concerts, Mrs May said, working under the command of police officers. She said she did not want people to feel ""unduly alarmed"" but said it was a ""proportionate and sensible response"". Mrs Rudd said 984 troops had been deployed in the first instance. Up to 3,800 are available. She said she ""absolutely"" expected the raising of the threat level to critical to be temporary, adding that the bomber had been known ""up to a point"" by the intelligence services.  The highest threat level, which is decided by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre - a group of experts from the police, government departments and agencies - has only been reached twice before.  The first time the threat level was raised to critical was in 2006 during a major operation to stop a plot to blow up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs.  The following year, security chiefs raised it once more as they hunted for the men who had tried to bomb a London nightclub and attacked Glasgow Airport.  The Metropolitan Police says it has increased its presence across London.  Meanwhile, Chelsea Football Club have cancelled their Premier League victory parade, due to take place in London on Sunday, so as not to divert police resources. In Northern Ireland, extra police officers have also been deployed at key sites and on transport networks. Salman Abedi is understood to be a 22-year-old born in Manchester to parents of Libyan descent, and a former University of Salford student. He attended Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009-11.  Hamid El-Said, who worked for the UN on tackling radicalisation and who now works at the Manchester Metropolitan University, said Abedi had a ""really bad relationship"" with his family and his parents had tried but failed to keep him on the ""right path"". ""Eventually he was doing very bad at his university, at his education, and he didn't complete, and they tried to take him back to Libya several times. He had difficulties adjusting to European lifestyle,"" he added. A former classmate of Abedi's told the BBC that he was a ""very jokey lad"" but also ""very short tempered"" and would get angry at ""the littlest thing"". The man, who did not want to be identified, said Abedi was ""away at random times throughout the year"" but he did not know if he was abroad or playing truant because he hung around ""the wrong crowd and was very, very gullible"". ""You could tell him anything and he would pretty much fall for it."" He said that, before leaving the school in 2011, Abedi became ""more and more religious"" and that this might explain why he cut ties with former classmates. Apart from the three arrests in south Manchester on Wednesday, Abedi's older brother Ismael was arrested in Chorlton, south Manchester, on Tuesday in connection with the attack. On Wednesday afternoon, police raided a block of flats near Manchester Piccadilly station in the city centre, requiring them to briefly close the railway line. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, who is the national counter-terrorism policing lead, said the investigation was ""fast-moving and making good progress"". ""However, a critical line of inquiry is whether the dead terrorist was acting alone or part of a group,"" he said. ""We still have critical lines of inquiry they're chasing down which has led to a level of uncertainty."" Anyone with information about the attack can call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789321.

"Sir Roger Moore, James Bond actor, dies aged 89 Actor Sir Roger Moore, best known for playing James Bond, has died aged 89, his family has announced. He played the famous spy in seven Bond films including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill.  Sir Roger's family confirmed the news on Twitter, saying he had died after ""a short but brave battle with cancer"". The statement, from his children, read: ""Thank you Pops for being you, and being so very special to so many people."" ""With the heaviest of hearts, we must share the awful news that our father, Sir Roger Moore, passed away today. We are all devastated,"" they said in a Twitter post. The actor took the character of James Bond in a more humorous direction than his predecessor Sean Connery. Sir Roger's Bond was calm and suave - a smooth operator who could seemingly get himself out of a tricky situation with ease. The veteran star, who died in Switzerland, will have a private funeral in Monaco in accordance with his wishes, his children said. ""The love with which he was surrounded in his final days was so great it cannot be quantified in words alone,"" read the statement from Deborah, Geoffrey and Christian. ""Our thoughts must now turn to supporting Kristina [Tholstrup, his wife] at this difficult time."" The statement added: ""We know our own love and admiration will be magnified many times over, across the world, by people who knew him for his films, his television shows and his passionate work for UNICEF which he considered to be his greatest achievement. Along with his famous Bond role, Moore was also known for TV series The Persuaders and The Saint. Sir Roger was also well known for his humanitarian work - he was introduced to Unicef by the late Audrey Hepburn and was appointed as a goodwill ambassador in 1991.  Russell Crowe led the tributes to the actor on Twitter, writing simply: ""Roger Moore, loved him."" Michael Caine said: ""I am truly sad and think I will be in tears if I talk about him. ""Roger was the perfect gentlemen, adored by all his friends."" Michael Ball said: ""My dearest uncle Roger has passed on. What a sad, sad day this is. ""Loved the bones of him. Generous, funny, beautiful and kind."" Mia Farrow wrote: ""Few are as kind & giving as was Roger Moore. Loving thoughts with his family & friends,"" while Boy George added: ""RIP Sir Roger Moore. He was the king of cool."" Duran Duran, who sang the Bond theme song for A View To A Kill, simply tweeted: RIP Roger. In a statement, fellow Unicef ambassador and actor Ewan McGregor said: ""Thank you, Roger, for having championed so tirelessly the rights of all children for the last 26 years. ""You've shown that we all have the power to make a change to the lives of the most vulnerable children."" Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent, recalled how he and Sir Roger had become good friends in recent years. ""He even watched me ski past his chalet in Crans-Montana [Switzerland] while sipping a drink on his balcony,"" he said.  ""He had a wonderful sense of humour and I will miss his jokes by email.

"Ex-CIA chief Brennan says Trump-Russia inquiry 'well-founded' Former CIA Director John Brennan has said an investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Kremlin is ""well-founded"". He told the House Intelligence Committee he was aware of intelligence showing contact between Russian officials and ""US persons involved in the Trump campaign"". Mr Brennan said the Russians ""brazenly interfered"" in last November's US elections and were ""very aggressive"". But he said he did not know if the Trump campaign intrigued with Moscow.  Mr Brennan, who stepped down as CIA director in January, testified on Tuesday: ""I encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and US persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals.  ""It raised questions in my mind whether or not Russia was able to gain the co-operation of those individuals."" Trump-Russia scandal: How did we get here? Trump trip memorable moments His evidence undercuts President Donald Trump's claim that the investigation is a ""taxpayer funded charade"". The White House said Mr Brennan's testimony ""backs up what we've been saying all along"". ""There is still no evidence of any Russia-Trump campaign collusion,"" the administration said in a statement. The House inquiry is one of two congressional investigations into claims that Russian hackers tried to tip the presidential election in Mr Trump's favour last November, and whether members of his campaign aided the alleged Kremlin conspiracy.  The FBI also has its own investigation on the issue.  Mr Brennan added that he left office with many unanswered questions about Russia's influence over the election, but that the FBI's probe ""was certainly well-founded and needed to look into these issues"". Mr Brennan also told lawmakers that he had warned his Russian counterpart, FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov, during a phone call last August against meddling.   He told Mr Bortnikov any attempt to interfere would ""destroy any near-term prospect"" of repairing relations between Washington and Moscow.  Mr Bortnikov twice denied interfering and promised to bring up the matter with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Mr Brennan.  As CIA Director, Mr Brennan, along with the FBI and the Office of Director of National Intelligence, released an intelligence report in January concluding that Moscow attempted to influence the outcome of the election.  Days afterwards, Mr Trump strained relations with the intelligence community when he accused spy officials of leaking allegations that Russia had compromising information on him, likening it to ""Nazi Germany"". At the time, Mr Brennan called Mr Trump's accusations ""outrageous"".  In a separate congressional hearing on Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats declined to comment on a report that Mr Trump asked him to publicly deny there was any evidence of collusion between his campaign and Moscow. According to the Washington Post, Mr Coats and Admiral Mike Rogers, director of the National Security Agency, rejected Mr Trump's alleged request. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee announced plans to issue two new subpoenas - legal summons - to businesses owned by Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's fired national security adviser, who left after misleading the White House about his Russian contacts.

"Philippines President Duterte declares martial law on Mindanao island Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has declared martial law for 60 days on the island of Mindanao, after clashes between the army and militants linked to so-called Islamic State (IS). The violence on the southern island left three members of the security forces dead, officials say. Mindanao is home to a number of Muslim rebel groups seeking more autonomy. Mr Duterte made the announcement during a visit to Russia, which he was forced to cut short. Martial law allows the use of the military to enforce law and the detention of people without charge for long periods. During his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Duterte also said the Philippines needed more modern weapons to fight IS militants and other militant groups. The violence in Marawi, a city of about 200,000 people in Mindanao, erupted on Tuesday as the army searched for the leader of a militant group that had pledged allegiance to IS, the military said. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana identified the militants as members of the Maute group. They had occupied a hospital and a jail, and burnt down buildings including a church, he added.  Marawi is about 800km (500 miles) south of the capital Manila. The Philippine constitution says a president can only declare martial law for 60 days to stop an invasion or a rebellion.

"Trump's $4.1tr budget takes hatchet to safety net The White House has unveiled a $4.1tr (£3.1tr) budget that would take the axe to the social safety net for the poor. The plan would sharply slash food stamps, healthcare for low-income patients and disability benefits, and eliminate student loan subsidies. The budget also features an Ivanka Trump plan for paid parental leave. The US military would receive a 10% boost while $1.6bn would be allocated for a wall on the border with Mexico. President Trump, who is travelling overseas, missed the unveiling of his first full budget, titled A New Foundation for American Greatness.  Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, told reporters on Tuesday the proposal is ""simply the president's priorities put on paper"". No. A US president's annual budget is a policy wish list that stands little chance of being enacted. The Senate and House of Representatives will pass their own versions, which will then go to congressional committees before the final spending plan is cemented. The Trump budget might have expected a sympathetic reading in the Republican-controlled Congress. But even fiscally hawkish conservatives are baulking at some of the $3.6tr in cuts. Critics say the plan would hurt some of Mr Trump's supporters hardest. The White House budget director said: ""Yes, you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving federal funds, but you also have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it."" The US is the only developed country that does not grant new mothers or fathers a single day of paid time off.  But the US first daughter, who also acts as assistant to the president, has championed a policy to change all that. Ivanka Trump's $19bn plan to offer six weeks of paid leave to mothers and fathers makes this the first Republican administration to put forth such a proposal. But congressional Republicans are unlikely to rubber-stamp a new government mandate. And even Democrats, who have long cried out for such a benefit, may be reluctant to lend their support to this president. Ivanka Trump: US first daughter This proposed budget should be seen as a presidential statement of principles - and those principles often run counter to the ones Mr Trump campaigned on last year. The defence spending boost is there, yes, but funds allocated for a border wall aren't nearly enough to realise Mr Trump's dream. Infrastructure spending is below the massive investment Mr Trump promised. Candidate Trump also pledged to protect entitlement spending, but his budget makes massive cuts in the Medicaid healthcare programme for the poor.  There was always going to be some conflict between Mr Trump's campaign guarantees and reality, but this budget more closely resembles the agenda of the most aggressive Republican fiscal hawks.  The budget will have some support in Congress from hardliners, but it would have been difficult to imagine during the heat of the campaign that President Trump would start so far to the right.   This budget projects the US government will eliminate its deficit and be running a surplus by 2027 - for the first time since the 1990s. The plan promises to cut tax rates, relying largely on hoped-for economic growth of 3% to avoid adding to the deficit.  But that forecast is well beyond the independent Congressional Budget Office assumptions of 1.9% growth. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan policy body, said the Trump budget is based on ""rosy assumptions"" and ""does not add up"". The White House budget director said on Tuesday 3% growth ""will be the new normal for this country"", but conceded that without it, the ""budget will never balance"". Democrats are predictably outraged. Hillary Clinton said the Trump budget shows an ""unimaginable level of cruelty"" for millions of Americans and children.  Yet even conservatives are voicing anxiety about the magnitude of the cuts. Mark Walker, chairman of the spending hawks in the Republican Study Committee, told the Washington Post: ""There will be some concern if we go too deep in some of these areas."" Mark Meadows, chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, told the New York Times: ""Meals on Wheels, even for some of us who are considered to be fiscal hawks, may be a bridge too far.""  John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the Senate, said the plan was ""dead on arrival"".",Wednesday 24 May 2017,24-May-17,Trump budget takes hatchet to safety net,"The White House says it is a ""taxpayer first"" plan, but even hardline conservatives have qualms.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40015958
"Romania criticised over domestic violence 'failures' Romania has been criticised over its lack of commitment to tackling domestic violence in a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. The court fined the country after it failed to hold to account a man who attacked his wife eight times. Officials went so far as to accuse the victim, Angelica Balșan, of provoking the assaults, the court noted. Official statistics suggest most Romanians think domestic violence is normal, it said. In certain circumstances, 60% of Romanians see it as justified, it said. Such attitudes, which were even more deeply entrenched during the period of communist rule, are slowly beginning to shift and the government has adopted new laws to combat such abuse. But ""the overall unresponsiveness of the judicial system and the impunity enjoyed by aggressors, as found in Ms Balșan's case, indicated that there had been insufficient commitment"" to enforcing them, the court noted. It found Romania had violated articles of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibiting inhuman and degrading treatment and discrimination based on gender. Angelica Balșan married her husband in 1979 and told the court her husband had been violent to her and their four children throughout their marriage.  But the violence intensified during their divorce proceedings in 2007, she testified. She sustained injuries that required between two and 10 days' medical care. She requested protection through emergency calls, petitions to the head of police and criminal complaints, saying she feared for her life. In some cases authorities decided not to press charges in the belief that she had provoked the attacks. In other cases her husband was acquitted in court. Finding against Romania, the court ordered it pay Ms Balșan €9,800 (£8,480; $11,000) in damages. The verdict can be challenged and referred to the Court's Grand Chamber.

Speaking at the University of Maryland, Yang Shuping drew a parallel between air pollution in China and the country's restrictions on free speech. Angry Chinese social media users accused her of denigrating her homeland and told her to stay in the US. But the university backed her, saying it was vital to hear different views. Ms Yang - who was selected by the university to speak - contrasted wearing a face mask against pollution with the ""sweet and fresh"" air in the US.

Her speech became one of the hottest topics on the internet in China, with posts about it having been viewed more than 50m times by Tuesday. Many Chinese social media users were angry, including fellow Chinese students at the University of Maryland who made their own YouTube video in which they accused Ms Yang of ""false statements"". One of the students, Xinliang Jiang, said China was ""still improving"" and ""needed to embrace suggestions from the outside world"" but said Ms Yang's speech amounted to ""deceptions and lies"". The city authorities in her home city of Kunming in southwestern China also weighed in, saying air quality had been good almost every day so far this year and adding: ""In Kunming, air is very likely to be 'sweet and fresh'."" The People's Daily newspaper meanwhile accused her of making a ""biased"" speech. Faced with mounting uproar, Ms Yang issued a statement on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo, saying she was ""surprised and disturbed"" by the reaction to her speech and ""deeply loved"" her motherland. ""I apologise and sincerely hope everyone can forgive me. I have learned my lesson,"" she wrote. She was nevertheless backed by her university, which said in a statement: ""Listening to and respectfully engaging with those whom we disagree are essential skills, both within university walls and beyond"". Some Weibo users agreed.

"Fox retracts Seth Rich murder conspiracy Fox News has retracted a report about a US Democratic party employee whose murder last year has fuelled a right-wing conspiracy theory. The cable network's report made an unsubstantiated link between Seth Rich's death and Wikileaks' leak of hacked DNC emails.  The victim's own family have debunked the report, imploring Fox News to stop reporting it.  Mr Rich, 27, was shot dead in Washington DC, last year. Police say evidence suggests the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) staff member was the victim of a botched robbery. No arrest has been made. On Tuesday, Fox deleted its story, but said it would continue investigating his death. ""On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich,"" the network said in a statement. ""The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting.  ""Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed."" Mr Rich was shot in the back on 10 July last year in the north-west of the city at the Bloomingdale neighbourhood, where residents have reported a spate of gunpoint robberies. Following his death, some right-wing media suggested his killing was revenge by figures linked to the Hillary Clinton campaign for allegedly leaking embarrassing DNC emails to Wikileaks. Wikileaks itself fuelled the conspiracy theory by offering a reward for the capture of Mr Rich's killer and hinting that he may have been the source of the emails.  No evidence has emerged to indicate that Mr Rich provided the emails to the anti-secrecy organisation. Fox News this month published and aired reports on Washington affiliate WTTG-TV, citing Rod Wheeler, a contributor to the cable network and private investigator, who said he was being paid by the Rich family to look into the murder.  He said evidence showed Mr Rich was in contact with Wikileaks before his death.  The Rich family rejected his claim and released a statement through a spokesman saying: ""Anyone who continues to push this fake news story after it was so thoroughly debunked is proving to the world they have a transparent political agenda or are a sociopath."" WTTG-TV later retracted the report, acknowledging Mr Wheeler had no evidence to support the claim. However, the story initially remained on Fox's website.  Mr Wheeler told CNN the source for his assertion was a reporter at Fox News.  The Rich family sent Mr Wheeler a cease-and-desist letter and threatened legal action if he continued to discuss the case.  But Fox News host Sean Hannity continued to fan the conspiracy theory on his show, prompting the family to write a letter urging the programme to stop disseminating the claims.  Mr Hannity defended his decision to continue promoting the story on Twitter on Tuesday, suggesting an online entrepreneur, Kim Dotcom, can back up the claim.  Mr Dotcom, who is currently fighting extradition to the US from New Zealand on copyright infringement and money laundering charges, said he has evidence to support the conspiracy theory.  Brad Bauman, a spokesman for the Rich family, told CNN they were grateful for the retraction.  ""The family would like to thank Fox News for their retraction on a story that has caused deep pain and anguish to the family and has done harm to Seth Rich's legacy,"" he said.  ""We are hopeful that in the future Fox News will work with the family to ensure the highest degree of professionally and scrutiny is followed so that only accurate facts are reported serving this case.""",Wednesday 24 May 2017,24-May-17,Fox retracts Clinton murder conspiracy,"The victim's family said those pushing the report have ""a transparent political agenda or are a sociopath"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40021373
"German schools get tough Prince Harry English exam changed German officials are changing a school English exam which many students and teachers deemed too difficult - partly because it included a poor recording of Prince Harry ""mumbling"" in a speech. The decision in the most populous state - North Rhine-Westphalia - came after an online student petition collected more than 43,000 signatures. Students also complained about a question on Apartheid in South Africa, which had difficult vocabulary. For many it was a very important exam. It was part of the state's middle-school leaving exams, taken by 16-year-olds, and counted for half of all the marks in English. The marks obtained in those exams usually determine what sort of apprenticeship students can do after secondary school.  In light of the complaints, the English exam marks are being revised. Different leaving exams, called the ""Abitur"", are taken by students at Gymnasien - schools more geared towards higher education. Dario Schramm, 16, launched the online petition on Thursday, and it quickly drew thousands of signatures, German media reported. Commenting on the Prince Harry speech, he complained that there was ""loud background noise"". The prince gave the speech on Aids at a children's centre in Lesotho in 2015.

"Trump 'to do everything' for Middle East peace US President Donald Trump has said he will ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. At talks with Mahmoud Abbas, he spoke of being gratified that the Palestinian leader had committed to taking necessary steps to ""fight terrorism"". Israel and the Palestinians have not held peace talks for three years and Mr Trump acknowledges it would be ""one of the toughest deals of all"" to broker.  This is the last day of the US president's visit to the Middle East. In both the occupied West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians have held protests against the trip and in support of a hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. On Monday, Mr Trump said he had come to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region. He flew to Tel Aviv direct from Saudi Arabia, where at a summit on Sunday he urged Arab and Muslim leaders to work together to ""drive out"" Islamist extremists. Mr Trump said he had come to Bethlehem, where the meeting with Mr Abbas was held on Tuesday morning, ""in a spirit of hope"". ""I am committed to trying to achieve a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians,"" he said. ""And I intend to do everything I can to help them achieve that goal. He added the president of the Palestinian Authority had assured him he was ""ready to work towards that goal in good faith"", and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised the same.  Mr Trump also said that he was ""gratified"" that Mr Abbas had attended the summit in Riyadh and ""committed to taking firm but necessary steps to fight terrorism and confront its hateful ideology"". ""Peace can never take root in an environment where violence is tolerated, funded and even rewarded,"" he added, apparently referring to payments made by the PA to the families of Palestinian prisoners and those killed in the conflict with Israel.  Mr Abbas welcomed Mr Trump's ""noble and possible mission"". ""I would like to reiterate our commitment to co-operate with you in order to make peace and forge an historic peace deal with the Israelis,"" he said. The US president began his statement with a condemnation of Monday evening's suicide bomb attack at a concert in Manchester. ""So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life,"" he said. Later on Tuesday Mr Trump returned to Jerusalem, visiting the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. And in a speech later at the Israel Museum, he reaffirmed that his administration would always stand with Israel. But he said his trip was ""focused on bringing nations together"", adding that the Palestinians were ""ready to reach for peace"". President Trump sees himself as a great dealmaker, with the personality to cut through the difficulties that have defeated lesser people. The only credible ideas still require the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel. The reality is that the Israelis and Palestinians are way apart on the main issues - the future of east Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the borders of an independent Palestine. The two sets of leaders also do not trust each other. The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, has been occupied by Israel for 50 years. Some of the most influential members of the Israeli government believe the land is a Jewish possession, given by God. The Palestinians are deeply divided, with Fatah in charge in the West Bank and in Gaza the Islamists of Hamas, who have been condemned by President Trump in the last few days as terrorists. It is highly unlikely that even President Trump's outsized personality will be enough, on its own, to end a conflict that has lasted more than a century.  Making this deal is not about fixing a price - it is about reconciling enemies with radically different world views. On Monday Palestinians gathered at military checkpoints around the West Bank to protest against Mr Trump's visit, and over conditions in Israeli prisons. Hundreds of stone-throwing youths clashed with Israeli soldiers firing tear gas and rubber bullets. At least one person was injured at the Qalandia checkpoint near Jerusalem. In the Gaza Strip, other Palestinians trampled photos of the US leader and, according to Reuters news agency, burnt an effigy of him.  A ""day of rage"" has been called for Tuesday by the Palestinian prisoners' committee. Hundreds of jailed Palestinians have been on hunger strike since 17 April. Activists were hoping to hold up protest banners in Bethlehem on Tuesday to make Mr Trump aware of the action. Speaking in Jerusalem on Monday, he promised that Iran would never have nuclear weapons and accused it of supporting ""terrorists"". ""Iran will never have nuclear weapons, that I can tell you,"" Mr Trump told Mr Netanyahu.  In return, Mr Netanyahu extolled the US president's leadership. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani played down Mr Trump's strong criticism of Iran at a summit in Saudi Arabia at the weekend, saying: ""Who can say regional stability can be restored without Iran?"" His first foreign trip as US president has been overshadowed by political difficulties at home. Speaking to Mr Netanyahu on Monday, he sought to dispel suggestions that he had passed on sensitive Israeli intelligence to Russian diplomats at a recent meeting, saying he had not mentioned the word ""Israel"" at the meeting.   Mr Trump has now flown to Rome ahead of a meeting with Pope Francis. On Wednesday he will continue to Brussels to see Nato leaders.

"South Korea fires at North 'object' South Korea says it has fired warning shots at an object that flew across the demilitarised zone from North Korea.  About 90 machine gun rounds were fired at the object, which has not been identified. North Korea has flown drones over the border in the past.  In a statement, the South Korean military said it was ""maintaining high vigilance"".  The incident comes amid continuing high tension on the Korean peninsula.  On Sunday Pyongyang conducted what it said was a successful test of a medium-range ballistic missile.   That test came a week after North Korea tested what it said was a new type of rocket capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead. The pace of North Korean missile tests has increased in recent months and experts fear it indicates progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile that could strike the continental US.  The UN Security Council is to hold a closed-door meeting on North Korea on Tuesday evening. In a statement on Monday, it agreed to ""take further significant measures including sanctions"" to force North Korea to end its ""highly destabilising behaviour"". The spike in tensions comes with a new president in South Korea. Moon Jae-in was sworn into office earlier this month after the previous leader, Park Geun-hye, was impeached. She is now on trial for corruption.  Mr Moon has adopted a more conciliatory stance than his predecessor, calling for more dialogue with the North.  South Korean military officials did not say whether they hit or secured the object that flew across the demilitarised zone, but similar incidents have occurred in the past.  In January 2016, South Korean border troops fired shots at a suspected drone.  In 2014, South Korean officials said they found two North Korean drones, one south of the demilitarised zone near Paju and the other on an island near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border.

"Bahrain protester 'killed in raid on sit-in' near Shia cleric's home A protester has been killed in a raid by Bahraini police on a sit-in near the home of the Sunni-ruled kingdom's most prominent Shia cleric, activists say. Witnesses said officers had opened fire as they moved into the village of Diraz, where Sheikh Isa Qassim lives. The interior ministry said a number of ""fugitives"" had been arrested, but did not comment on the reported death. The raid comes two days after Sheikh Qassim was given a one-year suspended jail sentence for alleged corruption. The cleric - who holds the religious rank of ayatollah - was also fined 100,000 Bahraini dinars ($265,000; £204,000) after being found guilty by a court of collecting funds illegally and money laundering. Last June, Bahrain stripped Sheikh Qassim of his citizenship, accusing him of using his position to promote violence. The decision left him stateless and at risk of deportation, prompting supporters to stage a sit-in outside his home. Police responded by surrounding Diraz and restricting access in recent months. Bahrain civilians to face military trials What lies behind Bahrain crackdown? On Tuesday, the interior ministry announced that a security operation had begun in Diraz to ""maintain order and remove violations punishable under law that hinder the movement of citizens"". The sit-in had been ""turned into a meeting ground for suspects wanted in security-related cases and fugitives"", state media cited the ministry as saying.  Witnesses told AFP news agency that the raid triggered clashes, with officers opening fire at demonstrators throwing stones and Molotov cocktails. The UK-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said one protester was killed and identified him as environmental activist Mohammed Khadim Zain al-Din.  The pro-opposition Bahrain Mirror reported that Mr Zain al-Din had suffered gunshot wounds and posted a photograph showing the body of a man covered in blood.  Human Rights Watch condemned the raid. ""The timing of this operation - two days after King Hamad's convivial meeting with President Trump - can hardly be a coincidence,"" the US-based group said in a statement. At a summit in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, Mr Trump told King Hamad said US relations with Bahrain would not be put under ""strain"" as they were during the Obama administration, which criticised the kingdom's human rights record. Bahrain has been wracked by unrest since security forces crushed pro-democracy protests mainly led by Shia during the Arab Spring in 2011. The authorities have launched a wider crackdown on dissent over the past year that has included banning the main Shia political grouping, Wefaq, which was accused of fomenting sectarian unrest, and jailing its leader Sheikh Ali Salman. Wefaq helped lead the protests six years ago, which demanded greater political rights and an end to discrimination against Shia by the Sunni monarchy. The following month, King Hamad brought in troops from neighbouring Sunni-led Gulf states to end the demonstrations and restore order. The unrest left at least 30 civilians and five policemen dead. Activists say dozens of people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces since then, while bomb attacks blamed on Iran-backed militants have killed a number of policemen.",Wednesday 24 May 2017,24-May-17,Bahraini man 'killed in raid on sit-in',"Activists say one protester has been killed in Diraz, home of the Gulf state's leading Shia cleric.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40011837
"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: Ethiopian wins top WHO job Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus from Ethiopia will be the next director general of the World Health Organization (WHO).  He will be the first African to head up the UN agency, after winning the most votes from 186 member states.  He replaces Margaret Chan, who will step down from her 10-year post at the end of June.  During her tenure, the WHO's response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was criticised for being too slow. The agency was accused of missing key warning signs about the severity of the outbreak that began in December 2013 and ultimately killed more than 11,000 people.  Addressing the World Health Assembly shortly before the vote, Dr Tedros promised to respond to future emergencies ""rapidly and effectively"".  He also promised to stand up for the rights of the poor.  ""All roads should lead to universal health coverage. I will not rest until we have met this."" Age: 52 Family life: Married, with five children and lives in Ethiopia Previous jobs: Ethiopian minister of health and foreign affairs, chairman of the board of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria Qualifications: Internationally recognised malaria researcher, with a PhD in community health His election was not without controversy.  He has recently been accused of covering up three cholera epidemics in Ethiopia, but his supports say this is untrue.  Ethiopian opposition groups are also critical of Dr Tedros. They accuse the government of human rights abuses and believe that Dr Tedros' candidacy is an attempt to raise the country's diplomatic profile. Dr Tedros said his vision as the new director general was of ""a world in which everyone can lead health and productive lives, regardless of who they are or where they live"". He told delegates at the World General Assembly: ""I promise I will get up every day, determined to make a difference... I am ready to serve."" His top five priorities in his new job are: Although some people see Dr Tedros as a controversial pick, many others point to his impressive CV and track record, and insist he is the best person to lead the world's ""guardian of global health"".  As well as serving as Ethiopia's foreign affairs and health ministers, he's also chaired the Global Fund, which mobilizes and invests about $4bn a year to fight Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.  During the election campaign, Dr Tedros told me about the deep injustice he felt as a child when his five-year-old brother died of what he now believes was measles. He said the disparity of care between the developed and developing world continues to be utterly unacceptable.  Dr Tedros says universal healthcare - where everyone has access to affordable care when and where they need it - will be central to his presidency.  This is indeed the holy grail of global health, and Dr Tedros is now the man in charge of pressing governments to make it happen.

"Manchester attack: Police hunt 'network' behind bomber A seventh person has been arrested in the UK over the Manchester Arena bombing, as police said they were investigating a ""network"". Police said they arrested the man in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, following searches. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 - including children - and injured 64 at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday. The bomber's father, Ramadan, and younger brother, Hashem, have been detained by militia in Libya. His older brother, Ismail, was detained in Chorlton, south Manchester, on Tuesday. The fifth UK arrest on Wednesday - in Wigan - involved a man who was carrying a package that is now being ""assessed"", police said. Eyewitness Connor Britton told the BBC the man had been held by ""undercover armed police"". He said workers in his office had been told to stay inside and lock their windows, and that a red package had been ""moved to a clear part of the street"". The UK terror threat level is now at its highest level of ""critical"", meaning more attacks may be imminent. Military personnel are being deployed to protect key sites after the UK's terror threat level was raised on Tuesday night. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""[Monday's attack] was more sophisticated than some of the attacks we've seen before, and it seems likely - possible - that [Abedi]  wasn't doing this on his own."" Meanwhile, the New York Times has obtained photos which it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a ""possible detonator"".  The paper says the alleged evidence suggests ""a powerful, high-velocity charge, and a bomb in which its shrapnel was carefully and evenly packed"". UK authorities have reacted with anger to the publication of the leaked pictures. One Whitehall source told the BBC there was ""disbelief and astonishment"" across Whitehall. A counter terrorism policing spokesperson said it was a breach of trust that undermined relationships with ""trusted intelligence, law enforcement and security partners around the world"" and undermined the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families. ""This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorised disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counter terrorism investigation,"" the spokesperson added. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said that the bomber is thought to have been a ""mule"", using a device built by someone else. In other developments: Seven people were arrested in the UK since Monday night, including Abedi's older brother Ismail, 23. He has since been released without charge. Younger brother Hashem, 20, was held by militia in the Libyan capital Tripoli, as was their father. Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I think it's very clear that this is a network that we are investigating. ""And as I've said, it continues at a pace. There's extensive investigations going on and activity taking place across Greater Manchester, as we speak."" As part of their investigation, police raided a block of flats near Manchester Piccadilly station in the city centre, requiring them to carry out a controlled explosion and briefly close the railway line. Police carried out another controlled explosion in the early hours of Thursday morning at an address in the Moss Side area of Manchester. Anyone with information about the attack can call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789321. The victims include 14-year-old Sorrell Leczkowski, from Leeds, whose grandmother is critically injured in hospital. Others who died are mother-of-three Michelle Kiss, Nell Jones, 14, eight-year-old Saffie Roussos, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Jane Tweddle-Taylor, 51, Martyn Hett, 29, and Olivia Campbell, 15. Kelly Brewster, 32, John Atkinson, 28, Georgina Callander - thought to be 18 - and Marcin and Angelika Klis, a Polish couple from York, have also been named. South Shields couple Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19 have been named among the dead. Family members paid tribute to the teenagers and in a statement issued by police said: ""They wanted to be together forever and now they are"". Some of the victims had been making their way outside at the end of the gig when Abedi detonated his ""nuts-and-bolts"" bomb.  Others had been waiting in the foyer to pick up children and family. A serving Cheshire police officer - off-duty at the time - was also among those killed. She has not yet been named. The BBC understands her partner is critically ill and his two children were injured. Of the 64 injured, 20 are in a critical condition. Twelve of them are children. Mr Hopkins said the families of all those injured had been contacted. Salman Abedi is understood to have been a 22-year-old born in Manchester to Libyan parents, and a former University of Salford student. He attended Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009 and 2011, and The Manchester College until 2013.  Hamid El-Said, who worked for the UN on tackling radicalisation and now works at Manchester Metropolitan University, said Abedi had had a ""really bad relationship"" with his family and his parents had tried but failed to keep him on the ""right path"". ""Eventually he was doing very bad at his university, at his education, and he didn't complete, and they tried to take him back to Libya several times. He had difficulties adjusting to European lifestyle,"" he said. A former classmate of Abedi's told the BBC that he was a ""very jokey lad"" but also ""very short tempered"" and would get angry at ""the littlest thing"". The man, who did not want to be identified, said Abedi had hung around ""the wrong crowd and was very, very gullible"". Before leaving Burnage Academy in 2011, Abedi had become ""more and more religious"", the man added. A Muslim community worker, who did not want to be identified, has told the BBC that two people who had known Abedi at college had made separate calls to a hotline to warn the police about his extremist views. He said they had been worried that Abedi was ""supporting terrorism"" and he had expressed the view that ""being a suicide bomber was ok"".  The calls are thought to have been made five years ago, he added. Prime Minister Theresa May said soldiers are being placed at Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, embassies and the Palace of Westminster to support armed police in protecting the public. Military personnel may also be seen at other events over the coming weeks, such as concerts, Mrs May said, in what she is calling a ""proportionate and sensible response"". Home Secretary Amber Rudd said 984 troops had been deployed in the first instance. Up to 3,800 are available. She said she expected the raising of the threat level to critical to be temporary, adding that the bomber had been known ""up to a point"" by the intelligence services.  The highest threat level has been reached only twice before: in 2006 during an operation to stop a plot to blow up transatlantic airliners, and a year later when security chiefs were hunting for the men who tried to bomb a London nightclub and attacked Glasgow Airport.  The Metropolitan Police says it has increased its presence across London, and freed up an extra 1,000 armed officers to patrol crowded places, key sites and transport hubs across the UK.

By Megan Fisher and Paul Gribben All times stated are UK As the UK terror threat level is raised to its highest level, we ask what does that mean? Police have arrested a man in the Moss Side area of Manchester in connection with Monday's attack.  Eight men remain in custody as part of the investigation, Greater Manchester Police say. The Question Time debate turns to the leaking of details of the Manchester investigation - including photos from the scene - to the US media. Amber Rudd says Theresa May has raised the matter with US President Donald Trump, and that she does not think the leaks have damaged the investigation. The home secretary, who has previously expressed her irritation at the reports appearing in the US media, adds: ""It must have been such a terrible thing for the families to see."" Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham says what has happened is ""absolutely outrageous"". ""It's wrong, it's arrogant of the Americans and it's disrespectful to the people of Greater Manchester and most importantly the families of those who have died."" ""I'm a proud Manc and a proud Muslim"", says a man in the Question Time audience. ""What happened on Monday night was an evil act and abhorrent act,"" he says. He warns that Muslims can be ""collateral"" damage after a terror attack if Islamophobia increases. Let's not be divided, he says. The home secretary rejects criticism of cuts to police budgets, which some warn have affected on-the-ground intelligence about possible extremism. ""We must not imply that this terrorist activity would not have taken place if there were more police,"" she says, on Question Time. Good counter-terrorism policy relies on strong relationships between the police and the intelligence services, she says: ""It's not about those pure numbers on the street."" She adds: ""It's not about policing, so much as engaging with community leaders in the area."" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham says the prime minister and home secretary have taken decisive action and should be commended. He goes on to praise the reaction of the city in coming together and the response of the emergency services, following Monday's attack. ""This is the greatest city in the world and I couldn't be more proud of it,"" he adds. Question Time is up and running in Salford, Greater Manchester.  A man in the audience says, as a father of two young girls, he finds it hard coming to terms with the Manchester suicide bomb attack. Amber Rudd says she does too, and that the important thing is to let the investigation take place. Nazir Afzal, the chairman of the Police and Crime Commissioners Association, says a conversation is also needed about ""deradicalisation"" and engaging communities. Gabriel Gatehouse tells the BBC's Newsnight that Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi and his father, who has been detained by militia in Libya, fought against Colonel Gaddafi as part of a campaign to topple his regime.

"Republican health bill to leave 23m uninsured Some 23 million people would lose health insurance over the next decade under the revised Republican healthcare plan, says a non-partisan agency. Fourteen million people would be uninsured in 2018 alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  The analysis said federal deficits would fall by $119bn (£91bn) from 2017-2026 under the proposal, which is championed by President Donald Trump.  House Republicans were criticised for passing the bill before the assessment. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Trump health bill: Winners and losers Wednesday's rating lays down the gauntlet to Republican senators who are now crafting their own version of the bill, which Democrats have labelled ""Trumpcare"". House Republicans amended their American Health Care Act (AHCA) after it failed back in March to attract enough support to even win a vote in a chamber their party controls.  The bill would accomplish a long-running conservative goal of repealing and replacing former President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The CBO score predicts the revised AHCA would leave 1 million fewer Americans uninsured overall compared with the last version, which said 24 million would lose coverage. The $119bn projected to be shaved off the federal deficit is less than the $150bn in savings forecast in the previous version of the bill. The CBO scoring of the healthcare reform plan approved by the House of Representatives landed with a sodden thud in Washington on Wednesday evening. Now Senate Republicans are left with an unpleasant mess to clean up.  If the analysis of the original bill was bad, the changes House leadership implemented to make the legislation palatable to a majority of their chamber have only made things worse.  The House bill hasn't even been formally handed over to the Senate yet, but when it is it won't just be dead on arrival, rigor mortis will have set in. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell will essentially have to start from scratch in coming up with a reform plan that can pass his chamber. Given that different Republicans want different things out of the legislation - some want to preserve Medicaid healthcare for the poor, others want complete repeal of Obamacare - it will be a Herculean task. The Senate will be pressed to come up with something, however, and success isn't inconceivable. Then the challenge becomes finding common ground with the House and squeezing the compromise legislation through. That's the highest bar of all - one that looks set at the top of a political Mount Everest. The findings place a big question mark over whether Republicans will be able to muster enough support to send a bill to the president's desk. ""I don't know how we get to 50 [votes] at the moment,"" Senate leader Mitch McConnell told Reuters news agency on Wednesday. ""But that's the goal."" Obamacare has been rocked by insurers leaving the online marketplaces that sell medical insurance, and Blue Cross Blue Shield announced on Wednesday it would be the latest company to withdraw from the exchanges, in Missouri and Kansas. The insurer said it had lost more than $100m. The Republican legislation would eliminate most Obamacare taxes that help subsidise private health coverage for individuals. It would also impose deep cuts on the government's Medicaid health plan for the poor and disabled. Many of the 20 million Americans who gained coverage under Obamacare did so through the expansion of Medicaid. Republicans say the AHCA aims to fix the rising premiums that many Americans complained about under Obamacare, and which have long been a problem in the US healthcare system.  The revised bill would provide $8bn over five years to help sick people, including those with cancer, pay for coverage. But many health policy experts say the amount is far from enough to cover the cost. Democrats quickly denounced the score, with Senator Bernie Sanders calling it a ""disgrace"".  ""A 'health care' plan does not throw 23 million people off of health care. That's a 'destroy health care' plan,"" he tweeted. Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the score shows ""unless you're a healthy millionaire"", the AHCA would be a ""nightmare"".  ""This report ought to be the final nail in the coffin of the Republican effort to sabotage our healthcare system,"" he said.  Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin said in a statement: ""No wonder the Republicans were afraid of the CBO analysis."" ""Trumpcare 2.0 will still force millions of Americans to lose their health insurance, raise premiums, and put critical health care services beyond the reach of hard-working families,"" the Illinois senator said.  ""All of this to give a GOP tax cut to the wealthiest.""",Thursday 25 May 2017,25-May-17,Trump health bill to leave 23m uninsured,House Republicans were excoriated for passing the bill before the Congressional Budget Office score.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40032893
"Trump 'determined to pursue peace' after Pope meeting US President Donald Trump has said he is ""more determined than ever"" to pursue peace in the world after meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican. He was granted a short private audience with the head of the Catholic Church on the latest leg of his overseas trip. The two men have in the past clashed on issues such as migration, climate change and a Mexico-US wall. Mr Trump is now in Brussels for talks with Nato and EU officials. He will also hold meetings with Belgium's King Philippe and Prime Minister Charles Michel. After the meeting between President Trump and the Pope, the Vatican said there had been an ""exchange of views"" on international issues. Mr Trump, who BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says seemed star-struck, said of the Pope: ""He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting and we had a fantastic tour, it was really beautiful. We're liking Italy very much... it was an honour to be with the Pope."" Later Mr Trump tweeted: ""Honor of a lifetime to meet His Holiness Pope Francis. I leave the Vatican more determined than ever to pursue PEACE in our world."" He arrived in Europe from Israel and the Palestinian territories, where he vowed to try to achieve peace in the region. The US leader began his foreign trip with a two-day stop in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, urging Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation. Mr Trump and his entourage arrived at the Vatican just before 08:30, in a meeting that was arranged at the last minute. The US president was greeted by Archbishop Georg Ganswein, the head of the papal household, and escorted by the Swiss Guard to the offices of Pope Francis. Correspondents say Mr Trump seemed subdued during their initial meeting, while Pope Francis was not as jovial as he sometimes is with world leaders. The two men appeared much more relaxed at the end of their 30-minute private meeting. The Vatican said later that they shared a commitment to ""life, and freedom of worship and conscience"" and expressed hope that they can collaborate ""in service to the people in the fields of healthcare, education and assistance to migrants"". On international affairs, their ""exchange of views"" covered the ""promotion of peace in the world through political negotiation and interreligious dialogue"", and highlighted the need to protect Christian communities in the Middle East. After the meeting, they exchanged gifts. Mr Trump gave the Pope a boxed set of writings by the civil rights leader Martin Luther King. The Pope gave Mr Trump a signed copy of a message he delivered for World Peace Day, along with some of his writings about the need to protect the environment.  He also presented him with a small sculptured olive tree, telling Mr Trump through an interpreter: ""It is my desire that you become an olive tree to construct peace"". Mr Trump responded by saying: ""We can use some peace."" He also said he would read the texts the Pope gave him. Mr Trump also met Italy's president and prime minister while in Rome. Ever so slowly and flanked by the Swiss Guard the leader of the world's pre-eminent superpower walked through the Vatican to meet the leader of one of the world's pre-eminent religions.  And were there ever two more different people? Pope Francis with just the merest hint of a smile; President Trump beaming. They sat across from each other in the pontiff's study as though one was going for a job interview. During the election campaign, when Pope Francis visited the US-Mexico border he said that people who choose to build walls and not bridges weren't Christian. Donald Trump said those comments were disgraceful.  And in February, just after Donald Trump had tried to introduce his travel ban from six mainly Muslim countries and suspended the refugee programme, the Pope tweeted: ""How often in the Bible the Lord asks us to welcome migrants and foreigners, reminding us that we too are foreigners!"" The normal mantra when two world leaders meet is to say ""there is more that unites us than divides us"". Almost certainly true. But there are real differences as well.  Mr Trump was joined not only by his wife, daughter and son-in-law but also Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser HR McMaster. Both Melania and Ivanka Trump were dressed in black with their heads partially covered, in keeping with a traditional Vatican protocol that is no longer expected to be rigorously observed.  Melania, a Catholic, asked the Pope to bless her rosary beads.  In a light-hearted exchange, Pope Francis asked her what she gave her husband to eat. It was initially thought he had suggested ""pizza"" to her, but in fact he said potica, which is a cake from Mrs Trump's home country of Slovenia. She laughed in response, and agreed with him. This is Mr Trump's first visit to Europe since taking office in January. Security has been stepped up across Rome, with the areas around the Vatican City, the Italian presidential palace and the American ambassador's residence, where Mr Trump is staying, temporarily closed to traffic.  Despite the heavy police presence, about 100 anti-Trump protesters held a rally in one of Rome's squares on Tuesday evening. Significant protests are also expected in Brussels where he will meet EU and Nato officials. This visit will be about damage limitation with the fervent hope of establishing some kind of transatlantic chemistry, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. She adds that the tone in Brussels has gone from off-the-record sneering when the erratic and unpredictable Mr Trump first won the November elections, to outright concern now that the implications of his presidency have begun to sink in.

"White House denies 'egregious' budget accounting error The White House has denied the president's budget proposal contains an ""egregious"" maths error. Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers pointed out the spending plan double-counts $2tr (£1.5tr). But White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters: ""We stand by the numbers."" Unveiled on Tuesday, the budget proposes deep cuts to welfare programmes. Mr Summers, also formerly chief economist of the World Bank, was one of the first to spot the apparent mistake. UN criticises Trump peacekeeper cuts ""It appears to be the most egregious accounting error in a presidential budget in the nearly 40 years I have been tracking them,"" he wrote on his blog. He said the spending plan was ""simply ludicrous"". The budget forecasts about $2tr in extra federal revenue growth over the next 10 years, which it uses to pay for Mr Trump's ""biggest tax cut in history"". But that very same $2tr is then used to reduce the budget deficit. ""My observation is that there appears to be a logical error of the kind that would justify failing a student in an introductory economics course,"" Mr Summers wrote. A prominent conservative economist agreed there was a discrepancy. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Los Angeles Times the numbers ""don't seem to match"". Trump budget: Global losers of 'America First' plan But Mr Mulvaney said during a press briefing on Tuesday that the alleged gimmick was done ""on purpose"". ""The money can be used to both reduce the budget deficit and offset Mr Trump's proposed tax cuts,"" he told reporters. He added: ""There's other places where we were probably overly conservative in our accounting."" That is not the only problem with President Trump's $4.1tr federal budget, according to analysts on both sides of the political divide. It hinges on the country achieving 3% annual growth, but most economists say this is unlikely for the US. The plan - titled A New Foundation for American Greatness - takes a hatchet to federal programmes for the disadvantaged, such as food stamps, disability payments and healthcare. Democratic lawmakers have savaged the budget, and even fiscally hawkish Republicans seem taken aback by the magnitude of the cuts. The austerity measures ""are astonishing and frankly immoral"", Congresswoman Pramilla Jayapal told Mr Mulvaney as he testified to the House Budget Committee on Wednesday. ""This budget starts by taking away healthcare, then food, then housing, then education, then job opportunities,"" the Washington Democrat said. Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said the budget shows an ""unimaginable level of cruelty"" for millions of Americans and children. But the spending plan is likely to undergo substantial revisions on Capitol Hill before final approval.",Thursday 25 May 2017,25-May-17,Trump budget has 'ludicrous' maths error,"A former US treasury secretary says it is the ""most egregious"" mistake he has seen in four decades.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40023720

"Texas sheriff defends Facebook post on Manchester attack A Texas sheriff who railed against ""political correctness"" in a Facebook post following the Manchester, England, bombing has defended his comments.  Denton County Sheriff Tracy Murphree's controversial post urged Americans to ""pay attention"" to the Islamic jihadists who ""want to kill you"". His comments came after a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured 64 at an Ariana Grande concert in the UK. His remarks quickly drew both praise and outrage online.  ""I stand behind it,"" Mr Murphree told a local NBC news affiliate on Tuesday. ""We need to be realistic about the world we live in."" Mr Murphree wrote on Monday after the attack: ""This is what happens when you disarm your citizens. When you open your borders without the proper vetting.  ""When you allow political correctness to dictate how you respond to an enemy that wants to kill you.  ""The left tells us we must submit and accept these radical beliefs and bend over backwards to make sure we don't hurt anybody's feelings.""  ""The left wants to cater to the very group that would kill every group they claim to support. Folks this is an enemy hell bent on killing you,"" he continued.  He later wrote: ""You better wake up America. While you are distracted by the media and the crying of the left, Islamic Jihadist are among us and want to kill you."" His comments came after a suicide bomber killed 22 people, including children, and wounded 64 others outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.  The viral post quickly attracted hundreds of responses, with some thanking him for ""speaking truth"" and others accusing him of fear-mongering.  Some users also criticised Mr Murphree for using a terrorist attack to promote gun rights.  The local Council for Islamic Relations (CAIR) chapter called the post an ""Islamaphobic rant"".

"Brazil protests: Ministerial building set on fire during clashes Angry demonstrators in Brasilia have started a fire inside the ministry of agriculture and have damaged several other ministerial buildings.  Brazilian authorities estimate around 35,000 are marching in the capital.  Troops are being deployed to defend government buildings and there is a heavy police presence on the streets. Protesters are demanding the resignation of President Michel Temer, fresh elections, and for economic reform plans to be withdrawn.  Mr Temer has faced new corruption allegations in the last week, and is facing growing pressure to step down. According to reports, several ministries are being evacuated because of the protests - but not before the agriculture ministry was damaged. ""There was an invasion of the ministry's private entrance. They lit a fire in a room, broke photos in a gallery of ex-ministers and confronted police,"" a spokesman told the AFP news agency. There have been clashes between police and demonstrators and local media report one person has been injured and several have been detained.  Planned demonstrations began peacefully around midday before clashes with police erupted. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at some demonstrators, and video footage showed other members of the crowd smashing windows or setting makeshift barriers afire. Last week, testimony released by the country's supreme court alleged that Mr Temer had taken millions of dollars in bribes since 2010. The plea-bargain testimony came from bosses of a giant meat-packing firm. In response, Mr Temer vowed to prove his innocence and remain as president while so doing.

"Migrant crisis: Mediterranean rescue as 34 drown At least 34 migrants, some of them young children, have drowned after falling into the sea off the Libyan coast, Italy's coastguard says. The overcrowded boat was carrying about 500 migrants when it suddenly listed, sending about 200 people into the water, a spokesman said. It triggered a frantic operation to search for survivors. The central Mediterranean route for illegal migration to Europe is currently the busiest.  More than 50,000 migrants have reached Italy this year.  The route is also the most deadly, accounting for the vast majority of the 1,364 people who the UN estimates have drowned in the Mediterranean this year. The waiting game: Aboard the Mediterranean's migrant rescue boats African migrants sold in Libya 'slave markets', IOM says One report suggested a private humanitarian group, Moas, had begun lifting people from the crowded wooden boat about 30 nautical miles off Libya, when many fell into the water.  It is thought they may have been knocked off balance by a wave. Chris Catrambone of Moas tweeted pictures from the scene and said bodies were still in the water - including those of toddlers. The Italian coastguard directed other boats to the scene - including Italian, British and Spanish navy vessels - while a helicopter and military aircraft dropped lifeboats, said AFP. Meanwhile, the Italian coastguard said operations in the area had rescued a total of 1,800 people from 10 separate vessels on Wednesday. Leaders of the world's wealthiest nations, the G7, are meeting on the Italian island of Sicily on Friday and the deputy executive director of the UN's children's organisation Unicef urged them to address the continuing tragedy in the seas around them.  ""The tragedy of children dying in the Mediterranean is a wake-up call to leaders meeting in Sicily,"" said Justin Forsyth. ""These extremely vulnerable children need action now."" Good weather conditions off Libya have prompted an increase in the number of migrants leaving for Italy. The waters in the area are busy with boats from the Italian and Libyan coastguards, humanitarian vessels and even scavenger boats hoping to recover abandoned equipment. German NGO Jugend Rettet said on its Facebook page that on Tuesday a Libyan coastguard vessel had fired gunshots as it conducted a rescue. It said the boat was already carrying migrants, presumably picked up from other vessels, who had panicked and thrown themselves overboard only to be shot at themselves. ""We can not say whether and how many dead there were in the shooting,"" the 25-year-old captain, named only Jonas, was quoted as saying.  ""We had to be careful not to get a bullet ourselves. We are speechless against this crude violence.""  It said two boats had then been towed illegally back to Libya where captured migrants can be housed in camps notorious for human right abuses. Earlier this year, human rights groups voiced concern after EU leaders agreed a deal with Libya's UN-backed government to reinforce its coastguard and curb more attempted migrant crossings. Libya is a gateway to Europe for migrants from across sub-Saharan Africa and also from the Arabian peninsula, Egypt, Syria and Bangladesh. Many are fleeing war, poverty or persecution.  A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

Mr Duterte said insurgents had beheaded a policeman on the southern island. At least three other members of the security forces are reported dead. On Tuesday he imposed martial law on Mindanao, where Muslim separatists and other rebels are fighting the army. Some of the groups have pledged support for so-called Islamic State (IS). Thousands of people have been fleeing fighting in the city of Marawi after gunmen rampaged through the city. ""I will not hesitate to do anything and everything to protect and preserve the Filipino nation,"" the president said. ""I might declare martial law throughout the country to protect the people."" President Duterte said the police chief of Malabang on Mindanao had been stopped on his way home ""at a checkpoint manned by terrorists and I think they decapitated them right there and then"". As he imposed 60 days of martial law on the island on Tuesday, he warned he would be harsh in dealing with terrorism.  ""If it takes a year to do it, then we'll do it. If it's over within a month, then I would be happy,"" he said in a video posted online by the government. Mr Duterte cut short his visit to Russia to deal with the violence. During his talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he also said the Philippines needed more modern weapons to fight IS militants and other militant groups. Martial law allows the use of the military to enforce order and the detention of people without charge for long periods. The Philippine constitution says a president can only declare martial law for 60 days to stop an invasion or a rebellion. Parliament can revoke the measure within 48 hours while the Supreme Court can review its legality. This is only the second time martial law has been declared since the fall in 1986 of President Ferdinand Marcos.  The violence in Marawi, a city of about 200,000 people in Mindanao, erupted on Tuesday as the army searched for the leader of a militant group that had pledged allegiance to IS, the military said. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana identified the militants as members of the Maute group. They had occupied a hospital and a jail, and burnt down buildings including a church, he added.  Marawi is about 800km (500 miles) south of the capital Manila. Mr Duterte had promised that finding a lasting peace on the island would be a top priority for his administration.  But the conflict is complex and deep-rooted, the BBC's Jonathan Head reports. Solutions have eluded previous governments, and it is not clear that President Duterte's reliance on martial law will prove any more successful, our correspondent says.",Thursday 25 May 2017,25-May-17,Duterte eyes nationwide martial law,The warning comes after soldiers clashed with militants in the southern Philippines.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40024120
"Ex-officer helps exonerate US prisoner after 24 years A Philadelphia man has been exonerated and freed from prison 24 years after he was found guilty of a murder he did not commit. Shaurn Thomas, 43, was released after the Philadelphia District Attorney's office agreed that the evidence did not support the conviction. Mr Thomas, who was 19 when found guilty, maintained all along he was at another court hearing during the crime. ""I feel wonderful,"" he said as he left the prison. He hugged his fiancee and family outside the jail in Frackville, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday evening. ""I don't got no animosity towards nobody. What for?"" said Mr Thomas. ""Life's too short for that. I just move on forward. ""It's a tragedy that happened to me, but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one."" Mr Thomas was jailed for the 1990 murder of a Puerto Rican businessman who was shot while trying to cash a $25,000 (£19,000) cheque. His lawyer, former Philadelphia police sergeant James Figorski, worked pro bono for more than eight years on behalf of the Pennsylvania Innocence Project to secure his release. ""Shaurn engaged in a decades' long struggle to prove his innocence,"" Mr Figorski said in a statement.  ""I joined him in that struggle, and many times it seemed that we would never succeed and he would remain in prison for the rest of his life."" Mr Thomas had said he was at a correctional centre for youth offenders in connection with an unrelated case at the time of the murder. But the sign-in logs that would have proved his alibi went missing, and jurors did not believe his mother and sister, who said they were with him. Homicide detectives had named several other suspects in a case file, but somehow managed to lose the document for more than two decades until it turned up only recently.  Mr Thomas insists he holds no grudges over his conviction, and is looking forward to his future, which he hopes will include a holiday on a tropical island.

"Manchester attack: Trump condemns media leaks Leaks to American media about the investigation into the Manchester Arena attack are ""deeply troubling"", US President Donald Trump has said. They were a ""grave threat to our national security"", he added, and pledged to get to the bottom of them. US media published photos of evidence from the scene of Monday night's blast. Earlier, UK police said they had stopped sharing information with the US as a consequence but those ties have now been resumed. The decision to end the suspension was taken after assurances were received by counter-terrorism officers in the UK. A diplomatic tiff broke out after the New York Times published photos on Wednesday appearing to show debris from the crime scene, including bloodstained fragments from the bomb. The move outraged British police and government officials, and prompted Mr Trump to address the matter during a visit to Brussels. ""These leaks have been going on for a long time,"" he said. He pledged to ask the US Department of Justice to launch a review, and ""if appropriate, the culprit should be prosecuted"". ""There is no relationship we cherish more than the special relationship between the US and the UK,"" he added. Meanwhile, police have been assessing ""potentially suspicious items"" found at a property in Wigan, some 16 miles from the scene of Monday night's attack. A street was evacuated for several hours and a bomb disposal unit called in. The cordon has now been lifted and residents have been allowed to return to their homes. No controlled explosion was carried out, but the search at the address continues. The raid comes after Salman Abedi blew himself up at the end of an Ariana Grande concert three days ago, killing 22 people and injuring 116. Mr Trump, who is at a Nato summit along with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, paid tribute to those who died in the attack. ""Innocent little girls and so many others were horribly murdered and badly injured whilst attending a concert,"" he said. ""Beautiful lives with so much great potential, torn from their families for ever and ever. It was a barbaric and vicious attack upon our civilisation. ""All people who cherish life must unite in finding, exposing and removing these killers and extremists, and yes, losers, they are losers. ""Wherever they exist in our societies we must drive them out and never, ever let them back in."" Abedi detonated his ""nuts-and-bolts"" bomb at the end of the gig as people were making their way out of the arena. Others were waiting in the foyer to pick up family and friends. Security officials say they have thwarted 18 plots since 2013, including five since the Westminster attack in March. General election campaigning, which was suspended in the wake of the Manchester attack, will resume on Friday, with Labour set to draw links between wars abroad and terrorism ""at home"". Leader Jeremy Corbyn will say that under a Labour government, UK foreign policy would change to one that ""reduces rather than increases the threat"" to the country. Greater Manchester Police were said to be ""furious"" with the New York Times' report and said they would temporarily stop sharing information with the US. Police chief constable Ian Hopkins said the leak undermined the investigation and had distressed families ""already suffering terribly with their loss"". The New York Times newspaper defended its decision to publish the pictures, saying they were ""neither graphic nor disrespectful of victims"". Prime Minister Theresa May said she would make clear to Mr Trump that shared intelligence must remain secure, at the Nato summit. UK officials believe that US law enforcement rather than the White House is the likely culprit for the leaks, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says. The Queen has been to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital to meet some of the injured, and members of the emergency services. During her visit, she paid tribute to Manchester and the ""extraordinary"" way the city had responded to the attack. Earlier, a minute's silence fell over offices, public squares, shops and in homes as people honoured the victims. In St Ann's Square, a perfectly-observed silence was followed by applause, cheers and a spontaneous crowd rendition of the Oasis song Don't Look Back in Anger.  Lydia Rullow, who started the singing, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It just felt like the right moment.  ""It wasn't something that I'd planned or thought about, but I had been thinking about that song in particular in the past few days. ""Everyone started joining in and it was really beautiful. You should drown out any of the fear and hate with beautiful voices. That's the best thing to do."" In other developments: Police believe Manchester-born suicide bomber Salman Abedi, from a family of Libyan origin, acted as part of a network. Whitehall sources say 22-year-old Abedi was among a ""large pool of people whose risk was kept under review"" by security services.  In total 10 people have been arrested in the UK since Monday night. A man and a woman have since been released without charge. Eight men remain in custody as part of the ongoing investigation. Raids involving controlled explosions have been carried out at flats in the city centre and at an address in Moss Side.  On Friday, police said they had searched an address in the St Helens area of Merseyside in connection with the attack. In the Libyan capital Tripoli, Abedi's younger brother Hashem, 20, and their father, Ramadan, were held by special forces linked to the interior ministry. Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent It could be over in hours - or it could take weeks. That's how unknowable an acute counter-terrorism investigation can be for MI5 and the police. While there is a sense that there has been significant headway in the last 24 hours, we should be careful about reading too much, too soon, into how long it will take Greater Manchester Police and their colleagues to be sure they have dealt with every single possible lead after Monday's events. In recent years, we've got a greater understanding of how the more secretive end of these massive operations play out. At any one time, MI5 is handling in the region of 500 active investigations involving 3,000 ""SOIs"" - ""subjects of interest"" in security world jargon. Read more from Dominic here. Of the 22 victims killed at Manchester Arena, 21 have been named. The youngest known victim so far is eight-year-old Saffie Roussos from Lancashire, who was described as ""simply a beautiful little girl"" by her head teacher.  The oldest victim was Jane Tweddle-Taylor, 51 and from Blackpool, who had gone to the arena with a friend to pick up her friend's daughter.  An off-duty Cheshire police officer Elaine McIver was also among the dead. In a statement, her family said: ""Despite what has happened to her, she would want us all to carry on regardless and not be frightened by fear tactics."" On Thursday evening, well-wishers in a convoy of bikes, scooters and cars adorned with pink ribbons and balloons wound their way from Bury to Manchester to pay tribute to 15-year-old Bury victim, Olivia Campbell. Of the 116 injured, 75 remain in hospital. Of those, 23 are in critical care - five of them children. More details have begun to emerge about 22-year-old suicide bomber Abedi. His sister, Jomana, has said she believed her brother may have been reacting to US-led strikes in the Middle East. ""He saw the explosives America drops on children in Syria, and he wanted revenge.  ""Whether he got that is between him and God,"" she reportedly told the Wall Street Journal. It is also being reported that a Libyan government spokesman said 15 minutes before he blew himself up, Abedi called his mother and brother. His movements in the run-up to the attack have also come into focus, with reports that he left the UK for a while, but returned in the days before the bombing.  During a trip back from Libya, where his parents now live, he briefly stopped at Düsseldorf Airport, having reportedly been in Prague, but remained in the airport's transit zone. The BBC also understands Abedi was in Manchester earlier this year, when he told people of the value of dying for a cause and made hardline statements about suicide operations and the conflict in Libya. At the age of 16 and during his school holidays, Abedi is believed to have fought with his father in Libya against the Gaddafi regime, according to BBC Newsnight.  Greater Manchester Police would not comment on these claims. In recent days, former classmates of Abedi have variously described him as jokey, gullible and short-tempered. Another, who did not want to be named, told the BBC's World At One Abedi did not ""come across as an intelligent person"". Asked whether he thought Abedi might have been manipulated by more intelligent people, he replied: ""A hundred percent.  ""I can't imagine the idea that he would be able to go through with such a complicated procedure. He must have had help."" ""I wasn't shocked,"" the classmate added.

"Trump Russia inquiry: Kushner under FBI scrutiny - US media President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is under FBI scrutiny as part of the Russia investigation, according to US media. Reports say investigators believe he has relevant information, but he is not necessarily suspected of a crime. The FBI is looking into potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election and links with Mr Trump's campaign. The president denies any collusion. Mr Kushner's lawyer said his client would co-operate with any inquiry. President Trump has described the Russia investigations as ""the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history"".  US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to tip the election in favour of the Republican, who beat his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. US officials, who were not named, told NBC News that the interest in Mr Kushner, 36, did not mean the investigators suspected him of a crime or intended to charge him. Separately, the Washington Post reported that the investigators were focusing on meetings he held last year with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak, and a banker from Moscow, Sergei Gorkov. Mr Gorkov is the head of Vnesheconombank, which has been subject to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. The bank is under the control of Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and other members of the government, and has been used to fund major projects such as the 2014 Winter Olympics in the southern Russian resort of Sochi. Mr Kushner has said he did not discuss sanctions with Mr Gorkov. Robert Mueller, a former FBI boss, last week was named by the justice department as special counsel to oversee the Russia inquiry. Congress is also looking into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election and any Trump campaign ties. Mr Kushner has already agreed to discuss his Russian contacts with the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings,"" Mr Kushner's lawyer Jamie Gorelick told the BBC. ""He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry,"" the lawyer added. Calls for a special investigation have mounted since President Trump fired the most recent FBI director, James Comey, earlier this month. The White House has been engulfed in crisis over allegations that Mr Trump asked the ousted FBI chief to drop an inquiry into links between his ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia. Mr Flynn was forced out in February after he misled the vice-president about his conversations with Russia's ambassador before Mr Trump took office in January.

"Mark Zuckerberg gets honorary Harvard degree after dropping out Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has returned to Harvard University under rainy skies to give a graduation speech and receive an honorary degree. The world's fifth-richest person, worth $62.3bn (£48.1bn), famously dropped out of Harvard after launching the global social-networking website. Mr Zuckerberg called for students to ""not only create new jobs, but create a new sense of purpose"". Political experts think he may be positioning himself to run for office. During his remarks on Thursday, Mr Zuckerberg told graduates that ""we live in an unstable time"". ""There's pressure to turn inwards,"" he said about those that feel left behind by increased globalisation. ""This is the struggle of our time. The forces of freedom, openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism and nationalism."" With his wife, Priscilla, in the audience, he pointed to the dormitory where he launched Facebook, and remarked that meeting her there was the best thing to happen to him at the university. Before giving remarks, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree during Harvard's 366th graduation ceremony. On Wednesday, he did a Facebook Live broadcast from his old dorm room. ""This is literally where I sat,"" he says, pointing to a small wooden desk and chair inside Kirkland House, which is due to be renovated over the summer.  ""I had my little laptop here. And this is where I programmed Facebook,"" he tells the camera. During his commencement address, Mr Zuckerberg told students: ""There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in ten years when millions of students can't afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business. ""When you don't have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise we all lose,"" he continued. He told stories of meeting ""children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts, who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something to do"". The 33-year-old appeared to get choked up at one point during a story about an high school student who feared he would not be able to enrol in university because he was an undocumented immigrant. More than 1.9 billion people log onto Facebook every day. Since its launch in 2004, Facebook has inspired many other social media competitors, including Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram.

"Greek ex-PM Lucas Papademos injured in Athens car blast Former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has been injured by an explosion inside his car in Athens. Reports say the blast may have been caused by a letter bomb. Mr Papademos, 69, had leg, arm and stomach injuries, but officials said his condition was ""not a cause for concern"". His driver was also injured - but not seriously. Reports say at least one other person in the car was hurt. No group has so far claimed responsibility for Thursday's blast.  Mr Papademos was appointed caretaker prime minister in November 2011 amid political and economic turmoil. He served in post until May 2012. He has also served as vice-president of the European Central Bank. The explosion occurred at about 18:30 local time (15:30 GMT) in central Athens. Mr Papademos and his driver, who has not been named, were then taken to Evangelismos Hospital. Reports say the third person in the car was a banking official. Current Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who is attending a Nato summit in Brussels, is being kept informed of the incident, Greek news agency ANA said.

"SOS mystery in remote Western Australia stumps police Is it a false alarm, or a genuine plea for help?  An SOS signal made of rocks in a remote part of Western Australia has prompted fears that someone, or more than one person, could be missing. The distress signal was spotted by a helicopter pilot. It led to a ground search by police who had to reach the area by air because of tough terrain. Authorities have now appealed for public help after failing to find ""any indication of recent human activity"". However, police said they had discovered the remains of a campsite at the scene, which is at Swift Bay about 500km (300 miles) from the city of Broome. ""Police are trying to establish if there are any missing persons in the area who require assistance,"" they said in a statement.

She found her husband, Ravi Shankar, thanks to a wrong number.  The 26-year-old, who was attacked by a relative in 2012, said finding love felt like a miracle. ""Ms Bansi had accidentally dialled my number about three months ago. I called her back after 15 days,"" Mr Singh, 27, who works for a CCTV company, told The Hindu newspaper.

"Donald Trump tells Nato allies to pay up at Brussels talks US President Donald Trump has told his Nato allies in Brussels that all members of the alliance must pay their fair share of defence spending.   ""Massive amounts of money"" were owed, he said, voicing a long-held US concern that others are not paying enough. But Nato states' contributions are voluntary and a target of spending 2% of GDP on defence is only a guideline. The alliance later agreed that member-states would report back annually on defence spending to Nato.  Again condemning Monday's bombing in Manchester, Mr Trump said terrorism must be ""stopped in its tracks"". He called for a moment of silence in memory of the 22 adults and children killed in the ""savage attack"". Before visiting Nato's new headquarters, which was formally opened at Thursday's gathering, Mr Trump met several EU leaders for the first time, including France's new President, Emmanuel Macron.  His first foreign tour as president will end on the Italian island of Sicily at a G7 summit on Friday. For those within Nato uncertain about President Trump's commitment to the alliance, his brief visit to open the new headquarters building in Brussels will have provided little reassurance.  The commander-in-chief of the most powerful military in Nato still seems unclear as to how its defence resources are generated.  He spoke again of countries who fall short of the Nato defence spending target as ""owing"" money from past years - which is not how things work at all.  He made what seemed intended as an amusing aside, noting he had not asked what the new headquarters building had cost. Well, he ought to know because the US has provided its share of the funding! And there was no explicit re-statement of his administration's commitment to Nato's mutual security guarantees - the bedrock of the alliance. The mere fact that this question is raised at all shows just how uneasy remains the relationship between Mr Trump and the organisation of which his country is the leading member. According to Nato's 2016 annual report, only five countries met the 2% defence spending target - the US, the UK, Greece, Poland and Estonia.  The alliance hopes that all 28 member-states will reach this target by 2024.  ""This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States, and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and [from] not paying in those past years,"" Mr Trump said. Germany spent 1.2% on defence in that period, but Berlin argues that its spending on development aid also contributes to international security.  Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg announced after Thursday's talks that member-states would begin submitting annual national plans this year in the interests of transparency.   ""Trump has been clear on his commitment to Nato,"" he insisted. ""But President Trump has also been clear in the message to all allies that we have to deliver on the pledge we made to increase defence spending."" Mr Trump has been criticised for his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his administration is embroiled in allegations of close ties with Russian interests. But at Nato HQ, he said: ""The Nato of the future must include a great focus on terrorism and immigration, as well as on threats from Russia and on Nato's eastern and southern borders."" There was some concern that Mr Trump had not mentioned Article Five, Nato's commitment to mutual defence in the event of an attack on a member, but an unnamed White House official told Reuters news agency that the president stood united with other Nato leaders.   Earlier, European Council President Donald Tusk said after meeting Mr Trump: ""I'm not 100% sure we can say that we have a common position... on Russia although when it comes to the conflict on Ukraine we were on the same line.""  ""Terrorism must be stopped in its tracks or the horror you saw in Manchester, and so many other places, will continue forever,"" he said. ""You have thousands and thousands of people pouring into our various countries and spreading throughout, and in many cases we have no idea who they are. We must be tough, we must be strong and we must be vigilant.""       Earlier, he condemned the leaking of details of the investigation to US media.  It has agreed to take a bigger role in the campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) and others, but France and Germany insist the move is mostly symbolic. There are concerns that Nato joining the anti-IS coalition could lead to the alliance becoming embroiled in post-conflict Iraq or Libya as it did in Afghanistan, says the BBC's Jonathan Marcus. ""Some issues remain open, like climate and trade,"" Mr Tusk said after he and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker met Mr Trump. EU leaders are concerned that Mr Trump may abandon a US commitment to reduce greenhouse gases under the UN Paris accord. Mr Juncker said that at his meeting with Mr Trump, both sides had emphasised ""that we should have free but fair competition"". ""There's going to be a Commission delegation and a Trump delegation in the next few weeks to come together on trade matters because we felt there was too much divergence, too much divergence in our analysis and our measures.""  The atmosphere between the US conservative and the French centrist appeared strained when they met at the US embassy in Brussels. The two leaders clasped each other's hands, leaning in towards each other slightly. Mr Trump started to pull away, but Mr Macron held on tighter and refused to let him go, the BBC's Tara McKelvey reports.

"Everest climbers worried about oxygen bottle theft Foreign climbers and Sherpas on Mount Everest are concerned about the increasing theft of oxygen bottles from high camps. They say it could threaten the lives of mountaineers because they each have a set supply for weather and traffic-related delays, as well as for the descent. The concerns have been raised as the last groups of mountaineers wait for the weather to clear for their final push to the summit. Experts say crowds of mountaineers, with many inexperienced climbers and unqualified guides, have also contributed to the situation.   ""It is becoming a serious issue up there,"" Nima Tenji Sherpa, a mountain guide just back from Everest, told the BBC. ""I kept on hearing from expedition groups that their oxygen bottles had disappeared and that could be life-threatening - particularly when they have used up what they are carrying on their way up and they are still not on the summit yet, or they plan to use the stocked bottles on their way back."" Foreign climbers have posted about the theft on social media. ""Another seven bottles of oxygen have gone missing from our supply,"" wrote expedition leader Tim Mosedale on Facebook last Monday. ""This time from the South Col (camp four, the last camp before Everest at 7,900m)."" ""Thankfully Pemba, having summited Lhotse yesterday, had enough energy to go to the South Col and check our supply and report his findings. ""But will it still be there when we arrive in a few days or will a few more bottles of magic air have gone missing?"" Earlier, Mr Mosedale had posted about a similar incident on Lhotse mountain near Everest. ""As long as we know that our oxygen is being used, we can get it resupplied. But to turn up and take it causes not only an issue for the summit team but also jeopardises the lives of other climbers."" Although it was earlier reported that the death toll this season had reached 10, Nepalese authorities have said they can only confirm five deaths so far. None of the deaths has been linked to the theft of oxygen bottles. ""What can you do when thieves break the locks of the tent and take away oxygen bottles, food and even cooking gas?"" said Phurba Namgyal Sherpa, general secretary of the Nepal National Mountain Guides Association (NNMGA). ""It is becoming a trend. ""Because of such incidents, climbers have had to return without reaching the summit because when you learn that you no more have the life-saving bottles, the first thing you want to do is get back to the base camp."" Nima Tenji Sherpa said he had to give his oxygen bottle to his client in 2012 when they were on their way back because their stocks were stolen. ""We were descending and we saw that our bottles were gone and my client had already used up his oxygen, I took a risk and gave him my bottle. ""Fortunately we made it to the lower camps."" According to the NNMGA, climbers use seven bottles of oxygen on average on their way up and down. Climbers can inhale it at different rates and if they consume it at the highest rate of inhaling, a bottle can last up to five hours.  Mountaineers normally use the bottled oxygen above Camp Three, but they need to keep on climbing up and down to acclimatise before the final summit bid during the right weather window.  That means they might also use the bottles while camping in the higher camps.             Veteran Sherpa climbers said no-one has been caught stealing the bottles yet. They suspect it could be groups that are ill-prepared and face life-threatening situations because they do not have adequate supplies.  They say there is also an increasing practice of stealing oxygen bottles from high camps and bringing them down to base camp to sell them. ""That market appears to be thriving at the base camp,"" said Nima Tenji Sherpa. Government officials are aware of all this. They say they are trying to introduce a new rule that will require each climber to have a Sherpa climber so that everyone has enough basic requirements such as oxygen bottles, medicine and food. ""We have proposed for this to be included in the mountaineering regulation but there has to be a cabinet-level decision on this,"" said an official at the tourism ministry, who did not wish to be named. ""Frequent changes in the government have meant that our ministry has been getting a new minister every few months, and issues like this don't get addressed."" The government has given permission to nearly 400 mountaineers to climb Mount Everest this season. Approximately 300 have already climbed the highest peak and the remainder are waiting for the weather to clear, say officials.",Friday 26 May 2017,26-May-17,Everest climbers worried about oxygen theft,There is concern about the increasing theft of oxygen bottles from high camps.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40050483
"Theresa May: Online extremism 'must be tackled' Theresa May has urged world leaders to do more to combat online extremism, saying the fight against so-called Islamic State is ""moving from the battlefield to the internet"". At the G7 summit in Sicily, the PM said tech companies had to do more to identify and remove extreme material. She also urged more action on tackling foreign fighters who travel to join IS.  Meanwhile, UK police have arrested another man in connection with Monday's terror attack in Manchester.  Twenty-two people were killed and 116 injured when a suicide bomber targeted an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena on Monday evening. Corbyn links terror threat to wars abroad BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mrs May had met the French president Emmanuel Macron at the summit and both agreed that the recent attacks in Manchester and Paris showed the need for greater cooperation.  Mrs May warned that fighters returning to their home countries from countries like Iraq and Syria posed a new terrorist threat and urged G7 members to work with ""our partners in the region to step up returns and prosecutions of foreign fighters. ""This means improving intelligence sharing, evidence gathering and bolstering countries' police and legal processes,"" she said. G7 members needed to be able to share data securely in order to track fighters as they cross borders and make decisions about whether to prosecute them, she said. The PM also sought common ground on tackling online extremism as she chaired a counter-terrorism session at the summit in Italy, looking at how countries could work together to prevent online plotting of terrorist attacks and to stop the spread of extremist ideology. The prime minister argued that, as IS militants lose ground in the Middle East, the threat was ""evolving rather than disappearing"" and that the industry had a ""social responsibility"" to do more to take down harmful content, arguing it had taken some action but had not gone far enough. She wants an international forum to develop the means of intervening where danger is detected, and for companies to develop tools which automatically identify and remove harmful material based on what it contains and who posted it. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed France's total support for Britain's fight against terrorism as he met Mrs May at the summit. ""We will be here to cooperate and do everything we can in order to increase this cooperation at the European level, in order to do more from a bilateral point of view against terrorism,"" he told her, in their first formal meeting since he took office. Security minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the use of online communications was ""one of the biggest challenges"" in the fight against terrorism, with encryption making it ""almost impossible for us to actually lift the lid on these people"".  ""And the scale of it is not just the UK, it is across the whole of Europe, across the world."" He said the giant American tech companies like Facebook and Google could be doing more.

"US Republican Greg Gianforte charged over Guardian reporter 'body slam' The Republican candidate in a special congressional election in Montana, Greg Gianforte, has been charged with a misdemeanour for assaulting a Guardian reporter. Journalist Ben Jacobs tweeted that Mr Gianforte had ""body slammed"" him, breaking his glasses. The front runner's campaign said that Mr Jacobs had initiated the incident by grabbing Mr Gianforte's wrist. But other journalists said they saw the reporter show no physical aggression. The incident took place on Wednesday, the eve of a special election to fill a vacant seat in the House of Representatives. The Guardian released an audio recording of the clash, in which crashing sounds can be heard when Mr Jacobs presses the candidate for a response to a question. Mr Gianforte then shouts ""I'm sick and tired of you guys"" and tells the reporter to ""get the hell out of here"". Alicia Acuna of Fox News was in the room with two colleagues preparing for a television interview with Mr Gianforte at the time. She said Mr Jacobs entered the room, put a voice recorder up to Mr Gianforte's face and asked about the Congressional Budget Office report on the American Health Care Act. When Mr Jacobs persisted, ""Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him"", she wrote. ""Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter.

"US air strike on IS killed 105 civilians in Iraq's Mosul The United States has admitted that at least 105 Iraqi civilians were killed in an air strike it carried out in Mosul in March. US Central Command (CentCom) said it had targeted two snipers from so-called Islamic State (IS) with what it called a ""precision-guided munition"". However, the strike detonated explosives that militants had placed in the building, CentCom said. Civilians sheltering in the lower floors were killed when it collapsed. In another incident, 35 civilians were killed on Thursday in US-led coalition air strikes in an eastern Syrian town, monitors said. The strikes targeted the IS-held town of Mayadeen in the province of Deir Ezzor, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Families of IS fighters, including children, were among those killed, it added. CentCom said the death toll in the March attack in Iraq included four civilians in another nearby structure. Eyewitnesses claimed another 36 non-combatants were also in the building, but US authorities said it had ""insufficient evidence to determine their status"". CentCom previously said the planes had acted at the request of Iraqi security forces, as coalition forces attempted to wrest control of the city from IS. The civilians had gathered in the lower floors of the building after being expelled from their homes by IS fighters, a declassified summary of the report said. Those organising the strike ""could not have predicted the presence of civilians in the structure prior to the engagement,"" it added. US officials said the type of bomb was chosen ""to minimise collateral damage,"" but the explosives hidden by IS were at least four times more powerful than the weapon itself. ""Our condolences go out to all those that were affected,"" Major General Joe Martin said in a statement.  ""The coalition takes every feasible measure to protect civilians from harm."" Initial media reports had placed the casualty estimates as high as 200. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled the northern Iraqi city as the operation to reclaim it has continued. Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, are involved in the offensive, which was launched in October 2016. The government announced the full ""liberation"" of eastern Mosul in January 2017. But the west of the city has presented a more difficult challenge, with its narrow, winding streets. Iraq has also opened an inquiry into claims that its forces abused and killed civilians in the battle for the city.",Friday 26 May 2017,26-May-17,US attack on IS killed 105 civilians,The US military says the March air strike detonated explosives militants had hidden in the building.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40051640

"Egypt hits 'jihadist camps' after attack on Coptic Christians Egyptian forces have struck ""terrorist training camps"" in retaliation for an attack on Coptic Christians, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has said. State media say six strikes hit the town of Derna in neighbouring Libya. Gunmen earlier attacked a bus carrying worshippers in central Egypt, killing at least 28 people and wounding 25 others. President Sisi said he would ""not hesitate to strike terrorist camps anywhere"". Announcing the strike in a TV speech late on Friday, he promised to ""protect our people from the evil"". Countries supporting terrorism should be punished, he said, as he appealed to US President Donald Trump for help. Military sources told Reuters news agency that the militants targeted in Libya had been involved in the attack on Egyptian Christians earlier in the day. Although no group immediately said it was behind the attack, Islamic State (IS) militants have targeted Copts several times in recent months. Libya is effectively controlled by a large number of armed militias that have emerged in the chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. But IS has also built a presence in Libya during the chaos. Egypt has launched air strikes against IS in Libya before. In 2015, the military bombed several sites, also near Derna, after militants released a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians. The Copts killed on Friday had been travelling to the Monastery of St Samuel the Confessor, 135km (85 miles) south of Cairo, from Minya province when their bus came under fire.  It was in a small convoy that was stopped on a desert road near a police station on the border with Beni Suef provinces. Gunmen wearing military uniforms attacked the convoy with automatic weapons before fleeing in 4X4 vehicles, eyewitnesses said. Minya Province Bishop Makarios said many of the victims were shot at point blank range, the New York Times reported. He said that children had been on the bus and were among the dead, adding that a pick-up truck in the convoy carrying workmen at the monastery was also targeted. Minutes after President Sisi's speech, the White House released a statement of support from Mr Trump. ""This merciless slaughter of Christians in Egypt tears at our hearts and grieves our souls,"" he said. ""America stands with President Sisi and all the Egyptian people today, and always, as we fight to defeat this common enemy,"" he added. Copts make up about 10% of Egypt's population of 92 million. Two suicide bombings at Palm Sunday services at churches in the northern cities of Alexandria and Tanta on 9 April left 46 people dead. Those attacks prompted President Sisi to declare a three-month nationwide state of emergency and promise to do whatever was necessary to confront jihadist militants, most of whom are based in northern Sinai. But many Copts complain that the Egyptian authorities are not doing enough to protect them, says the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo. There is now a real sense of fear, and a feeling of being hunted, she adds.",Saturday 27 May 2017,27-May-17,Egypt hits 'jihadist camps' after attack,"The military strike, reportedly in Libya, follows a deadly attack on Coptic Christians.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40067473
"G7 demand action on extremist net content at summit Leaders from the group of leading industrial nations, the G7, have called on internet giants to crack down on extremist content.  They warned internet service providers and social media companies to ""substantially increase"" their efforts.  But the summit in Taormina, Sicily, failed to agree on climate change. US President Donald Trump, attending his first such summit, held off from endorsing the 2015 deal on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Separately, Mr Trump and UK Prime Minister Theresa May reaffirmed plans to boost trade, including a post-Brexit trade deal. Mr Trump has welcomed the UK's vote to leave the European Union (EU). Mrs May was also attending her first G7 summit, as were Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and French President Emmanuel Macron. The G7 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, while the EU also has representatives present. ""We showed our united commitment and our determination to continue and to strengthen our fight against terrorism,"" said Mr Gentiloni. The leaders signed a document saying more should be done by internet companies to identify and remove extremist material. The leaders also voiced solidarity with the UK after Monday's bombing in Manchester in which 22 people, including children, were killed.  ""We agreed the threat from Daesh [the Islamic State group] is evolving rather than disappearing,"" Mrs May said. ""As they lose ground in Iraq and Syria, foreign fighters are returning and the group's hateful ideology is spreading online. Make no mistake, the fight is moving from the battlefield to the internet.""  ""The question of the Paris climate accord is still hanging,"" said Mr Gentiloni. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the discussions with Mr Trump had been ""intensive"". ""The United States made clear that it has not yet made its decision and will not do so here, but rather will continue to work on this,"" she said. President Trump, who once dismissed global warming as a ""hoax"", has previously threatened to pull out of the Paris agreement. According to the French news agency AFP, President Macron ""snubbed"" the British prime minister when they held their first official talks on the sidelines of the summit. Mrs May told him that the UK and the 27 EU member states should be discussing their future relationship at the same time as discussing the terms of the UK's withdrawal, a Downing Street spokesman said.  However, a source in the French delegation said Mr Macron had repeated the EU's position that the terms of the divorce must be agreed first. Mrs May later told reporters she had had a ""very good and productive discussion"" with Mr Macron.  Mr Gentiloni said progress had been made but the wording of the final communique still needed to be worked out.  ""But it seems to me the direct discussions today have produced common positions that we can work on,"" he added. There has been concern that the US president might promote a protectionist agenda. German weekly Der Spiegel quoted Mr Trump as saying in a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday that Germans were ""very bad"" regarding car exports to the US. During his election campaign last year, Mr Trump threatened customs duties in retaliation for Germany's trade surplus with the US, saying it owed ""vast sums of money"" to the US and Nato. There has been uncertainty over Mr Trump's position on sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine. However, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said at the summit on Friday: ""We're not lowering our sanctions on Russia. If anything we would look to get tougher on Russia.""  The US president and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe discussed the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea. They agreed to ""enhance sanctions on North Korea, including by identifying and sanctioning entities that support North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes"", the White House said. On Saturday, the second and final day, the leaders are expected to discuss human mobility, food security and gender equality. Thousands of people are expected to join a protest march against the summit near Taormina. Melania Trump and other spouses toured Sicily by helicopter, taking in Mount Etna and visiting the nearby town of Catania.   According to the Spanish news agency Efe, Mrs Trump flew separately from the others for security reasons.  Making his first foreign trip as president, he came to Sicily from Brussels where he had held talks with EU and Nato leaders. At Nato headquarters, he complained that many Nato member states were not spending enough on defence, expecting America to bear the burden. Before that, he visited Pope Francis in Rome and toured the Middle East - first Saudi Arabia, then Israel and the Palestinian territories.",Saturday 27 May 2017,27-May-17,G7 demand action on extremist net content,But other world leaders fail to persuade Donald Trump to back a landmark climate change deal.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40055027

"UK achieves solar power record as temperatures soar A record amount of solar power was generated on Friday as Britain basked in sunshine and temperatures of up to 28C, the National Grid has said.   It said 8.7 gigawatts (GW) had been generated at lunchtime, representing 24.3% of total generation across the UK.  The level tops the previous record of 8.48GW set on 10 May. Duncan Burt, head of control room operations at National Grid, called it the ""beginning of a new era"". ""We now have significant volumes of renewable energy on the system,"" he said. ""We also have the tools available to ensure we can balance supply and demand."" Alongside the contribution from solar, 23% of power came from nuclear sources, 30% from natural gas and just 1.4% from coal.  Wind, hydro power and biomass were also used.  A National Grid spokeswoman said the record level of solar power was achieved largely because of the clear and sunny weather on Friday.  She added that it would have been significantly harder to reach if it had been cloudy.  Britain has been getting more of its energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as it seeks to meet European Union targets and phase out coal power plants. However, environmentalists have criticised the government's decision to cut subsidies to the solar power industry in 2015. Hannah Martin, head of energy for Greenpeace in the UK, said: ""Today's new record is a reminder of what the UK could achieve if our government reversed its cuts to support for solar. ""All around the world, solar power keeps beating new records as costs come down and power generation goes up.""  In April, Britain went a full day without using coal to generate electricity for the first time since the 1880s.

"Genene Jones, former Texas nurse, charged again with baby murder A former Texas nurse has been charged with the death of an 11-month-old baby, more than 30 years after she was jailed for killing a toddler. Genene Jones is accused of injecting Joshua Sawyer with a toxic level of Dilantin in December 1981, the year before she killed Chelsea McClellan. Jones, who is suspected of killing as many as 60 infants, was sentenced to 99 years for the little girl's death. But a legal loophole means she is due to be released in March next year. The law at the time Jones, 66, was jailed for Chelsea's murder meant she got a reduced sentence in return for good behaviour - much to the horror of Chelsea's mother, Petti. Ms McClellan told ABC News in 2013 she was searching for a way to keep Jones in prison, saying she needed to find ""another family that was a victim of Genene Jones"". Jones, dubbed the ""Angel of Death"" in US media, had already been sentenced for injecting and nearly killing a second child, shortly after the initial conviction. But the former nurse, who worked in San Antonio and neighbouring Kerr County during the late 1970s and early 1980s, is still ""suspected in dozens of infant deaths"", according to district attorney Nico LaHood. Mr LaHood announced the new charge against Jones - who he described as ""pure evil"" - two years after he set up a task force to look into the case and uncover new evidence. He told a press conference he was confident they had a ""good case"" against Jones, who is currently incarcerated in a women's prison in Gatesville, Texas. ""Our office will attempt to account for every child whose life was stolen by the actions of Jones,"" he said in a statement. ""Our only focus is justice.""",Saturday 27 May 2017,27-May-17,Texas nurse charged again with baby murder,"Genene Jones, dubbed the 'Angel of Death', is suspected of killing as many as 60 infants.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40067949
"Germany vaccination: Fines plan as measles cases rise Parents in Germany who fail to seek medical advice on vaccinating their children could face fines of up to €2,500 (£2,175; $2,800).  Health Minister Hermann Gröhe said it was necessary to tighten the law because of a measles epidemic.  A mother of three died of measles in the city of Essen this week. The government wants kindergartens to report any parents who cannot prove they have had a medical consultation.  However, Germany is not yet making it an offence to refuse vaccinations - unlike Italy.  Speaking to the popular daily Bild, Mr Gröhe said: ""Continuing deaths from measles cannot leave anyone indifferent.""  Under the plan, the children of parents who fail to seek vaccination advice could be expelled from their daycare centre. The law is expected to be adopted next month. The upper house of the German parliament, the Bundesrat, said forcing kindergartens to report some parents to the health authorities might breach data protection laws. Italy has recorded nearly three times more measles cases so far this year than for all of 2016. Last week the Italian government ruled that parents must vaccinate their children against 12 common illnesses before enrolling them at state-run schools. The list includes measles, polio, whooping cough and hepatitis B. Measles outbreak across Europe WHO information on measles By mid-April this year Germany had 410 measles cases, compared with 325 for the whole of 2016, the Robert Koch Institute reported. The institute said that besides children, all adults born since 1970 should get immunised against measles, if they had not had the measles jab or had had it only once. Last week a German court ruled that a father could insist on having his child vaccinated, over the objections of the mother. The case concerned a separated couple, and the child was living with the mother. Italian officials have attacked what they call ""anti-scientific"" theories which have led to vaccination rates falling well below levels deemed safe to prevent outbreaks. Those theories include a long discredited link between autism and the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.  A 2010 survey of vaccinations EU-wide and in Iceland and Norway found much variation in policy. The Venice project survey reported that 15 countries had no mandatory vaccinations, and the rest had at least one mandatory vaccination. The level of compliance was high, including in countries where vaccinations were recommended, not mandatory. The report concluded that ""the label 'mandatory' is not the only driver behind achieving a high vaccination coverage, and many other factors can play a role, such as the use of combined vaccines, prices for the recipient, kind of offer, information and promotional campaigns"".  The World Health Organization (WHO) says that since the introduction of two doses of anti-measles vaccine across Europe the number of cases has dropped sharply. The total in 2016 - about 5,000 - was the lowest ever recorded. But 14 European countries are described as ""endemic"" for measles, and most cases this year were reported in seven of them: France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Switzerland and Ukraine. The largest outbreaks are in Italy and Romania, the WHO says. The second measles jab needs to be administered to at least 95% of the population, the WHO says - a level not reached in the endemic countries. Children should be screened for their measles vaccination history when they start school, and those lacking evidence of receipt of two doses should be vaccinated, the WHO says.",Saturday 27 May 2017,27-May-17,Germany gets tough on child vaccination,"Parents could be fined up to €2,500 if they fail to see a doctor about vaccinating their children.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40056680
"Wonder Woman women-only screenings in Texas spark row A cinema chain in Austin, Texas, has caused uproar after scheduling women-only screenings of Wonder Woman. The big-budget superhero film, which stars Gal Gadot, is set for US release on 2 June. And on 6 June, the Alamo Drafthouse has reserved two showings for those who identify as female. ""The most iconic superheroine in comic book history finally has her own movie, and what better way to celebrate?"" organisers said. A post on the Alamo's website read: ""Apologies, gentlemen, but we're embracing our girl power and saying 'No Guys Allowed' for one special night at the Alamo Ritz.  ""And when we say 'People Who Identify As Women Only', we mean it. Everyone working at this screening - venue staff, projectionist, and culinary team - will be female. ""So lasso your geeky girlfriends together and grab your tickets to this celebration of one of the most enduring and inspiring characters ever created."" Now unimpressed men are lambasting the idea on Facebook, claiming they are being discriminated against. ""Great, let us know when you have guys-only screenings of Thor, Spider-Man, Star Wars, etc. Let's see you walk the walk now that you set this precedence [sic],"" one man wrote. ""Very sorry if you feel excluded,"" came the reply on the cinema's official account. ""We thought it might be kinda fun ... to celebrate a character who's meant a great deal to women for close to eight decades. Again, truly, truly, truly, truly sorry that we've offended you."" ""Have you ever hosted a men's only showing of any film?"" Facebook user Bill Fairbrother enquired. The cinema chain cheerfully responded: ""We've never done showings where you had to be a man to get in, but we *did* show the Entourage movie a few years ago."" When another critic asked if there would be a men-only screening, the cinema posted a link on how to set up a private event, advising, ""Go for it!"" But if some men objected, others embraced the move as within the spirit of the film, which is the first DC superhero outing with a female director - Patty Jenkins - and title character. ""I am a man and fully support this,"" said one fan. ""This is a great idea and I will see it another time! Wow, that was easier than deciding to feel persecuted!"" wrote Geoff Stark. As the women-only screenings have proved hugely popular, the Alamo now plans to extend the format across the US. According to Mashable, the Dallas, Austin, and DC branches will donate proceeds from their ticket sales to local women's charities.",Saturday 27 May 2017,27-May-17,Row over Wonder Woman women-only shows,Men claim discrimination after a cinema scheduled women-only screenings of the superhero film.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40058986
"Legal victory for Kenya hunter-gatherers Hunter-gatherers in Kenya have won an eight-year court battle against the government's plan to evict them from their ancestral land in the Mau Forest.  The Ogiek were entitled to live on their ancestral land and the government should not have tried to evict them, a pan-African court ruled. Campaigners hailed the ruling as a huge victory for indigenous communities. The government had argued that the hunter-gatherers needed to be evicted to protect the indigenous forest.  But the African Court of Human and People's Rights ruled that the government had violated a series of rights of the Ogiek people, including the right to property and the right to practise their culture in the forest in western Kenya. Environmental degradation in the Mau Forest had been caused mainly by ""ill-advised"" logging concessions and settlement by non-Ogiek people,  Justice Augustino Ramadhani said, according to Reuters news agency. The ruling affects some 35, 000 traditional hunters who live in the forest, some 200km (125 miles) from the capital, Nairobi.    ""They are one of the last remaining forest-dwelling communities and among the most marginalised indigenous peoples in Kenya,"" said Minority Rights Group International.  ""For the Ogiek, this is history in the making. The issue of Ogiek land rights has finally been heard and the case has empowered them to feel relevant,"" it added in a statement. One community member, 96-year-old Rashamba Debola, told the BBC she had lived in the forest all her life.  ""I grew up here, married traditionally, had my family here, buried my husband in this forest. I don't know anywhere else. For now, I live here with my great-grandchildren. I would love to see them carry on our traditions.""  Amnesty International said the hunter-gatherers had fought for a long time in the Kenyan courts, before turning to the pan-African court to achieve justice.   ""Today's ruling is a historic victory for the Ogiek community, and gives hope to all indigenous peoples everywhere,"" it said in a statement.  ""But a ruling is not enough, it must be respected. The Kenyan government must now implement the ruling and let the Ogiek live freely on their ancestral land.""

"Burundi orders couples to wed amid drive to 'moralise society' Cohabiting couples in Burundi have until the end of the year to get married or face legal consequences. The government order comes after President Pierre Nkurunziza launched a campaign ""to moralise society"". A government spokesman said a crackdown on informal relationships was needed to combat a population explosion. He said too many schoolgirls were getting pregnant and men were taking advantage of women by cohabiting with several simultaneously. Burundi has been in crisis since 2015 when Mr Nkurunziza, a born-again Christian, announced he would run for a controversial third term. Interior ministry spokesman Terence Ntahiraja told AFP news agency that church and state-sanctioned weddings were the solution to the country's population explosion - and a patriotic duty. ""We want Burundians to understand that everyone is responsible for his life, we want order in this country,"" he said. ""All this is done within the framework of the patriotic training programme,"" he said, referring to an initiative launched by President Nkurunziza. It is not clear exactly what sanctions those not tying the knot will face. However, one farmer quoted by AFP said local officials had already threatened him and his partner with a fine and said any child born out of wedlock would not qualify for free education or medical treatment. The farmer, named only as Pierre, said he had not married because he could not afford the bride price demanded by his partner's family. Hundreds of people have since died since Mr Nkurunziza launched a bid for a third term.

"Sea lion attack: Girl treated over 'seal finger' risk A girl dragged off a dock in Canada by a sea lion is being treated with antibiotics because of the risk of a dangerous infection. Vancouver Aquarium said it had been contacted by the girl's family after staff had raised concerns about ""seal finger"", which can lead to amputations. The girl suffered a 10cm (4in) wound when the animal grabbed her with its jaws, her father told CBC News. He rejected claims that she had been trying to feed the marine mammal. The video of her being pulled by the dress from the dockside in Richmond, British Columbia, and then rescued by her grandfather, has been widely shared on social media, prompting some users to suggest the family had  been trying to feed sea lions. ""There was somebody beside them that was trying to feed them,"" said the father, who gave only his surname, Lau, in order to prevent the identification of the girl. But he admitted his daughter had got too near when she moved forwards to have a closer look. ""That's a lesson she took and she has taken that lesson in a hard way,"" he said. Aquarium spokesman Deana Lancaster told ABC news the family had got in touch after staff gave interviews about the risks of ""seal finger"" infection. Bacteria living in the mouths of seals and sea lions can cause the painful and potentially serious condition, with symptoms including cellulitis and debilitating joint inflammation. It is mainly known historically for affecting sealers' hands, although it can travel to any part of the body. Ms Lancaster said the girl was now going to get the right treatment. Mr Lau confirmed the family had been in touch with the aquarium and praised the girl's grandfather's quick response. ""If he had a one- or two-second doubt about that, my girl could have been gone by then. That reaction makes him a hero,"" he said. He said the family had been ""disturbed"" by the video going viral, but were mainly just relieved the girl was safe. ""Only thing I care is: God, she is safe,"" said Mr Lau.

Her father, Gavin Bell (also known as author Mason Cross), revealed on Twitter that she had gone rogue on a pupil feedback form. She criticised the policy of punishing a whole class for one person's bad behaviour - by citing the Geneva Conventions.  ""Not sure if I should ground her or buy her ice cream,"" Mr Bell mused. Asked what her teacher could do better, Ava Bell wrote: ""Not use collective punishment as it is not fair on the many people who did nothing and under the 1949 Genva [sic] Conventions it is a war crime.""

"Portland deaths: Son who died trying to stop Muslim abuse 'a hero' The mother of a US man who died protecting two young women from anti-Muslim harassment has called him ""a hero"" who ""will remain a hero"" after his death. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche was one of two men who were stabbed to death on a train on Friday in Portland, Oregon. Police named the other man who died as Ricky John Best, 53, a father of four and an Army veteran. Another passenger was wounded before the attacker was arrested. Police have identified the suspect as Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, a convicted felon. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday, charged with two counts of aggravated murder, attempted murder, intimidation and being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon.  However, Loren Cannon, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Oregon, said on Saturday it was too early to tell whether the ""violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime"". On Friday afternoon, two teenage girls, one of them Muslim and wearing a headscarf, boarded a train in Portland. According to witnesses, they attracted the attention of Mr Christian. Dyjuana Hudson - mother to one of the girls - said he began ""saying all Muslims should die"". Sergeant Pete Simpson confirmed the ""suspect was on the train and he was yelling and ranting and raving a lot of different things, including what would be characterised as hate speech or biased language"". Three men then stepped in to help the girls. Ms Hudson told the Oregonian that one of them said: ""You can't get at them like that — they're little girls."" But the suspect then allegedly turned on the girls' defenders. Sgt Simpson said: ""Some of the people that he was yelling at, they were attacked viciously by the suspect, resulting in the two deaths and one injury."" Apparently unaware of how badly injured their defenders were, the two terrified girls fled, calling Ms Hudson for help. Mr Christian was arrested shortly after he got off the train. Mr Best was on his way home when he was attacked. He had spent 23 years serving in the US Army, retiring in 2012, according to the Oregon website Willamette Week. Since 2015, he had worked for the City of Portland. His colleague Kareen Perkins told Oregon Live he was ""the first person you would go to for help"". Mr Namkai-Meche was on the phone to his aunt when the suspect confronted the girls. Mr Namkai-Meche's aunt urged the economics graduate to get off the phone and film what was happening, KATU News reported. ""I didn't mean for him to try to be a hero and get himself killed but he was trying to protect those two teenage girls,"" she told the television station. Mr Namkai-Meche's mother paid tribute to her ""dear baby boy"" on Facebook. ""He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil,"" she wrote. ""Shining bright star I love you forever."" Ms Hudson, the mother of one of the girls, wrote on Facebook: ""Thank you thank you thank you... You will always be our hero."" The injured victim, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, remains in hospital. Portland mayor Ted Wheeler said the ""brave and selfless actions"" of the three men ""should serve as an example and inspiration to us all"". However, speaking at a press conference, he warned ""the current political climate allows far too much room for those who spread bigotry"". A senior researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-attack monitoring group, said Mr Christian's Facebook page said he held ""some racist and other extremist beliefs"". His Facebook page also said he liked ""comix"" and ""cannabis"". An article in a Portland local alternative publication reported that he was a ""known white supremacist"" who had previously given a Nazi salute at a right-wing march.

"British Airways: Chaos continues at Heathrow More than a third of British Airways flights from Heathrow were cancelled as thousands of passengers faced a second day of disruption. The airline was hit by a worldwide computer system power failure on Saturday, causing cancellations and delays for thousands of passengers.  All long-haul services left from Heathrow, but with delays, BA said. The airline has urged people to check the status of flights before travelling to the airport. The airline apologised to customers for the issue, which is thought to have been caused by a problem with the IT system's power supply. In a statement released on Sunday, chief executive Alex Cruz said: ""I know this has been a horrible time for customers. We're not there yet, but we are doing our very best to sort things out for you."" The BBC's Phillip Norton, who has been stranded at Rome airport since Saturday, has been told he won't be able to fly back to London until Tuesday.   The airline is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel costs.  Customers displaced by flight cancellations can claim up to £200 a day for a room (based on two people sharing), £50 for transport between the hotel and airport, and £25 a day per adult for meals and refreshments. One traveller from Seattle said she had spent the evening sleeping on the floor of a hotel conference room.  Ashley Tracey, who was trying to get to Mumbai for her friend's wedding, said she had been queuing to rebook her flight for six hours. She said: ""There's no information I can't seem to get through online, I don't live here so I don't have a phone that works here."" by James Goldburn, BBC News, at Heathrow On Sunday morning, Heathrow Terminal 5 descended into chaos again as people arrived to rebook flights after theirs were cancelled yesterday as well as new arrivals hoping they had not been affected by the company's IT failure.  Many people told me about the lack of knowledge or information provided by BA staff.  One American woman on a stop-over described how an employee asked what the queue they were standing in was for.  Some passengers slept on yoga mats provided by the airline as conference rooms were opened to provide somewhere more comfortable to rest.  A number of people arrived at the airport for 05:00 and were still none the wiser by lunch time whether they'd be home any time soon.  As the day has progressed, British Airways appears to have more of a grip on the situation. The departure lounge has calmed down and many have rearranged their flights.  But the terminal is still full of hour-long queues and for many this wasn't how they had hoped to spend their Bank Holiday weekend.  There have been reports that some passengers who departed from Heathrow on Saturday found their luggage was not at their destination when they landed. Terry Page, 28, arrived in Fort Worth, Texas after delays and said ""about 50"" passengers did not have their check-in luggage.  Thousands of bags remain at Heathrow Airport, but BA has advised passengers not to return to collect them, saying they will be couriered to customers.  The airport also said passengers whose flights were cancelled should not travel to Heathrow unless they have already rebooked their flight.  A spokesman said staff were ""continuing to give passengers free water and snacks"". On Saturday passengers described ""chaotic"" scenes at the airports, with some criticising BA for a lack of information. The airline apologised and said it was refunding and rebooking customers. The company's chief executive Alex Cruz had said it was believed ""the root cause [of the computer problems] was a power supply issue"". The company said there was no evidence the failure was the result of a cyber attack. The IT failure affected check-in and operational systems, including customer service phone lines.

"Manchester attack: CCTV shows bomber before arena blast CCTV images showing suicide bomber Salman Abedi on the night he attacked the Manchester Arena killing 22 people have been released by police.  Fourteen locations are being searched and 13 men are in custody on suspicion of terror offences. Abedi's identity was known within two hours of Monday's attack, police said. The latest person to be arrested was a 19-year-old man in the Gorton area of Manchester. A 25-year-old man was held earlier in the Old Trafford area. Searches are ongoing in the city's Rusholme and Gorton areas. Armed police continue to guard hundreds of events across the UK over the bank holiday weekend.  Additional security measures were in place for the Great Manchester Run, where tens of thousands of runners took part, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham. The second day of Radio 1's Big Weekend in Hull is also subject to extra security. The UK threat level has been reduced from critical to severe and soldiers deployed to support the police will be gradually withdrawn from Monday night. Prime Minister Theresa May made the announcement after leading a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Saturday morning. Mrs May said significant activity by the police during the last 24 hours had led to the threat being reduced. It is unclear where the newly released images of Abedi were taken and from what time on Monday evening. Greater Manchester Police have made an appeal to the public for information about the bomber's movements since 18 May, when he returned to the UK.  Abedi's city centre flat was one of the last places he went - and where he may have made the final touches to his explosive device - before going to the arena, police have said. Police said the investigation - which is ""making good progress"" - has around 1,000 people working on it and hundreds more officers involved in the security across Greater Manchester. In total 15 people have been arrested in Greater Manchester, Warwickshire and Merseyside - but a woman and a 16-year-old boy were later released without charge. Seven children were among those who died when the Manchester-born 22-year-old detonated the bomb on Monday night, at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. A vigil is being held for 29-year-old victim Martyn Hett at Heaton Moor Park in Stockport on Sunday evening. And the family of student Georgina Callander, from Lancashire, have said she was ""as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside, with a smile that was never ending. She always had big hugs for everyone and her life was blooming like the flowers she loved"". In a statement issued through Greater Manchester Police, they said her life was ""taken away after 18 short years by evil, evil men prepared to ruin lives and destroy families, for what?"" They added: ""I wish I could say that Georgina is one of the last to die in this way but unless our government opens its eyes we know we are only another in a long line of parents on a list that continues to grow."" Anyone with information is asked to call the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789321.

"Gregg Allman, rock trailblazer, dies at 69 Rock trailblazer Gregg Allman, a founding member of The Allman Brothers Band, has died age 69. Allman died at home in Savannah, Georgia, on Saturday, his official website announced. The musician first found fame in the band he started with older brother Duane in the late 1960s. In its heyday, the band was a staple on radio stations and released albums ranked among the best in rock history. Allman, the band's lead singer and keyboardist, wrote several of their biggest hits, including Whipping Post, It's Not My Cross to Bear and Midnight Rider. Among The Allman Brothers Band's best-known songs is Jessica, from 1973, which was used as the opening theme tune to Top Gear. After news of his death was announced, singer Cher, to whom he was married in the 1970s, tweeted ""words are impossible"", before sharing a picture of the two together. The band's first three albums made them stars, but then tragedy struck when Duane - whose talent as a guitarist was revered in the rock industry - died in a motorcycle accident aged 24 in 1971. A little more than a year later, bassist Berry Oakley was also killed in a motorcycle accident. Allman would go on to struggle with drug abuse, becoming a heroin addict in the 1970s. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, but said in his 2012 memoir My Cross to Bear he was too drunk to enjoy the ceremony. After his death, singer Cher, who he was married to in the 1970s, tweeted ""words are impossible"", before sharing a picture of the two together. Allman was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1999 and underwent a liver transplant in 2010.

"Schapelle Corby: 'Ganja Queen' trafficker deported from Bali Convicted Australian drug trafficker Schapelle Corby has returned to Brisbane after nine years in prison and three years on parole in Indonesia. The former beauty therapist was arrested in 2004 at Bali airport with 4.2kg of marijuana hidden in surfing gear, and sentenced the next year. Her case affected foreign relations between Australia and Indonesia and outraged many Australians, with some viewing her sentence as too harsh. She proclaimed innocence throughout. Hundreds of police officers were deployed to assist with Corby's departure. Her sister Mercedes, who lives in Indonesia, shielded her from journalists' cameras as they walked to a car. Corby then posted a video on Instagram of the media scrum seen behind the vehicle's tinted windows.  She was taken in a convoy from her Bali villa to the airport, to catch a flight to Brisbane. Upon her landing, at about 05:00 on Sunday local time (19:00 Saturday GMT), she and her sister were reportedly ushered to a waiting convoy of vans. Corby has also posted a picture of her dogs on her new Instagram account, saying she would miss them. Indonesia's drug laws are much stricter than Australia's with no distinction being drawn between marijuana and other drugs including heroin and cocaine.  In 2015 two other Australians were executed after being found guilty of smuggling drugs. In February 2014, Schapelle Corby, arguably Australia's most infamous overseas prisoner, was released from Bali's Kerobokan jail, but she was forced to remain on the Indonesian holiday island as part of her parole. For the past three years, she has lived quietly with her Indonesian boyfriend in relative anonymity in the tourist hub of Kuta, swimming and jogging on the beach with the occasional night out. Life back home as a convicted drug trafficker in Queensland will, however, be very different. Here, Corby is a household name and, certainly in the short term, she will be pursued relentlessly by the media. When she was arrested 13 years ago she became a national obsession, and so she remains.  Australia is still divided; is she guilty or, as she continues to claim, the victim of a conspiracy involving corrupt baggage handlers who planted more than 4kg of cannabis in her luggage?  There is no such debate in Indonesia, however. There, the former beauty therapist is seen simply as a common criminal. In Australia Corby has commanded public sympathy as local media followed her struggles with mental illness behind bars. However in Indonesia she is seen as a criminal. Bali corrections chief Surung Pasaribu said: ""We will pray for her that she will repent. God wants humans to return to the right path."" Ms Corby's sentence was cut by five years after an appeal to the Indonesian president, and she also received several remissions for good behaviour. Although she was released from prison in 2014, she could not leave Bali under her parole conditions for three years. Corby was the subject of a 2007 documentary, ""Ganja Queen"".",Sunday 28 May 2017,28-May-17,Australia 'Ganja Queen' deported from Bali,Schapelle Corby was jailed for marijuana smuggling in a case which caused outrage in Australia.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-40071279

"G7 talks: Trump isolated over Paris climate change deal Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations have failed to agree a statement on climate change. Six world leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris accord, the world's first comprehensive deal aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions. However, the US has refused to recommit to the agreement, saying it will make a decision next week. Mr Trump, who once dismissed global warming as a ""hoax"", has previously threatened to pull out of the accord. The Axios news site, quoting three sources, later reported that Mr Trump had told members of his inner circle that the US will withdraw from the Paris agreement. This is Mr Trump's first G7 summit - during his first foreign trip. G7 leaders from the US, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan have agreed a statement on fighting terrorism. 'America first' and cultural mishaps The final communique issued at the G7 summit in Italy said the US ""is in the process of reviewing its policies on climate change and on the Paris Agreement and thus is not in a position to join the consensus on these topics"". However, the other G7 leaders pledged to ""reaffirm their strong commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the discussion on climate change had been ""very unsatisfactory"", adding ""we have a situation of six against one"". Mr Trump tweeted: ""I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!""  His economic adviser, Gary Cohn, said Mr Trump ""came here to learn. He came here to get smart. His views are evolving... exactly as they should be."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who is also in Sicily for the meeting, told the BBC earlier that the accord would survive regardless of Mr Trump's position. There is a new fault line within the G7. An informal G6 (Canada, Japan, the UK, France, Germany, Italy) faces an informal G1 - the US.  The drafters of the summit's final communique had no way of hiding the division which exists on climate change.  The statement noted simply that six countries remained committed to the Paris agreement while the US was in the process of evaluating its participation.  In his closing news conference, Italy's Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni was unable to hide his disappointment with the lack of agreement. On this subject, the G1 acts alone. The G7 has been a champion of free trade since its inception. The leaders' last summit in Japan last year stressed the need to avoid protectionism. But this was before the election of Donald Trump and his campaign slogan of ""America First"". German weekly Der Spiegel quoted Mr Trump as saying in a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday that Germans were ""very bad"" regarding car exports to the US. However, all G7 leaders agreed to back the final communique which pledged to ""fight protectionism"", while acknowledging that ""trade has not always worked to the benefit of everyone"". Leaders from Tunisia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Niger and Nigeria took part in the discussions in Sicilian town Taormina earlier on Saturday. Italy is keen to encourage the world's wealthiest nations to support African countries in developing their economies, so fewer young people will feel forced to make the dangerous journey to Europe. However, a diplomat told Reuters that other Italian proposals - which looked to highlight the benefits of migration and promote a major initiative on food security - were dismissed ahead of the summit. According to the source, Mr Trump's administration was unwilling to highlight benefits of human mobility, Reuters reported. A statement originally intended to be separate and run into several pages has now been condensed to two paragraphs. So far this year, more than 1,500 migrants are thought to have drowned in the Mediterranean. Mr Trump described his first foreign trip as ""a truly historic week for our country"" and said he was ""more hopeful than ever that nations of many faiths... can join together in common cause"" in fighting terrorism. He is now returning to the US, where his approval ratings are low. US media have already been casting judgement: Headlines in the US continue to be dominated by alleged Russian meddling in November's election, and there are whisperings of discontent within his own party over policy decisions. Making his first foreign trip as president, he came to Sicily from Brussels where he had held talks with EU and Nato leaders. At Nato headquarters, he complained that many Nato member states were not spending enough on defence, expecting the US to bear the burden. Before that, he visited Pope Francis in Rome and toured the Middle East - first Saudi Arabia, then Israel and the Palestinian territories.",Sunday 28 May 2017,28-May-17,Trump isolated at G7 talks over climate,"Germany called the climate change talks ""very unsatisfactory"", describing them as ""six against one"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40069636

"Trump team brush off Kushner 'secret Russia line' questions Senior US advisers have refused to answer questions about Donald Trump's son-in-law, following reports that Jared Kushner tried to set up a secret communication line with Moscow. National Security Adviser HR McMaster said backchannel communications between different governments were normal.  Economic adviser Gary Cohn said: ""We're not going to comment on Jared.""

"Philippines' Duterte under fire for second rape joke The president of the Philippines has come under fire for joking about rape in a speech to soldiers. While speaking at a military camp after imposing martial law across the south of the country, he said they were allowed to rape up to three women. This was the second rape joke Rodrigo Duterte has been condemned for making since announcing his candidacy. A human rights group said his comment was ""sickening"" and Chelsea Clinton tweeted that rape was never funny. Mr Duterte's words were: ""I will be imprisoned for you. If you rape three (women), I will say that I did it. But if you marry four, son of a whore you will be beaten up."" Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of former president Bill Clinton and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, wrote on Twitter that Mr Duterte was ""a murderous thug with no regard for human rights"" and that ""rape is never a joke"". Phelim Kine of Human Rights Watch said the president's comment was ""a sickening attempt at humour"" that sent soldiers a signal they could commit rights abuses while enforcing martial law. He said: ""Duterte's pro-rape comments only confirm some of the worst fears of human rights activists that the Duterte government will not just turn a blind eye to possible military abuses in Mindanao, but may actively encourage them."" And a women's political party in the country, Gabriela, said in a statement: ""Rape is not a joke. Martial law and the heightened vulnerability to military abuse that it brings to women and children are not a joke either."" Martial law was imposed last week on Mindanao in the south of the Philippines, where Muslim separatists and other rebels are fighting the army. Last year, Mr Duterte joked about a 1989 rape and murder of an Australian missionary. He said that as mayor of the town where it happened, he should have been ""first in line"".

"Sri Lanka floods: Nearly 500,000 displaced as death toll rises At least 126 people have been killed and nearly 500,000 displaced in Sri Lanka following flooding and mudslides triggered by monsoon rains, the government says. A further 97 people are still missing, a spokesman said. Military boats and helicopters have been sent to help rescue operations. The flooding is believed to be the worst since May 2003 when a similarly powerful south-west monsoon destroyed 10,000 homes and killed 250 people. Rescuers had set up 185 camps for displaced people and the town of Matara in the south of the island was being evacuated because of the risk of flooding, the spokesman said. Earlier, the head of military rescue operations Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe told the BBC that troops had reached all the affected areas and the risk to life had receded. ""There is no danger to life now, it is a matter of providing food, water and looking into sanitation,"" he said. One of the worst affected areas was the south-western district of Kalutara.

"Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea By Phil McNulty Chief football writer at Wembley Stadium 
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Arsene Wenger secured his record seventh FA Cup final win as Arsenal produced a magnificent display to win a Wembley thriller against 10-man Chelsea. Alexis Sanchez gave Arsenal the lead in contentious fashion after only four minutes, when referee Anthony Taylor overruled his assistant after he had flagged for offside against Aaron Ramsey. The Premier League champions also claimed Sanchez handled in the build-up. And their task became even harder when Victor Moses was correctly sent off by Taylor in the second half after receiving a second yellow card for diving. Diego Costa revived Chelsea's hopes of a repeat of their league and FA Cup double in 2010 when Arsenal keeper David Ospina failed to keep out his deflected shot with 14 minutes left. Arsenal, outstanding throughout, refused to be denied and were back in front inside three minutes when Ramsey, who scored the FA Cup final winner against Hull City in 2014, did it again with a header from substitute Olivier Giroud's cross. Wenger pumped his fists in delight at the final whistle, as a season that has brought so much criticism for the 67-year-old ended in Wembley glory with a record 13th FA Cup win for the Gunners - and a record seventh for the Frenchman. Former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on BBC Radio 5 live: Arsene Wenger was right when he said the season has been a tough one for the players and fans, but they turned up today. They had one mindset, to walk off as winners, and that was clear to see. They played the better football and wanted it more. The Chelsea players were hanging their heads but they had an unbelievable season. On the day, not enough players turned up, they did not deserve to win. Arsenal defender Rob Holding had a fantastic semi-final too and he was under the spotlight, as was Per Mertesacker. Both players put on a huge display. What a performance Mesut Ozil put in too. Man for man, they were much better than Chelsea. I cannot believe how ordinary Arsenal made Chelsea look. The Premier League champions could not handle Arsenal's footballing ability in the middle of the pitch. They could not get any rhythm or get on the ball. It was their best display of the season. 
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Wenger finally gave full vent to his feelings about the criticism he received this season in the Wembley build-up - describing it as ""a disgrace"" he will ""never forget."" And here at Wembley he answered the critics eloquently as Arsenal delivered an outstanding performance in an enthralling final to secure a win they fully merited. It was all done in front of Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke, a staunch supporter of his manager in the face of mounting criticism, and with a decision still pending on Wenger's future. Wenger's stock has fallen in the eyes of Arsenal fans as the team have struggled at times this season, failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. Here however, Wenger coaxed and cajoled an inspired 90 minutes out of his Arsenal side in a performance that can rank alongside their finest in recent seasons. Danny Welbeck and Aaron Ramsey both hit the woodwork in a matter of seconds in the first half and Ozil struck it deep in the second half. Chelsea defender Gary Cahill also made two excellent clearances as Arsenal created enough chances to win comfortably. Wenger, watching throughout in shirtsleeves, looked remarkably calm given the prize on offer and how much was riding on this Wembley final for him and his reputation. Arsenal were sharper, more aggressive and more creative than Chelsea - their only anxiety coming when they led by just one goal after a first 45 minutes they dominated completely. And The Gunners even refused to be knocked off course when Chelsea, reduced to 10 men after Moses' sending off, were gifted an equaliser when Ospina pushed feebly at Costa's deflected shot in the 76th minute. If Wenger needed to produce evidence that he can still win the big prizes and still get his Arsenal side to produce the big performance, then this was it. Wenger was effectively forced to plunge veteran German defender Per Mertesacker into action after only 37 minutes playing time this season as he wrestled with a defensive crisis - and how the 32-year-old rewarded him. The Gunners were without suspended Laurent Koscielny, injured Gabriel and Shkodran Mustafi, who was suffering from concussion. It meant a call-up for Mertesacker against the most demanding Premier League opponents of all. He was faultless throughout, giving a masterclass in positioning, timing and making crucial interceptions time after time in a display that made a mockery of his lack of action. Mertesacker made experience count as he subdued Costa, apart from a moment when he got a slight deflection on his equaliser, but the embrace he received from his manager at the final whistle told the story. Chelsea went into this final as firm favourites to claim the league and cup double against an Arsenal side who have been their inferior this season. But in the end it was just one game too far for Antonio Conte's men. They looked leg-weary and slow and key men such as Eden Hazard and N'Golo Kante were unable to exert their usual influence. The Blues threatened to demonstrate their durability and resilience once more when, even at a numerical disadvantage, Costa put them back in the game. It was not to be - and the brutal truth is that on the day they were outplayed by a resurgent Arsenal. This has still been an outstanding season for Conte's side. The referee was presented with two big FA Cup final decisions - and he was certainly not found to be lacking in conviction. He overruled his linesman for Sanchez's opening goal after the offside flag had been raised, although Chelsea were left nursing a serious sense of injustice as they believed the Chilean had handled. There was no question he got his second decision right, giving a second yellow card to Moses as he clearly dived in a desperate attempt to win a penalty as Chelsea chased an equaliser. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: ""We had an outstanding performance from the first minute onwards. This team has suffered. They've united and responded. They showed strength and unity and played spectacular football today. ""I'm proud to have won seven of these cups. I'm proud having done this - winning the championship without losing and winning seven FA Cups."" Chelsea manager Antonio Conte: ""I think the first goal was very strange. The first half we didn't start well, we didn't have the right approach and we suffered in first 25 minutes. We started to play better in the second half and the red card was decisive. ""There is disappointment for the final result but it can happen and there was a lot of pressure. Victor Moses has been good and played an important season. ""Our season was incredible to win the league in this way, it was great but now it's important to look forward and to restart"".

"Manchester attacks: MI5 probes bomber 'warnings' MI5 is to hold an inquiry into the way it dealt with warnings from the public that the Manchester suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was a potential threat.   The security service, which was alerted to Abedi's extremist views three times prior to last Monday's attack, will examine how it dealt with the warnings. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was right for MI5 to review its processes. Early on Monday a man, 23, was arrested in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, on suspicion of terrorism offences. Officers from Greater Manchester Police also began searching a site in Pilsworth near Bury on Monday afternoon. On Sunday, two men were arrested in Manchester - a 19-year-old man in Gorton and a 25-year-old man in the Old Trafford area.   In all, 14 men are now being questioned in connection with the investigation into the attack. Searches were also carried out at addresses in the Whalley Range area of Manchester and in Chester on Sunday night.  Seven children were among the 22 people who died when Abedi detonated a bomb on 22 May at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena.   NHS England said 52 people were still being treated in hospital - including 19 in critical care. Manchester Victoria station will reopen on Tuesday, just over a week after the suicide attack, British Transport Police have said.  The station, which is connected to Manchester Arena where the bomb went off, suffered structural damage in the incident.  MI5 has launched a ""post incident investigation"" into how the Manchester bomber was overlooked, while a separate report is being prepared for ministers and those who oversee the work of the service.  A Whitehall official said previously that Abedi was one of a ""pool"" of former subjects of interest whose risk remained ""subject to review"" by the security service and its partners. Born in Manchester to Libyan parents. BBC Newsnight reported that when Abedi was 16 he fought against the Colonel Gaddafi regime with his father during the school holidays. It was while at Manchester College that two people who knew Abedi have confirmed they made separate calls to an anti-terrorism hotline to warn the police about his extremist views. One of the mosques attended by Abedi and his family in Didsbury, south Manchester, has said it has a ""lot to learn"" to deter young people from extremist ideologies. Greater Manchester Police have made an appeal to the public for information about Abedi's movements since 18 May, when he returned to the UK from abroad.  The home secretary would not comment specifically on what the security service knew about Abedi, but insisted it was right for MI5 to review its processes because ""the threat is always changing"". The Times is reporting that a ""key"" tool which gives law enforcement the power to stop Britons suspected of involvement in terrorist activity abroad at the UK border has only been used once since it was introduced in 2015. Ms Rudd said it was not for her to demand that a certain number of Temporary Exclusion Orders be used, but to make sure the security service has the ""tools they can use"" to protect the public. ""We need to put our efforts into protecting young people,"" she told BBC News. ""People in our communities who are being targeted by Daesh [the Islamic State terror group] and fed a false ideology."" She said the government had ""never understated"" the threat of a terror attack in the UK, adding: ""We have to level with people."" Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives the police the power to stop, search and hold individuals at ports, airports and international railway stations. Initially individuals could be questioned for up to nine hours - although a change in the guidelines means it is now up to six hours. The police also have the power to inspect electronic devices such as phones and laptops. The police also have the power to seize travel documents for up to 14 days if they believe someone is travelling in order to engage in terrorist activity. Another option is a Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO), which can be used against British citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activity abroad. They are designed to stop suspects from re-entering the UK unless they give themselves up at the border.  Read more from Reality Check  Police say their investigation is ""making good progress"" and has around 1,000 people working on it. In total 16 people have been arrested - but a woman and a 16-year-old boy were later released without charge. The UK threat level has been reduced from critical to severe and soldiers deployed to support the police will be gradually withdrawn from Monday night. Additional security measures were in place for the Great Manchester Run on Sunday, which attracted tens of thousands of participants. A huge round of applause for the emergency services followed a minute's silence for the victims and casualties. There was also higher security at weekend events such as the FA Cup final in London.

"Merkel: Europe 'can no longer rely on allies' after Trump and Brexit Europe can no longer ""completely depend"" on the US and UK following the election of President Trump and Brexit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel says. Mrs Merkel said she wanted friendly relations with both countries as well as Russia but Europeans had to ""take their destiny into their own hands"". Her comments come after Mr Trump refused to re-commit to the 2015 Paris climate deal at the G7 summit. Mrs Merkel is on the campaign trail ahead of elections in September. ""The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days,"" Mrs Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany. The relationship between Berlin and new French President Emmanuel Macron had to be a priority, Mrs Merkel said, adding: ""We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands."" On Saturday, the German leader had described climate change talks at the G7 group of rich nations as ""very unsatisfactory"". Leaders from the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan had re-affirmed their support for the Paris accord - but Mr Trump said he would make a decision in the coming week. Mr Trump has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal, and expressed doubts about climate change. Speaking in Brussels last week, Mr Trump also told Nato members to spend more money on defence and did not re-state his administration's commitment to Nato's mutual security guarantees. Mrs Merkel's latest comments are partly a move to appeal to German voters first and foremost, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Polls suggest Mrs Merkel is on course to be re-elected for a fourth term as German chancellor at elections in September.  It might have been thanks to the beer, pretzels and Bavarian brass-band enlivening the crowd.  But Mrs Merkel's words were uncharacteristically passionate and unusually forthright. By all means keep friendly relations with Trump's America and Brexit Britain, was the message - but we can't rely on them.  Rapturous applause greeted her fiery calls for Europeans to fight for their own destiny.  No wonder she's sounding confident. France has a new president who shares her pro free-trade, Europhile values, so there is a positive feeling in Europe that the EU's Franco-German motor is back in business.  With four months to go before elections, Angela Merkel's position also looks stronger than ever domestically. Initial enthusiasm for her centre-left rival Martin Schulz has fizzled out. And Sunday's beer-tent event underscored her strength by marking an end to a potential split with her Bavarian sister conservative party.  She might not have welcomed Brexit or Trump. But it seems that Mrs Merkel has decided that standing up for the EU will only strengthen her chances of winning another term in September.

"British Airways: Chaos continues at Heathrow More than a third of British Airways flights from Heathrow were cancelled as thousands of passengers faced a second day of disruption. The airline was hit by a worldwide computer system power failure on Saturday, causing cancellations and delays for thousands of passengers.  All long-haul services left from Heathrow, but with delays, BA said. The airline has urged people to check the status of flights before travelling to the airport. The airline apologised to customers for the issue, which is thought to have been caused by a problem with the IT system's power supply. In a statement released on Sunday, chief executive Alex Cruz said: ""I know this has been a horrible time for customers. We're not there yet, but we are doing our very best to sort things out for you."" The BBC's Phillip Norton, who has been stranded at Rome airport since Saturday, has been told he won't be able to fly back to London until Tuesday.   The airline is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel costs.  Customers displaced by flight cancellations can claim up to £200 a day for a room (based on two people sharing), £50 for transport between the hotel and airport, and £25 a day per adult for meals and refreshments. One traveller from Seattle said she had spent the evening sleeping on the floor of a hotel conference room.  Ashley Tracey, who was trying to get to Mumbai for her friend's wedding, said she had been queuing to rebook her flight for six hours. She said: ""There's no information I can't seem to get through online, I don't live here so I don't have a phone that works here."" by James Goldburn, BBC News, at Heathrow On Sunday morning, Heathrow Terminal 5 descended into chaos again as people arrived to rebook flights after theirs were cancelled yesterday as well as new arrivals hoping they had not been affected by the company's IT failure.  Many people told me about the lack of knowledge or information provided by BA staff.  One American woman on a stop-over described how an employee asked what the queue they were standing in was for.  Some passengers slept on yoga mats provided by the airline as conference rooms were opened to provide somewhere more comfortable to rest.  A number of people arrived at the airport for 05:00 and were still none the wiser by lunch time whether they'd be home any time soon.  As the day has progressed, British Airways appears to have more of a grip on the situation. The departure lounge has calmed down and many have rearranged their flights.  But the terminal is still full of hour-long queues and for many this wasn't how they had hoped to spend their Bank Holiday weekend.  There have been reports that some passengers who departed from Heathrow on Saturday found their luggage was not at their destination when they landed. Terry Page, 28, arrived in Fort Worth, Texas after delays and said ""about 50"" passengers did not have their check-in luggage.  Thousands of bags remain at Heathrow Airport, but BA has advised passengers not to return to collect them, saying they will be couriered to customers.  The airport also said passengers whose flights were cancelled should not travel to Heathrow unless they have already rebooked their flight.  A spokesman said staff were ""continuing to give passengers free water and snacks"". On Saturday passengers described ""chaotic"" scenes at the airports, with some criticising BA for a lack of information. The airline apologised and said it was refunding and rebooking customers. The company's chief executive Alex Cruz had said it was believed ""the root cause [of the computer problems] was a power supply issue"". The company said there was no evidence the failure was the result of a cyber attack. The IT failure affected check-in and operational systems, including customer service phone lines. BA said although some of its IT systems had returned, ""there will be some knock-on disruption to our schedules as aircraft and crews are out of position around the world. The GMB union had suggested the failure could have been avoided, had the airline not outsourced its IT work. BA denied the claim, saying: ""We would never compromise the integrity and security of our IT systems"".",Monday 29 May 2017,29-May-17,BA flights chaos continues at Heathrow,More than a third of departures are cancelled after an IT crash causes a second day of disruption.,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40074751
"Portland attack: $600,000 raised for 'heroes' killed defending Muslim teen More than $600,000 (£468,000) has been raised for the families of the three US men attacked while defending a Muslim teenager and her friend on a train. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Ricky John Best were killed and Micah David-Cole Fletcher was severely injured in Portland, Oregon on Friday. They all intervened after a man launched into a verbal tirade against the teens, one wearing a hijab. The suspect, Jeremy Joseph Christian, was later arrested. The 35-year-old is due to appear in court on Tuesday, charged with two counts of aggravated murder, attempted murder, intimidation and being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon.  The FBI said it was still unsure if Mr Christian - who allegedly said ""all Muslims should die"" during the attack - will face charges for hate crime.  Meanwhile, Mr Fletcher continues to recover after sustaining a knife wound to his neck that his mother said was ""a millimetre"" from his jugular vein. He posted a picture from his hospital bed, alongside a poem on Saturday evening. One of the lines said: ""I spat in the eye of hate and lived."" The three men have been hailed as ""heroes"" in their local community, not least by Destinee Mangum - the 16-year-old who was travelling with her friend, 17, when the attack took place. ""I just want to say thank you to the people who put their life on the line for me, because they didn't even know me and they lost their lives because of me and my friend and the way we look,"" she told local channel KPTV. Close to 1,000 people gathered for a vigil in memory of Mr Namkai-Meche, 23, a recent college graduate, and 53-year-old army veteran Mr Best, a father-of-four, on Saturday evening. There have also been numerous tributes online to the men. Tributes have been paid to the men by the city's mayor, as well as Oregon governor Kate Brown and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who described their deaths as ""heartbreaking"". ""No one should have to endure this racist abuse,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""No one should have to give their life to stop it."" US President Donald Trump has yet to mention the attack. A tweet by a reporter with the Oregonian newspaper, asking Mr Trump if he had any comment on the attack, has been 'liked' more than 4,000 times.  And veteran journalist Dan Rather wrote an open letter to Mr Trump, which has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, imploring the president to speak out about their deaths. Mr Rather said: ""Two Americans have died leaving family and friends behind. ""They are mourned by millions more who are also deeply worried about what might come next. I hope you can find it worthy of your time to take notice.""",Monday 29 May 2017,29-May-17,Huge sums raised for 'Portland heroes',Tributes have continued to pour in for the men who died defending a Muslim teenager on Friday.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40080679
"Paris mayor may ban black feminist Nyansapo festival The mayor of Paris has called for a black feminist festival in the city to be banned on the grounds that it excludes white people. At the Nyansapo Festival in July, billed as ""blackfeminist"", 80% of the venue will be reserved for black women. Black people of any gender will be allowed in another area, while a third area will be open to all. Anne Hidalgo tweeted that she reserved the right ""to prosecute the organisers for discrimination"". Some French anti-racism organisations have condemned the festival. SOS Racisme called it ""an abomination"" and said it ""wallows in ethnic separation"", while Licra, the International League against Racism and Antisemitism, said: ""Rosa Parks would be turning in her grave."" On Friday the regional head of the far-right National Front party had challenged Ms Hidalgo to explain the ""blatantly racist"" event. The organisers said in a statement (in French) that they had been ""the target of a campaign of disinformation and fake news orchestrated by the extreme right"" and they were ""saddened to see some anti-racist associations let themselves be manipulated"". They continued by mentioning that many had ""no problem"" with women-only feminist groups when race was not stipulated. The festival is scheduled to take place in a property owned by the city of Paris, but the restricted event is in a public area. Organisers said the mayor subsequently had no jurisdiction over the event.",Monday 29 May 2017,29-May-17,Paris mayor may ban black festival,The majority of the events at the Nyansapo Festival will be open only to black women.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40080125

"Cannes Film Festival: The Square wins Palme d'Or Art world satire The Square, directed by Ruben Ostlund, has won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The Swedish title was one of 19 films competing for the prestigious Palme d'Or, in the 70th year of the festival on the French Riviera. Prizes also went to British filmmaker Lynne Ramsay and director Sofia Coppola.  But juror Jessica Chastain said she was shocked at the way many of the films she saw at Cannes portrayed women.  Chastain, star of The Help said it was ""disturbing"" to see the way women were depicted on screen, saying: ""The one thing I really took away from this experience was how the world views women. There are some exceptions, but for the most part I was surprised with the representation of female characters on the screen in these films. ""I hope when we include more female story-tellers we will have more of the women that I recognise in my day-to-day life, ones that are proactive, have their own agency and don't just react to the men around them - they have their own point of view."" Toni Erdmann director Maren Ade, who also sat on the jury, agreed more female directors were needed, adding: ""We're missing a lot of stories they might tell."" Palme d'Or: The Square Grand Prix: BPM (Beats per Minute)  Jury prize: Andrey Zvyagintsev, Loveless 70th anniversary award: Nicole Kidman Best director: Sofia Coppola, The Beguiled Best actress: Diane Kruger, In the Fade  Best actor: Joaquin Phoenix, You Were Never Really Here Best screenplay: Joint winners Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou for The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and Lynne Ramsay for You Were Never Really Here  Camera d'Or (best debut film): Leonor Serraille, Jeune Femme Short film prize: A Gentle Night, Qiu Yang Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, who chaired the jury, said the winning film was a rich and ""completely contemporary"" tale about ""the dictatorship of being politically correct"".  The director of Julieta and All About My Mother said the festival was ""the birth of a lot of wonderful movies"" and that he had been ""completely mesmerised"" by some of the films in competition.  But he appeared emotional when discussing how much he had loved Grand Prix winner BPM, which tells the story of activist group Act Up and the lack of government support for Aids sufferers in the 1990s.  ""They are real heroes who saved many lives,"" he said, his voice breaking.    BPM had been a favourite to win the Palme d'Or, alongside bleak Russian family drama Loveless and heist thriller Good Time, with The Square an outsider.  Jury members also included Men in Black star Will Smith, South Korean director Park Chan-wook, Chinese star Fan Bingbing, Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, French actress and writer Agnes Jaoui and composer Gabriel Yared.  British filmmaker Lynne Ramsay was the joint winner of best screenplay for You Were Never Really Here, for which Joaquin Phoenix was named best actor. It tells the story of a private contractor sent to rescue a young girl from a paedophile ring, and Ramsay said it had been a ""labour of love"", and that ""to be recognised for the writing is great"".  The best director award went to Sofia Coppola for The Beguiled, a drama about an injured soldier taken in by a girls' boarding school during the American Civil War - only the second time the prize has gone to a woman.  It stars Nicole Kidman as the headmistress and the Australian actress was given a 70th anniversary award to mark the fact she had three films and one TV series shown at this year's festival.  The Square stars Claes Bang with British actor Dominic West and Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss in supporting roles. While it received good reviews, it was not tipped to win the main prize.  After winning, Ostlund said: ""I think my first reaction was 'oh my God, how fantastic'. I mean I hugged the main actor that I've been working with almost for two years now. We have been struggling together and it was a very, very happy ending of that work of course."" The Square focuses on Bang's character Christian as the gallery he runs prepares for a new exhibition in the gallery's courtyard in which members of the public can stand and ask for help. Meanwhile, his private life starts to unravel after he is mugged and seeks the return of his belongings in an unorthodox way.  It received four stars from the Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin, who said that while it is a ""slow burn"", it has a ""cumulative force that can't be resisted"", while Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian gave it the same score, calling it ""thrillingly weird"".  The Swedish director was previously best known for Force Majeure, about a family ski trip rocked by a father's selfish reaction to an avalanche.

"US Mississippi shooting leaves eight dead An overnight shooting in the US state of Mississippi has left eight people dead, including a local deputy sheriff, police say. The shootings took place in three separate locations in Lincoln County, south Mississippi. A male suspect, named in local media as Willie Cory Godbolt, was detained by police on Sunday morning. Authorities say it is too early to consider any possible motive behind the killings. Mr Godbolt's mother-in-law, two other relatives, and deputy sheriff William Durr were found dead at the scene of the first shooting in Bogue Chitto, reports said. The next shooting took place in Brookhaven, where ""the bodies of two juvenile males were located"", police said. The third crime scene was in East Lincoln, where a man and woman were killed. Willie Godbolt spoke to local paper The Clarion-Ledger after he was detained. He said he was ""sorry"" and ""ain't fit to live, not after what I done"". He said he was in conversation with his wife and her family ""about me taking my children home"" when someone called the police.  His stepfather-in-law, Vincent Mitchell, told AP news agency that Mr Godbolt's wife and two children had been staying with him after she left her husband. Mr Godbolt opened fire after the deputy sheriff arrived, Mr Mitchell added. A 16-year-old, believed to have been taken hostage by the suspect, was safe, The Daily Leader reported. Mississippi governor Phil Bryant called the incident a ""senseless tragedy"". ""Every day, the men and women who wear the badge make some measure of sacrifice to protect and serve their communities. Too often, we lose one of our finest,"" he said in a statement. Mr Durr, the deputy sheriff killed in the shootings, was described as a ""mild mannered officer"" who liked making people smile.

"South Africa: Jacob Zuma 'plans second home in Dubai' South Africa's embattled president Jacob Zuma has been planning to set up home in Dubai, according to emails published in South African media. The reports suggest deepening ties between President Zuma and the controversial Gupta business family. But the president's spokesman has dismissed them as an utter fabrication. Pressure on Mr Zuma has been mounting in recent months because of corruption scandals, cabinet sackings and his handling of the economy. Senior members of Mr Zuma's governing ANC tabled a motion of no confidence against him on Sunday at a closed-door meeting of the party's national executive committee.  But the chairman of the meeting blocked the move because it was not on the official agenda, state-owned  broadcaster SABC said.  It is the second time in six months that party rebels have mounted such a challenge and they are thought likely to try again.  The BBC's Karen Allen in Johannesburg says the ANC now looks like it's in permanent firefighting mode Emails between President Zuma's son Duduzane and figures from a company owned by the controversial Gupta family - who reportedly wield considerable influence over Mr Zuma - include a letter to the Abu Dhabi royal family, our correspondent says. ""I am happy to inform you that my family has decided to make the UAE a second home,"" the president is quoted as saying. ""It will be a great honour for me and my family to gain your patronage during our proposed residency in the UAE."" This opens up questions as to whether this is part of an exit strategy, with Mr Zuma's party appearing to be turning against him, our correspondent adds. Meanwhile Zuma loyalists will continue their efforts to block any no-confidence motion on technical grounds. A motion submitted by opposition parties is being pushed through parliament and is now being examined by the constitutional court. The president's successor is expected to be selected at a major conference of the ANC's top brass in December. Until then the party looks set to limp from crisis to crisis, our correspondent says. Mr Zuma's allies say he will remain in office until his term ends in 2019, but evidence of his unpopularity seems to be growing. He was forced to abandon a May Day rally this year after he was booed by workers demanding his resignation.

"Macron: Awkward Trump handshake a 'moment of truth' French President Emmanuel Macron has said his clenched handshake with Donald Trump was ""not innocent"" and was a ""moment of truth"". The awkward encounter saw each grip the other's hand so firmly that their knuckles turned white . Mr Macron told French media he had wanted to ""show he would not make small concessions, not even symbolic ones, but also not overdo things"". The leaders met in Brussels on Thursday ahead of a Nato summit. As their vigorous handshake continued over several seconds, Mr Macron and Mr Trump also looked each other fixedly in the eyes until the US president attempted to disengage.  Mr Macron told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper his approach to the encounter had been about getting respect. ""Donald Trump, the Turkish president or the Russian president see things in terms of power relationships, which doesn't bother me,"" he said. ""I don't believe in diplomacy through public criticism but in my bilateral dialogues I don't let anything pass. That is how you get respect.""

"Iraq Mosul offensive: Civilians 'in grave danger' - UN Civilians are being hit hardest as Iraq's military assault on Mosul enters its final phase, the country's UN humanitarian relief co-ordinator says. Lise Grande told the BBC residents were in grave danger as so-called Islamic State (IS) was directly targeting families. Many people in the city are already facing severe shortages of water and electricity. Iraqi forces say they have recaptured several villages from IS militants. Troops have been trying to drive IS fighters out of the last remaining strongholds they control in Mosul's Old City. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled the northern city since the offensive to reclaim it was launched in October last year. At the scene: Nafiseh Kohnavard, BBC Persian, Old City frontline Federal Police snipers covered us as we moved forward, heading to the frontline. Gunfire echoed around the streets. Every few minutes, a mortar exploded nearby. Soon the streets were too dangerous, so we moved from house to house through holes in the walls.  Major Ali of the sniper brigade told the BBC real time intelligence was crucial.  ""There are still many civilians there, most of them hiding in their basements and running out of food.""  From our position we could see the iconic Al-Nouri mosque - where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had addressed crowds after announcing the caliphate.  ""They won't give up on this mosque,"" Major Ali said. ""They will fight till they die and will use civilians in every way they can to slow us down."" Ms Grande said that the next part of the assault was going to be the hardest. ""Civilians are going to be at the most extreme risk they have been during the entire campaign,"" she said. ""We know that ISIL [IS] is directly targeting families as they try to escape, we know that there are very limited stocks of food and medicines, we know that there are severe shortages of water and electricity. ""All of the evidence points to the fact that the civilians who are trapped in these neighbourhoods and districts are in grave danger."" One recently rescued civilian, Homira, told the BBC's Nafiseh Kohnavard she had ""almost died of hunger"". ""We felt like we were in a prison. We had to stay for days in our basement. When we saw the Iraqi forces it was the happiest moment of our lives."" The government announced the recapture of eastern Mosul in January but the fight for complete control of the western half continues.   Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, are involved in the offensive.  Earlier this month, coalition officials estimated the number of militants in Mosul to be fewer than 1,000 - compared with 3,500 to 6,000 militants in and around the city before the offensive began last October. The UN has said the battle has left more than 8,000 civilians dead or wounded, but that figure only comprises people transferred to medical facilities. Iraq's military does not release casualty figures, but US Gen Joseph Votel told a Congressional hearing at the end of March that at least 774 Iraqi security personnel had been killed and 4,600 wounded. More than 580,000 civilians have also been displaced by the fighting, among them 419,000 from western Mosul, the Iraqi authorities say.

"Hay Festival 2017: Stephen Fry's warning for the web Stephen Fry has issued a stark warning to prepare for the internet of the future, or face the worst of science fiction's predictions.  The actor and comedian was giving a lecture at the Hay Festival in Powys, when he made the claims. Fry criticised the ""technophobes"", including politicians, who he said had been too slow to react to developments like artificial intelligence. The annual literary event began on Thursday with increased security. Fry was delivering one of the Festival's Reformations lectures - one of a series of special lectures inspired by the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's Protestant reformation. ""Whether it is winter that is coming, or a new spring, it is entirely in our hands so long as we prepare,"" he told the crowd in Hay-on-Wye. ""While it's hard to calculate the cascade upon cascade of new developments and their positive effects, we already know the dire consequences and frightening scenarios that threaten to engulf us,"" he said. Science fiction writers and dystopians have already laid out the ""nightmare"" consequences, he added. Fry went on to say a ""great transformation in human society"" was under way, greater than both the printing press and industrial revolutions. It was ""the greatest change to our way of living since we moved from hunting and gathering to settling down in farms, villages and sea ports and started to trade and form civilisations"", he added. ""Whether it will alter the behaviour, cognition and identity of the individual in the same way that it is certain to alter the behaviour, cognition and identity of the group, is a hard question to answer.  ""But believe me when I say that it is happening. To be frank, it has happened."" The ""war chests"" of technology entrepreneurs were helping to fund the rapid development of artificial intelligence and robotics, he said. Mr Fry revealed to the audience that he has an internet-connected fridge at his home in Los Angeles that allows him to check its contents via his mobile phone. He also said he owned an automated car that allowed him to read a book or watch television as the car drove itself along California's freeways. This year's 30th anniversary festival has 800 events and its line-up includes Graham Norton and US politician Bernie Sanders. Festival organisers have asked visitors to allow extra time for arrival at the festival site and not take large bags or rucksacks, as extra security measures are in force in the wake of the Manchester terror attack.",Monday 29 May 2017,29-May-17,Fry sounds warning over future of internet,"Delivering a lecture at the Hay Festival, the actor said society could face ""dire consequences"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40076701
"France's Macron holds 'frank exchange' with Putin French President Emmanuel Macron says he held a ""frank exchange"" with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in their first face-to-face talks. The pair discussed ""disagreements"" in the meeting, held at the sumptuous Versailles palace near Paris. But Mr Macron said he wanted to work with Russia over the conflict in Syria in the struggle against terrorism.  Meanwhile, Mr Putin said he wanted to strengthen economic ties with France after the restrictions of recent years. France is in the coalition backing Sunni Arab and Kurdish rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has strong military help from Russia and Iran. However, in the joint news conference after Monday's talks both leaders said there were opportunities for their countries to work together more closely. Mr Macron said he wanted France to ""strengthen"" its ""partnership with Russia"" in its fight against so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria. He said he favoured ""a democratic transition"" that would ""preserve the Syrian state"". But the use of chemical weapons would be a ""red line"" that would draw an ""immediate response"" from France, he added. Mr Putin agreed that uniting against terrorism would achieve ""positive results"" and said it was impossible to ""combat the terrorist threat by destroying statehood"". Despite the sweltering weather, this meeting held a touch of frost from the start, when the two leaders greeted each other with brief handshakes and small grim smiles. Two hours later, as they emerged from their meeting, the mood was - if anything - even cooler. There is lots of substance for them to disagree on, but there is a personal awkwardness to this new relationship, too. Mr Putin's apparent support for Mr Macron's far-right presidential rival during the campaign, and allegations by the Macron campaign that Russian agents had tried repeated cyber-hacks, have coloured the meeting. During the press conference, the French leader strongly defended banning two Russian media outlets from covering his presidential campaign, describing them as ""agents of propaganda"". France has taken a firm line against Moscow over Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Western sanctions, imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, have been ratcheted up since pro-Russian rebels carved out a breakaway region in eastern Ukraine. President Putin used the news conference to call for these sanctions to be lifted, saying they did not help create stability in the east.  But both leaders agreed to revive joint working groups, and to reconvene talks with Germany. Mr Putin appeared to support Mr Macron's nationalist rival Marine Le Pen during the 2017 presidential campaign. He hosted her in the Kremlin a month before the election's first round. But Mr Putin told Monday's news conference: ""This doesn't mean that we somehow tried to influence the election at all... that would have been impossible as well."" He also said there was ""nothing to discuss"" when asked by journalists about allegations Russia has tried to meddle in foreign elections. Before becoming president this month, Mr Macron accused Russia of pursuing ""a hybrid strategy combining military intimidation and an information war"". On Monday he accused pro-Kremlin news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik of being ""organs of influence and propaganda"" against his campaign. President Macron said they discussed the alleged persecution of gay men in the Russian republic of Chechnya, and President Putin had promised ""measures aimed at establishing the whole truth about the activities of local authorities"". He said France would remain ""vigilant"" on the issue. Versailles was chosen for the Macron-Putin meeting because an exhibition dedicated to Tsar Peter the Great is opening there. The tsar's visit to Paris and other parts of Europe 300 years ago greatly influenced his reign.  Ties between Russia and France became increasingly strained under Mr Macron's predecessor François Hollande. Monday's meeting was President Macron's latest diplomatic test after the G7 talks in Sicily and the Nato summit in Brussels where he turned the tables on US President Donald Trump by holding him in a clenched handshake until their knuckles went white. Afterwards, Mr Macron told French media the exchange was ""not innocent"" and he had wanted to ""show he would not make small concessions, not even symbolic ones, but also not overdo things"".",Tuesday 30 May 2017,30-May-17,Macron holds 'frank exchange' with Putin,"Despite disagreements, the new French president says his country could work with Russia more.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40082346
"Cyclone Mora: Bangladesh tries to evacuate one million Bangladeshi authorities are trying to evacuate up to a million people before a powerful cyclone makes landfall. Cyclone Mora is likely to hit the eastern coast early on Tuesday, the meteorological department said. Port cities in the south-east have been asked to display the highest warning system known as ""great danger level 10"". Ports further west are on level 8.  The cyclone formed after heavy rains in Sri Lanka caused floods and landslides that killed at least 180 people. The worst flooding in 14 years on the island has affected the lives of more than half a million people. More than 100 people remain missing. In Bangladesh, people in Chittagong district have been flocking to nearly 500 cyclone shelters as warnings were announced on loudspeakers. Schools and government offices are being used to shelter people, and residents of hilly areas are also being urged to evacuate. Bangladesh profile Flood-hit Sri Lankans fear more rain Low-lying areas of Cox's Bazar, Chittagong and many other coastal districts are ""likely to be inundated"" by a storm surge of 1.2m-1.5m (4-5 feet) above normal levels, the meteorological department warned.  ""We are targeting zero casualties and we will try our best to evacuate more than a million before the landfall,"" disaster management authority spokesman Abul Hashim told the AFP news agency.  He said nearly 300,000 people had already been moved to cyclone shelters. Though Bangladesh is used to cyclones, many people don't live in dwellings sturdy enough to withstand bad weather, the BBC's South Asia editor Charles Haviland says. Their lives, and the crops on which so many of them depend, are constantly at risk when cyclones hit. Fishing boat and trawlers have been advised to remain in port, and coastal ferries have suspended operations Bangladesh is yet to fully recover from flash floods in the north-east of the country in April that destroyed rice crops and pushed rice prices to record highs.

"Moscow storm: 16 killed in Russian capital and region Sixteen people were killed when a severe thunderstorm hit Moscow and the region around the Russian capital on Monday, officials say. Hundreds of trees were toppled, and about 150 people needed medical help. It was the deadliest storm in the city for more than 100 years, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. The winds of up to 110 km/h (70 mph) were described by meteorologists as extremely rare for the city, and caused structural damage to buildings. Electrical cables were reportedly damaged as Moscow was lashed with high winds, hail and torrential rain. The city's investigative committee said that ""hurricane winds"" had blown down trees across the city, killing five pedestrians. An elderly man was also killed at a bus stop, it said.  Two people were killed after a tree fell onto their summer house, Interfax reported. On Tuesday, the authorities raised the death toll to 16, saying that 11 people were killed in the capital and five in the Moscow region. BBC Weather: Forecast for Moscow Delays had been reported on some metro lines but normal service later resumed.   Tourist Frank Davis, from Newfoundland in Canada, was caught in heavy traffic in Moscow as the ""dramatic storm"" struck. ""The sky darkened noticeably and the winds were extremely strong.... with debris flying around from all directions,"" he told the BBC. Moscow's Mayor, Sergei Sobyanin tweeted: ""My condolences to the friends and family of those killed."" Teams were busy trying to clear fallen trees from the city's streets. ""We reacted quickly and are recovering now,"" said Gulnara Shakirova, a community service assistant. ""Many good trees, not old ones, were brought down. We are trying to remove all the trees before night falls."" Photos circulating on social media show fallen trees blocking roads and a large roadside advertising board crushing parked cars.

"General election 2017: Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May face TV grilling Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn faced questions on Brexit and foreign policy from a live studio audience in a special general election programme. Mr Corbyn was quizzed about his views on drone strikes, tax-raising plans and past campaigning in Northern Ireland. Mrs May defended her social care reforms and was repeatedly asked if she had changed her mind on Brexit. But the leaders did not appear together, as Mrs May declined to take part in a head-to-head encounter.  The Labour leader chose to be first up in the Battle for Number 10 show, which was broadcast by Sky News and Channel 4, after winning a coin toss. In a Q&A with the studio audience, a small business owner attacked Mr Corbyn's ""ruthless short-sighted policies"" such as increasing corporation tax and putting VAT on private school fees. ""This country is badly divided between the richest and the poorest,"" the Labour leader replied, asking the man whether he was ""happy"" that children were going to school hungry and being taught in ""supersized"" classes. Mr Corbyn was also pressed on his previous campaigning in Northern Ireland, with an audience member accusing him of attending a commemoration for members of the IRA, an Irish paramilitary group. The Labour leader said he had been seeking a ""dialogue"" in the 1970s and 1980s and that he had marked a minute's silence ""for everyone who died in Northern Ireland"". A lot of people are only just starting to think about the election and they won't have sat through every bit of the TV event last night. What they'll glean, though, from snippets and headlines is a sense of how this campaign has changed, written on the leaders' faces. Jeremy Corbyn, more comfortable, more assured, with better prepared answers. Theresa May, really having to explain herself. And in this last stage the vulnerabilities are exactly where you'd expect. For Mr Corbyn it's on issues like security, his personal views on groups like the IRA. And for Mrs May, it's a Conservative prime minister facing tough questions over public services. He would not be drawn on whether he would order a drone strike against a terrorist plotting overseas to attack the UK. ""I would want to know the circumstances,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""You can't answer a hypothetical question without the evidence."" He was also asked back-to-back questions on Brexit - one from a Leave voter calling for immigration controls and another from an unhappy Remain supporter. He refused to set a target for migration numbers, saying Labour would act to prevent the undercutting of wages. He then told the Remain supporter Labour had to ""accept the reality of the referendum"". Mr Corbyn, a committed republican, was asked by Jeremy Paxman why abolishing the Monarchy was not in Labour's manifesto. ""It's not in there because we are not going to do it,"" he replied, adding that he had ""a very nice chat with the Queen"". He said he described the death of Osama Bin Laden as a ""tragedy"" because he wanted him to be arrested and put on trial. And he also defended using the term ""friends"" towards the militant Islamist group Hamas, calling it ""inclusive language"" at a meeting where he had been promoting the need for a two-state solution in the Middle East. Mrs May was asked about the Tories' planned reforms to the way social care is funded, with a man in the audience describing the changes as a ""dementia tax"". The PM confirmed an overall cap would be put on costs, which had not been included in the Tories' election manifesto, but did not say where this would be set. She promised she would listen to charities and voters on where the cap should be, adding that the social care system would ""collapse"" without reform. Replying to an audience member, she said spending on the NHS was increasing because she wanted a ""first class"" health service. But she said it was only possible if there was a ""really strong economy to pay for it"". ""That's where the Brexit negotiations, but so much else, actually comes in,"" she said. Mrs May defended her view that richer pensioners should not receive the winter fuel payment, saying she had met pensioners who agreed with her. She was repeatedly asked by Mr Paxman whether she had changed her mind on Brexit - having campaigned for a Remain vote before the referendum. He said: ""What one's bound to say is that if I was sitting in Brussels and I was looking at you as the person I had to negotiate with, I'd think: 'She's a blowhard who collapses at the first sign of gunfire'."" But Mrs May said: ""I take the view that we can make a success of Brexit."" The referendum had ""drawn a line"" under the Remain versus Leave debate, she said, adding that her decision to trigger the election was because of rival parties ""trying to frustrate the process"". On immigration, the former home secretary defended the repeated failure to hit the government's target of reducing net migration to below 100,000. She said there was ""no single measure"" to change immigration figures, describing it as a ""constant work"". Lib Dem Tim Farron said both leaders had committed a series of ""blunders"". He claimed Mr Corbyn had made an unfunded commitment to lift the welfare cap, and Mrs May would not say how many people would be hit by a ""dementia tax"". The SNP's Patrick Grady said: ""I think we've found out why the prime minister has been so reluctant to take part in leaders' debates tonight."" Plaid Cymru criticised the lack of mentions of Wales, and the Green Party said Mrs May had ""avoided the question"" on her ""unfair"" social care reforms.

"Manchester attacks: Police issue new bomber photo A new image showing bomber Salman Abedi on the day he attacked Manchester Arena has been released by police.  Officers are appealing for people who might have seen him carrying the blue suitcase between 18 and 22 May. The BBC has also obtained CCTV footage which appears to show Abedi in a shop the day before the bombing in which 22 people died. Police are searching a landfill site on the outskirts of Bury, Greater Manchester. The 22-year-old visited the Wilmslow Road area of Manchester and the city centre with the suitcase, police said. Det Ch Supt Russ Jackson, from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: ""I want to stress that this is a different item than the one he used in the attack. ""We have no reason to believe the case and its contents contain anything dangerous, but would ask people to be cautious."" He added: ""The public should not approach the case if they see it but contact police immediately on 999."" New CCTV footage has also emerged which appears to show Abedi shopping at a convenience store. The footage was recorded in a store close to the flat where the suicide bomber was just hours before the attack. The BBC has passed the footage to investigating officers. Greater Manchester Police have asked anyone with information to contact the Anti-Terrorist Hotline in confidence on 0800 789 321. Officers have been searching a landfill site in Pilsworth near Bury.  Footage of the search shows investigators in white boiler suits and blue helmets raking through the debris near a large red tent. Earlier, there were searches in Whalley Range, Manchester and in Chester and Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, where a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences. Officers are also currently searching an address in the Rusholme area of Manchester. In all, 14 men are now being questioned in connection with the investigation into the attack. Meanwhile, Manchester City Council has announced there will be a vigil in St Ann's Square on Monday just after 22:30 BST - exactly one week after the attack took place. Manchester Victoria station will also reopen on Tuesday, British Transport Police have said.  The station, which is connected to Manchester Arena where the bomb went off, suffered structural damage in the incident. NHS England said 52 people injured in the attack were still being treated in hospital - including 19 in critical care. Abedi detonated a bomb on 22 May at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande.   MI5 said it would hold an inquiry into the way it dealt with warnings from the public that he was a potential threat.   The security service, which was alerted to his extremist views three times prior to last Monday's attack, will examine how it dealt with the warnings. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was right for MI5 to review its processes. MI5 has launched a ""post incident investigation"" into how the Manchester bomber was overlooked, while a separate report is being prepared for ministers and those who oversee the work of the service.  A Whitehall official said previously that Abedi was one of a ""pool"" of former subjects of interest whose risk remained ""subject to review"" by the security service and its partners. BBC Newsnight reported that at 16, Abedi - born in Manchester to Libyan parents - fought against the Colonel Gaddafi regime with his father during the school holidays. It was while at Manchester College that two people who knew Abedi have confirmed they made separate calls to an anti-terrorism hotline to warn the police about his extremist views. Anyone with information is asked to call the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789321.

"German leaders step up attacks on Trump Germany's top politicians have stepped up criticism of US President Donald Trump, a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel said the US and UK were no longer reliable partners. On Monday Mrs Merkel said it was right not to gloss over differences with the US, while her foreign minister said Mr Trump's actions ""weakened the West"". It comes days after the G7 summit, where Mr Trump refused to commit to the 2015 Paris climate deal. Germany goes to the polls in September. German opposition leader Martin Schulz accused Mr Trump of having tried to ""humiliate"" Mrs Merkel in Brussels. It was unclear exactly what incident a furious Mr Schulz was referring to, but he accused the US president of ""acting like an autocratic leader"". Speaking at a conference on sustainable development in Berlin, Mrs Merkel reiterated her call for Europeans to take their fate into their own hands. The debate at the G7 meeting in Italy had shown it would be difficult to make the 2015 Paris climate deal work, she said. Those putting on ""national blinkers"" on matters of international sustainability were going about things the wrong way, she said. Mr Trump has said he will make a decision on the Paris agreement this week. He has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal and expressed doubts about climate change. However, Mrs Merkel also said at the conference that she remained a ""convinced Trans-Atlanticist"". On Sunday she said Germany and Europe wanted friendly relations with the US and UK as well as with other regional powers, such as Russia. Germans loathe Donald Trump - they dislike his rhetoric and his politics. And politicians of every hue are disgusted by his refusal to co-operate with the rest of the G7 on climate change and migration.  Angela Merkel's uncharacteristically candid tone has gone down well with the electorate and, given the general election is four months away, perhaps the public support of her main rival Martin Schulz should not come as a surprise. ""It's Merkel versus Trump"", exclaimed one headline.  But it is unlikely that Mrs Merkel expects - as some commentators would have it - to re-set the transatlantic relationship. Behind the scenes in Berlin, there is a grudging acceptance that, like him or not, Germany has to do business with Mr Trump.  The US is a vital trade partner and, as Germany's interior minister admitted on Monday afternoon, co-operation on security and defence is of immense importance and will be intensified.  Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel meanwhile accused the US of ""short-sighted policies"" that he said were against EU interests. ""Anyone who accelerates climate change by weakening environmental protection, who sells more weapons in conflict zones and who does not want to politically resolve religious conflicts is putting peace in Europe at risk,"" Mr Gabriel said. Mrs Merkel is on the campaign trail ahead of elections in September.

"Tiger Woods held on drink-driving charge in Florida Golf star Tiger Woods was arrested on a drink-driving charge in Florida early on Monday morning, police say. Police recorded the arrest at 07:18 local time (11:18 GMT). The golfer was released a few hours later, records from Palm Beach County police show. He was arrested in the town of Jupiter at around 03:00 local time, media reports say. He has not made any comment. The police record lists the charge as Driving Under the Influence (DUI). It specifies an unlawful blood alcohol level and says that he was released ""on his own recognisance"", meaning he promised in writing to co-operate with future legal proceedings. The 41-year-old golfer has been recovering from recent back surgery and last blogged about his health on 24 May. He wrote that the surgery had relieved terrible pain and that he hadn't ""felt this good in years"". He said the outlook for a return to competitive golf was ""positive"" but that he was not in a ""hurry"". ""I want to play professional golf again but I'm not looking ahead,"" he said. ""I can't twist for another two and a half to three months. Right now, my sole focus is rehab and doing what the doctors tell me. I am concentrating on short-term goals."" America's 14-time major champion came back after 15 months out injured in December, but has not played since his back problems recurred in February. Plans to compete at Augusta in April - on the 20th anniversary of his first Masters win - had to be abandoned. Tiger Woods has not won a tournament anywhere since 2013, while his title drought in major championships dates back to 2008.  The mugshot shows a dishevelled Tiger Woods, bleary-eyed and unshaven -  just the sort of image he would not want associated with himself in public. The picture will haunt him throughout these proceedings and beyond. This is someone who has put back together his public life after that epic fall from grace with all the news of the extramarital affairs that broke in 2009. What we gather from someone who has a jealously guarded lifestyle in terms of his privacy is he spends most of his time playing computer games. We know he speaks glowingly about being a father and looking after his children.  He's divorced and shares custody of his children and that's pretty much all we know of Tiger Woods' lifestyle at the moment, other than he says he wants to return to professional golf once this recovery has been completed. Does golf need him as much as it once did? Perhaps not. A whole generation of golfers, with Rory McIlroy at the vanguard, have now come through. But Woods remains a huge box-office draw. Golf has suffered in his absence in recent years but it is getting used to the fact that he's unlikely to come back right at the very top of the game.  Read more: Can Woods repair damage of new low? His personal life came under intense scrutiny in 2009 after he was charged with careless driving outside his Florida home. He later admitted to having had extra-marital affairs and made a frank public apology. He said he had received professional help and planned to undergo further therapy. The golfer lost several sponsors over the scandal and took a break from competitive golf.

"BA boss 'won't resign' over flight chaos BA chief executive Alex Cruz says he will not resign and that flight disruption had nothing to do with cutting costs. He told the BBC a power surge, had ""only lasted a few minutes"", but the back-up system had not worked properly. He said the IT failure was not due to technical staff being outsourced from the UK to India. Mr Cruz said ""I am profusely sorry"" to the 75,000 passengers affected across 170 airports in 70 countries. He said two thirds of passengers will have reached their destination by the end of the day. There was no evidence of a cyber attack, he added.  ""There was a power surge and there was a back-up system, which did not work at that particular point in time.

A leaked staff email revealed Mr Cruz had told staff not to comment on the system failure. When asked about the email he told the BBC the tone was clear: ""Stop moaning and come and help us"". But Mick Rix from the GMB union did not accept Mr Cruz's explanation. He told BBC Radio 4: ""Why didn't the back-up kick in? Basically because there's been an absolute brain drain out of the company."" The airline is now close to full operational capacity after the problems resulted in mass flight cancellations at Heathrow and Gatwick over the bank holiday weekend. On Monday, BA said they plan to fly more than 95% of their normal flight schedule. Questions remain about how a power problem could have had such impact, said the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones.

Heathrow advised affected BA passengers not to travel to the airport unless their flights had been rebooked, or were scheduled to take off on Monday.  Passengers on cancelled flights have been told to use the BA website to rebook.  Until now, Mr Cruz had only posted videos on Twitter apologising for what he called a ""horrible time for passengers"".  BA is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel expenses, and travel industry commentators have suggested the cost to the company - part of Europe's largest airline group IAG - could run into tens of millions of pounds.

"British Columbia: Greens to back minority NDP government British Columbia Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver says his party will support a ""stable minority"" government led by the New Democratic Party (NDP).  The deal means the end of of 16 years in power for the Liberal Party in the Canadian province. The Liberals won 43 seats to the NDP's 41 in a recent election but failed to retain their absolute majority. This means British Columbia will have its first minority government since the 1950s. Both Mr Weaver and NDP Leader John Horgan announced the deal on Monday afternoon. ""This is an opportunity for people coming from an opposition to bring new eyes to government,"" Mr Horgan said. ""I think we have a case now that this parliament and this legislature can work,"" Mr Weaver added. The Green Party says it will support the NDP for four years. Mr Weaver was careful to stress it would not be a coalition government and the Green Party would not have any seats in cabinet.  The BC Liberals failed to clinch a majority when they lost a crucial district to the NDP on 24 May, two weeks after the 9 May election, after all absentee ballots were tallied. It left them with 43 out of 87 seats in the provincial legislature. The left-leaning NDP won 41 seats and the Green Party won three. Almost 60% of people voted against the Liberal Party in the May election.  After many years in power, the BC Liberal Party has struggled recently amid high-profile donation scandals and a strong environmental movement in the province that vehemently opposes the oil and gas industry. The provincial Liberals are a separate party from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's federal Liberals.

"WannaCry ransom notice analysis suggests Chinese link New analysis suggests Chinese-speaking criminals may have been behind the WannaCry ransomware that affected thousands of organisations worldwide. Researchers from Flashpoint looked at the language used in the ransom notice. They said the use of proper grammar and punctuation in only the Chinese versions indicated the writer was ""native or at least fluent"" in Chinese. The translated versions of the ransom notice appeared to be mostly ""machine translated"". The WannaCry ransom note could be displayed in 28 different languages, but only the Chinese and English versions appeared to have been written by humans. The English text also used some unusual phrases such as: ""But you have not so enough time"". The WannaCry cyber-attack infected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries, affecting government, healthcare and private company systems. The UK's National Crime Agency, the FBI and Europol are investigating who was responsible for the ransomware. Some earlier analysis of the software had suggested criminals in North Korea may have been behind it. But the Flashpoint researchers noted the Korean-language ransom note was a poorly translated version of the English text. ""It was only really the Chinese and the English versions that appeared to be written by someone that understood the language,"" said cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey. ""The rest appeared to come from Google Translate. Even the Korean."" Prof Woodward noted that the people behind the ransomware had not attempted to retrieve the money victims had paid in Bitcoin, and added it was likely they were keeping a low profile. ""I actually think they've run for the hills,"" he told the BBC. ""Their so-called command and control system, the thing that controls quite a lot of the software, has all been turned off.

"Texas legislators scuffle after Republican calls immigration agents US legislators scuffled in the Texas capital during chaotic scenes after a protest against an immigration crackdown halted proceedings. Republican Matt Rinaldi accused a Hispanic Democrat of ""threatening his life"" and said another Democrat had assaulted him. It happened after he told a group of Democrats he had called Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The protest targeted a bill to make local police enforce immigration laws. The bill is aimed at so-called ""sanctuary cities"", where many undocumented migrants live and officials including police are not allowed to ask about an individual's immigration status in the course of their duties. President Trump has pledged to end the practice. Protesters opposing the so-called SB4 bill began cheering and chanting from the public gallery of the capital building in Austin, bringing proceedings to a halt on the final day of the legislative session before they were removed by state troopers. Mr Rinaldi then called ICE before reportedly walking over to a group of Hispanic legislators and telling them what he had done. ""This is BS. That's why I called ICE,"" ABC news agency quoted him as saying. He later told the Texas Tribune that the protesters, some of whom he said had T-shirts saying ""We are illegal and here to stay"" were ""disrupting and breaking the law"". Mr Rinaldi and several Democrats have traded lurid accusations about what happened next. The Republican released a statement in which he accused Representative Poncho Nevarez of saying he would ""get me on the way to my car"" and said Ramon Romero had assaulted him while other Democrats had had to be held back by colleagues. Mr Rinaldi said he had told Mr Nevarez that he would ""shoot him in self-defence"" and said he was currently under police protection. Democrats meanwhile said Mr Rinaldi had shouted expletives at them and said his call to ICE showed how the new law could be abused. ""Matt Rinaldi looked into the gallery and saw Hispanic people and automatically assumed they were undocumented. He racial profiled every single person that was in the gallery today. He created the scenario that so many of us fear,"" the Texas Tribune quoted Mr Romero as saying. Mr Nevarez branded Mr Rinaldi a ""liar and a hateful man"". Mr Trump has called for a federal funding cut for those municipalities that refuse to hand over their undocumented residents and said he will focus on deporting criminals first.",Tuesday 30 May 2017,30-May-17,Scuffles in Texas over immigration bill,A Republican says Democrats threatened his life after he called immigration officers on protesters.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40086633
"Trudeau asks Pope Francis to apologise for schools Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asked Pope Francis to apologise for the role of the Catholic Church in a Canadian school system where indigenous children were abused for decades.  The PM met the pontiff at the Vatican on Monday as part of his trip to Italy for the G7 summit.  The residential schools were set up from the 1880s to take children from their families and assimilate them into mainstream Canadian society.  The last one closed in 1996. ""I told him how important it is for Canadians to move forward on real reconciliation with the indigenous peoples and I highlighted how he could help by issuing an apology,"" Mr Trudeau told reporters after meeting the pope. He said he had invited the pontiff to make the apology in Canada. Some 150,000 aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families, and sent to live in church-run boarding schools where they were forbidden to speak their language or practise their own culture. Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called for a papal apology, as part of the healing process for survivors.  Although the Vatican has not commented on Mr Trudeau's request, it confirmed the talk was ""cordial"" and lasted about 36 minutes. It said the conversation ""focused on the themes of integration and reconciliation, as well as religious freedom and current ethical issues"" but did not mention an apology directly. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has been tasked with collecting the stories of survivors and recommending a way forward for the country to heal, has called the residential school system ""cultural genocide"".  In its report, the commission recommended the Catholic Church issue a formal apology for its part in the residential school system.  Similar apologies have been issued by Anglican, Presbyterian and United Churches, who along with the Catholic Church helped run these schools as joint ventures with the Canadian government.   In 2008, former prime minister Stephen Harper issued an apology on behalf of Canadians, calling it ""a sad chapter in our history"".  A year later, Pope Benedict expressed ""his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church"" to a delegation from the Assembly of First Nations, a national advocacy organization, who went to the Vatican.  In 2015, Mr Harper met Pope Francis and called attention to the commission's findings. Mr Trudeau said he also spoke with the Pope about a subject dear to both of them: the importance of stopping climate change.  ""We talked about how important it is to highlight the scientific basis of protecting our planet and the moral and ethical obligations to lead, to build a better future for all people on this earth,"" Mr Trudeau said. During the visit to the Vatican, Mr Trudeau was joined by his wife Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau. While in Italy, he also visited the Roma football club and will meet Italy's prime minister and president.

"Russia inquiry expands to Trump lawyer Michael Cohen President Donald Trump's lawyer has received requests for information from two congressional panels investigating alleged Russian political meddling. Michael Cohen confirmed to US media that he had been asked to ""provide information and testimony"" about any contacts he had with the Kremlin.  Mr Cohen said he turned down the request because it was ""overly broad"" and ""not capable of being answered"". Last week Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was named in the Russia probe. Mr Cohen is the latest Trump associate to rebuff the House and Senate investigations into the matter.  White House communications chief quits ""I declined the invitation to participate, as the request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,"" he told ABC News.  He later told CNN that lawmakers ""have yet to produce one single piece of credible evidence that would corroborate the Russia narrative"".  The widening inquiry into Russia's alleged interference in the US election and whether Trump campaign officials colluded with the Kremlin is threatening to engulf his fledgling presidency. His son-in-law is said to be under scrutiny as part of the FBI inquiry. According to US media, Mr Kushner, a top White House aide, discussed setting up a back channel line of communication with Moscow's envoy to Washington during a December meeting. In Tuesday's daily briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer refused to be drawn on whether Mr Kushner had tried to set up such a secretive mode of contact.

"Ariana Grande to play Manchester benefit concert on Sunday Justin Bieber, Coldplay and Katy Perry are among the stars who will join Ariana Grande at a benefit concert following the Manchester attack. The One Love Manchester show will raise money for those affected by the blast which left 22 dead. Take That, Miley Cyrus and Pharrell will also play at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground gig on Sunday.  Grande is offering free tickets to fans who were at her Manchester Arena show on 22 May. Others performing include One Direction's Niall Horan and Usher, with more to be announced. The venue has a 50,000 capacity and the gig will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC radio.  Tickets for the tribute concert go on sale on Thursday, with prices yet to be announced. Those attending are asked not to bring bags. Proceeds will go to the We Love Manchester emergency fund, which has been set up by Manchester City Council, in conjunction with the British Red Cross.  Organisers expect at least £2m to be raised from the event.  Grande sent a tweet with details of the gig, with the One Love logo featuring the bunny ears she is known for wearing. Her manager Scooter Braun also tweeted, with the message: ""We stand with you."" Seven children were among the victims who died when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb on 22 May. Grande, 23, suspended her Dangerous Woman tour, including cancelling two shows at London's O2 Arena, following the attack.  But the US singer had promised to return to Manchester, saying: ""I don't want to go the rest of the year without being able to see and hold and uplift my fans"". ""I'll be returning to the incredibly brave city of Manchester to spend time with my fans and to have a benefit concert in honour and raise money for the victims and their families."" Earlier on Tuesday, Greater Manchester Police chief constable Ian Hopkins told BBC Radio Manchester: ""When the idea of the concert came up, my first reaction was, we need to speak to the families of the victims and see what they feel. ""It's fair to say that the majority of them are very much in favour, there are some that clearly aren't and that is absolutely understandable."" After the attack, the singer posted her condolences on Twitter, saying: ""Broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words."" Fifty people injured in the attack were still being treated in hospital - including 17 in critical care. Manchester Victoria station reopened on Tuesday. The station, which is connected to Manchester Arena, suffered structural damage in the incident.    As well as BBC radio, the three-hour show - which will take place from 19:15 BST - will be broadcast on Capital Radio networks. BBC director general Tony Hall said: ""Bringing the nation together, the BBC is proud to be broadcasting what will undoubtedly be a moving tribute to the victims and their loved ones."" The kick-off for Manchester United player Michael Carrick's charity testimonial, taking place in Manchester on the same day as the tribute concert, has now been moved to an earlier time so it does not clash with the concert.  Police say their investigation into the attack is ""making good progress"" and has around 1,000 people working on it. In total 16 people have been arrested - but a woman and a 16-year-old boy were later released without charge. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"French Open bans Hamou over attempts to kiss reporter on live TV Tennis player Maxime Hamou has been banned by the organisers of the French Open after he tried to kiss a female reporter repeatedly during a live TV interview. The French player, 21, kissed journalist Maly Thomas while holding her around her neck and shoulders, despite her efforts to duck away. The French Tennis Federation (FTT) condemned the ""reprehensible behaviour"" and ordered an investigation. Hamou has apologised for his actions. The incident happened after he was knocked out of the first round of the competition on Monday.  It is the latest case to provoke allegations of harassment of female sports reporters.  Several anchors and commentators on the Eurosport programme Avantage Leconte laughed and clapped as it unfolded. The episode drew ire on social media, including from French politician Cécile Duflot. ""He kisses her by force, she tries to get away, he holds her by the neck and everyone... laughs #tired,"" the Green MP wrote on Twitter (in French). Quoted by the Huffington Post France, Ms Thomas described the player's actions as ""frankly unpleasant"". ""If I hadn't been live on air, I would have punched him."" In a statement on Facebook on Tuesday, Hamou said: ""I offer my deep apologies to Maly Thomas if she feels hurt or shocked by my attitude during her interview. ""I have just spent a magnificent week here at Roland Garros... and I expressed my overflow of enthusiasm crudely towards Maly, who I know and respect sincerely. ""I'm still learning every day from my mistakes to become a better tennis player and a better person.""  Eurosport welcomed his apology and offered its own to ""any viewers who may have been affected"" by its broadcast.

But, contrary to the hysteria about ""Iron Angie"" signalling a slamming of European doors on Trump USA and Brexit UK, what I mean by her ""taking back control"" is this: Like the UK's Leave campaigners, Angela Merkel is heading towards a vote. Though Germany isn't debating EU membership, it's in the run-up to an autumn general election. Mrs Merkel is now on the campaign trail and not at all above injecting some populism into her politics.  President Trump is hugely unpopular among German voters and his failure to commit to the Paris climate accord, at the G7, and to Nato's Article Five last week angered many Europeans. Mrs Merkel's pointed comments about no longer being able to rely fully on allies were delivered to rapturous applause while on the campaign trail in the (conservatively) pumped arena of a Munich beer hall. Campaign Trail Merkel, as we'll call her for the moment, is also aware that German voters aren't just partial to a bit of Trump-thumping - but also to a full-on promotion of Europe.  Liberal Europeans have felt immensely frustrated at the constant Brussels bashing by nationalist politicians over the past couple of years. Resentment has built up, too, over Russia seemingly being able to do whatever it wants in Crimea, Syria and the cyber-sphere despite supposed international norms. And there's real anger and fear about Donald Trump the Unpredictable, a man many in Europe judge to be ignorant about world politics, diplomacy and the workings of a democracy.  Germans believe more than ever now that Europe needs be assertive; to stick together and be strong together.  They are feeling more confident, too, with pro-EU, pro-Merkel Emmanuel Macron as French president.  Enter Chancellor Merkel's emotive language à la ""take back control', except what she says is ""Europe needs to take its fate into its own hands"". The Bavarian beer hall loved it, as do many Germans, giving Mrs Merkel that edge over her political rivals. However. Angela Merkel - political old hand and consummate pragmatist - has not been subsumed by Campaign Trail Merkel.   Would she like to be able to safeguard the stability and safety of Europe without relying on what she regards as an unpredictable US and an unreliable UK? Absolutely. She believes Europe must co-operate more on defence: pooling resources, spending military budgets more intelligently and bolstering itself as much as it can. But she knows full well that Europe can't go it alone. Certainly not Germany, with its post World War Two sensitivities about taking up arms. Britain leaving the EU means the bloc only has one military power left  - the French one - and one seat on the UN Security Council. Nato is now more important than ever for EU safety. Europe relies, too, on British intelligence and co-operation in fighting terrorism. Chancellor Merkel has been around the political block more than a few times, and she is not now biting the hand that feeds (bear in mind, too, America's huge importance for German business). Donald Trump may not be so sure about Nato, but the US vice-president and the defence secretary say they are fully committed. And at Nato, the G7 and when she visited Donald Trump in Washington in March, Angela Merkel was diplomatic at all times, leaving snubs and small shows of strength to France's keen-to-prove himself presidential newbie, Emmanuel Macron. When Angela Merkel says Europe needs to be take its fate in its own hands, she means keeping transatlantic links open and strong, but being politically, emotionally and - if possible - militarily prepared if it all falls apart. Rather than closing the door on the US, she hopes very much the US isn't turning its back on Europe.",Wednesday 31 May 2017,31-May-17,How Merkel is 'taking back control',Germany's leader was unusually outspoken on the threat she thinks Trump and Brexit pose.

"Three Mile Island to close 40 years after nuclear accident A Pennsylvania power plant which triggered the worst nuclear disaster in US history is to close, its owner says. Three Mile Island - which experienced a partial reactor meltdown in 1979, spawning nationwide protests - will shut in 2019. Exelon Corp, which owns the facility, said the low cost of natural gas extraction had made nuclear-generated electricity unprofitable. Since 2013, six nuclear reactors in the US have shut for economic reasons. Fragile future for US nuclear power Nuclear plants have closed before their licences expired in California, Florida, Nebraska, Vermont and Wisconsin, with more set to be decommissioned in the next several years. The low cost of electricity is being attributed to natural gas extraction from shale formations such as in Pennsylvania's Marcellus region. The Three Mile Island meltdown occurred on 28 March, 1979, alarming more than two million people who lived nearby and the city of New York 180 miles (300km) away. A federal inquiry found no deaths or injuries were caused by the accident, though it dented public confidence in nuclear energy for years. In 1994 a protester drove through the gates of Three Mile Island, causing the company to spend more than $1m (£777,000) on security upgrades. Further upgrades were ordered after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Three Mile Island employs 675 people, supplies power to 800,000 homes, and pays more than $1m in state income taxes, according to the company. No one died, there were no direct health impacts, but the Three Mile Island nuclear accident burned so deeply into the US psyche that it has helped limit the future use of the power source across America. While citizens were frightened by TMI, so too were investors. The accident happened after just three months of commercial operation causing the plant owner to go bankrupt. The whole clean up effort took 14 years and cost almost $1bn. In the wake of TMI, demand for nukes fell through the floor. The Watts Bar plant in Tennessee, the first new nuclear installation in the US, became operational in 2016, two decades after the previous one. Many US scientists, greatly concerned by the threat of climate change, have come out in support of nuclear. They argue that the need for large-scale low-carbon energy outweighs concerns over safety.

"Does Wonder Woman live up to the hype? It's nearly here! The much anticipated live action superhero movie, Wonder Woman, is out in the UK on Thursday. The film stars Gal Gadot in the title role and Chris Pine alongside as US spy Steve Trevor.  So what do the critics make of it? Had it really broken the mould and come in below the two-hour mark, Wonder Woman could have been a thoroughly transporting film. As it stands, it's intermittently spot-on, particularly in the pops of humour and romance between the exotically kick-ass yet approachable Gadot and the supremely charismatic Chris Pine as an American working for British intelligence, the first man the Amazon princess has ever met. With eager fans unlikely to bemoan the film's length or its lapses in narrative energy, Wonder Woman will conquer their hearts as it makes its way around the globe.  Read the full review. Wonder Woman is the first major studio superhero film directed by a woman, and it shows in a number of subtle, yet important ways. As skimpy as Gadot's outfits may get, for example, Jenkins' camera never leers or lingers gratuitously - Diana is always framed as an agent of power, rather than its object. When she finally unleashes her full fighting potential in an extended battle sequence on the front lines, the movie comes alive in a genuinely exhilarating whirl of slow-motion mayhem, and Diana's personality is never lost amid all the choreography. Read the full review. Those hoping a shot of oestrogen would generate a new kind of comic-book movie - and revive DC's faltering movie universe - might need to lower their expectations. Like many people out there, I had no shortage of excitement and goodwill towards this female-led superhero project, but in the event it's plagued by the same problems that dragged down previous visits to the DC movie world: over-earnestness, bludgeoning special effects, and a messy, often wildly implausible plot. What promised to be a glass-ceiling-smashing blockbuster actually looks more like a future camp classic. Read the full review. Hit or not - and you'd better believe its box-office results will be scrutinised under a microscope - Wonder Woman is close to a knockout on its own ambitious terms. Patty Jenkins' film officially belongs to the DC Extended Universe, the same sunless and woebegone realm that brought us Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. In a genre where fanboy entitlement regularly calls the tune, Wonder Woman's feminism - in its eagerly daubed poster-paint strokes - feels like a rarity. Time will tell whether Hollywood is about to find itself in the thrall of a heroine addiction. But as the credits rolled, I was already craving another hit. Read the full review. It's Gadot's film and she is electric as Wonder Woman, a role she debuted in last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to wide acclaim. Unshackled from that film's dreary baggage, the Israeli actress is able to shine as brightly in Wonder Woman's smaller moments as she does when she lifts a tank with her bare hands. Her expressive face is magnetic as she witnesses the horrors of the world for the first time. Her optimism is at times heartbreaking - we, unlike Diana, know how evil the world truly is - but it is also inspiring. Read the full review. Although Jenkins doesn't avoid the traditional effects-swamped finale, she manages to work emotional impact into the climax. Most importantly, she delivers a heroine who lives up to the majesty of her moniker and stands apart from her superhero brethren, not just in her gender but in her well-communicated ideals. Wonder Woman reminds us that, at their finest and most enduring, such films inspire us to be all that we can be. Read the full review.

"Mike Dubke, White House communications director, quits The White House communications director has resigned only three months after being hired by President Donald Trump. Mike Dubke, an experienced Republican strategist, was hired in March to revamp the White House media strategy. As part of the shake-up, White House press secretary Sean Spicer will reportedly hold on to his position, but there will be fewer media briefings. The reshuffle follows reports of disarray in the White House communications team. Russia inquiry expands to Trump lawyer Mr Dubke tendered his resignation on 18 May and is leaving on good terms, according to Axios News, a politics website which first reported his exit.  White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said Mr Dubke had agreed to stay on until Mr Trump returned from his trip to the Middle East and Europe on Saturday. ""Mike tendered his resignation just before the President's historic international trip and offered to remain onboard until a transition is concluded,"" said Mr Priebus.   ""Mike will assist with the transition and be a strong advocate for the President and the President's policies moving forward.""  According to news website Politico, Mr Dubke, 47, provided few details on his departure in an email to friends. ""The reasons for my departure are personal,"" he wrote, ""but it has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration. ""It has also been my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments.  ""This White House is filled with some of the finest and hardest working men and women in the American Government."" Mike Dubke was an outsider hired to bring focus and discipline to the Trump White House communications operation. After just three months on the job, he's back on the outside again. In the vast scheme of things, whether Dubke willingly quit or was forced to resign isn't all that important. Despite his title, it's difficult to gauge how much influence he ever had with the president. What's worth noting is that the first change in what could be a larger White House shake-up has come in the communications department, with rumours of further reorganisation imminent.  This lends credence to earlier reports that the president views his administration's ongoing difficulties as a messaging problem, and not one of policies or management. If that's the case, it appears the new message will be delivered with bare knuckles.  Old campaign hands, like the pugnacious Corey Lewandowski, are being considered for White House jobs and the president could be hitting the road for more unscripted big-venue rallies with his supporters.  It would mark a return to the campaign tactics that won Mr Trump the presidency - where every stumble or controversy was countered aggressively, political decorum and tradition be damned. President Trump is reported to have been frustrated with White House messaging amid congressional and FBI investigations into whether his campaign officials colluded with an alleged Kremlin plot to help him win the presidency. He recently raised the idea of scrapping the daily news briefing altogether and holding one himself every fortnight. According to Axios, Mr Trump plans to follow through on that plan by taking more questions directly from the media. Press Secretary Sean Spicer - who made a return to the media podium on Tuesday - will reportedly hold fewer on-camera briefings.  ""I think the president is very pleased with his team and he has a robust agenda,"" Mr Spicer told reporters during a 20-minute press conference. ""Ultimately the best messenger is the president himself,"" he added.  ""He's always proven that,"" said Mr Spicer, ""that he is the best messenger not just for what he wants to articulate but that the American people resoundingly chose him as their president - because he understands the frustrations and concerns and values of the American people and he is probably the best person to communicate that"". White House rallies to Kushner's defence How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Mr Dubke, who previously worked as senior partner for Republican political advertising company Crossroads Media, was not part of the Trump campaign and was not seen as a loyalist. The White House has not named a successor for Mr Dubke. However, Corey Lewandowski, former campaign manager for Mr Trump, was spotted leaving the White House on Monday. Mr Lewandowski was forced out in June last year amid reports of a power struggle with Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and a senior White House adviser. However, Mr Kushner is now reportedly under scrutiny as part of the FBI's investigation into alleged Moscow influence that is engulfing Mr Trump's fledgling presidency. According to reports, the combative Mr Lewandowski could rejoin the administration soon to lead a White House ""war room"" to counter the narrative that Mr Trump is too close to Russia. The fight-back strategy could include hiring more lawyers to handle the allegations, according to reports.

"Olivia Newton-John reveals she has breast cancer again Singer and actress Olivia Newton-John has revealed she has breast cancer again, 25 years after recovering from her original diagnosis. The Grease star has postponed upcoming tour dates after discovering that severe back pain she has been suffering is a result of the disease spreading to her spine. The 68-year-old was due to perform across the US and Canada next month. She will have treatment and expects to return to the stage later in 2017.  Last week, the four-time Grammy award winner cancelled planned meet-and-greet events for the upcoming tour dates due to ""severe back pain"". A statement on Tuesday said: ""The back pain that initially caused her to postpone the first half of her concert tour, has turned out to be breast cancer that has metastasized to the sacrum.  ""In addition to natural wellness therapies, Olivia will complete a short course of photon radiation therapy and is confident she will be back later in the year, better than ever, to celebrate her shows."" After surviving her initial cancer diagnosis in 1992, Newton-John became a prominent campaigner for others facing the disease, as well as on other health issues.  She set up the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness research centre in Melbourne, Australia. It was partially funded by a sponsored walk along the Great Wall of China, aided by celebrity friends including Sir Cliff Richard and Joan Rivers. Tuesday's statement advised ticket holders for her upcoming concerts to contact the venue about refunds.

"Canada's largest province to raise minimum wage to C$15 Canada's largest province is raising the minimum wage to C$15 ($11.14, £8.66) an hour. Ontario Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne made the announcement on Tuesday, as part of an overhaul of the province's labour laws. The minimum wage would be raised in two steps, from C$11.40 to C$14 on 1 January 2018, and then to C$15 a year later. Alberta also plants to raise its wage to C$15 in October 2018. That would give Ontario the highest wage in the country for most of 2018.  Wynne billed the raise as ""the largest increase in our province's history.""  ""People are anxious about their jobs, and they're anxious about the future,"" she said during a press conference on Tuesday. ""In a time of change like this, when the very nature of work is being transformed, we need to make certain that our workers are treated fairly.""

Ms Wynne's government has been sliding in the polls and faces an election challenge in June 2018. In recent months, she has introduced a minimum income pilot project, free medication for people under 30 and expanded rent controls, both moves popular with large portions of the population. But not everyone is in favour of the changes. The Ontario Chamber of Commerce said it is concerned about the impact the wage hike will have on businesses and the economy.

"Canada 150: Giant duck's cost prompts Ontario row A giant rubber duck is coming to Canada, but not everyone thinks the idea is so spec-quackular. The 15m (49ft 3in) high ducky was designed by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman and has travelled the world, from Brazil to Taiwan. The duck will float in Toronto's waterfront as part of a festival celebrating Canada's 150th birthday.  But the bill for the duck has some politicians squawking. The 13.6-ton toy will make its grand debut at Redpath Waterfront Festival on 1 July, before travelling across the province as part of the Ontario 150 tour. But whimsy doesn't come cheap, and the Ontario government has chipped in C$121,000 ($90,000; £70,000) towards the Redpath Waterfront Festival, the government confirmed.  It is unclear how much the duck itself cost, or what portion of government funding is going towards the duck.  Ontario's Progressive Conservative leaders slammed the duck as a waste of taxpayers' dollars during question period on Monday, opining that government funding for the inflatable sculpture was ""an absolute cluster duck"" and ""quack economics"".

"Amazon shares hit $1,000 for first time Shares in online retail giant Amazon have risen above the $1,000 mark for the first time. The shares touched $1,001.2 at one point on Tuesday before slipping back to $996.7. It originally listed its shares in May 1997 for just $18 each. Amazon now has a market capitalisation of about $478bn, which is more than twice that of Wal-Mart. After starting as a bookseller, it has steadily expanded to become much broader-based retailer. According to consultancy Slice Intelligence, Amazon now accounts for about 43% of all online sales in the US. Amazon is now the fourth-largest US company by market capitalisation, behind Apple, Google owner Alphabet, and Microsoft. Alphabet's class A shares were also close to hitting four figures on Tuesday, trading at $996, meaning the company is worth around $681bn. Despite the rise in Amazon's share price, the Nasdaq index - of which Amazon is a member - closed down 7 points or 0.11% at 6,203.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 50.81 points to 21,029.47 while the wider S&P 500 index slid 2.91 points to 2,412.91 as investors picked their way through a raft of US economic data. Figures from the Commerce Department showed that consumer spending posted its biggest rise for four months in April, climbing 0.4%. That followed an upwardly revised 0.3% increase in March. Separate data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by 0.2% in April, following a 0.2% fall in March. Prices in April were up 1.7% from a year earlier, although that was down from March's figure of 1.9%. The so-called core PCE price index - which strips out food and energy prices, and is the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation measure - showed a 1.5% annual rise, compared with a 1.6% increase in March.

"Portland stabbing: Jeremy Joseph Christian appears in court A suspect accused of fatally stabbing two people on a train in Oregon, after they intervened in his alleged anti-Muslim rant, has appeared in court. Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, is charged with murder, attempted murder, possession of a weapon and intimidation. During his brief appearance, he shouted slogans such as: ""You call it terrorism. I call it patriotism."" He could also be heard shouting ""Death to the enemies of America"". ""Leave this country if you hate our freedom - death to antifa,"" he said, using a common abbreviation for the anti-fascist movement. He did not enter a plea to the charges and is due to appear in court again on 7 June. President Donald Trump has tweeted that last week's attack was ""unacceptable"". Portland's mayor is meanwhile trying to ban a forthcoming right-wing rally in the West Coast city. The attack unfolded on Friday afternoon after the suspect began spewing ""hate speech"" towards two young women on a train, police said. Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Ricky Best, 53, intervened and were fatally stabbed at the Hollywood Transit Center train station, said investigators. Another man, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, was slashed in the neck and is recovering. He was in court on Tuesday to see Jeremy Joseph Christian's appearance.  Destinee Mangum, 16, said she had been with a friend wearing a hijab on the first night of Ramadan - Islam's holiest month - when the suspect targeted them. ""He told us to go back to Saudi Arabia, and he told us we shouldn't be here, to get out of his country,"" she told KPTV-TV. ""He was just telling us that we basically weren't anything and that we should kill ourselves."" The mother of Namkai-Meche, Asha Deliverance, took to Facebook to write an open letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to ""take action"". ""Your words and actions are meaningful, here in America and throughout the world,"" she wrote. ""Please encourage all Americans to protect and watch out for one another. Please condemn any acts of violence, which result directly from hate speech & hate groups.  ""I am praying you will use your leadership to do so."" Detectives say they are investigating Mr Christian's background of extremist ideology. At a ""Free Speech"" rally in Portland on 29 April, police confiscated a baseball bat he had allegedly been using to threaten liberal protesters. Mr Christian was later filmed performing a Nazi salute, and shouting racial epithets while wearing an American flag as a cape.  On his Facebook page he has praised Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and posted a death threat against Hillary Clinton. And he wrote: ""If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS"". Mr Christian has also voiced support for Senator Bernie Sanders, the Wall Street-bashing, 2016 Democratic presidential candidate.  According to the Oregonian newspaper, Mr Christian pleaded guilty in 2002 to robbing and kidnapping the owner of a store.  In 2010 he was charged with theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm.  Mayor Ted Wheeler said he welcomed the president's tweet on Monday condemning the attack. But he urged the federal government to revoke a permit for a ""Trump Free Speech Rally"" scheduled for this weekend in Portland. He said the organisers are ""coming to peddle a message of hatred"" and that hate speech is not protected by the US constitution.  A Facebook page for the event says there will be speakers and live music in ""one of the most liberal areas on the West Coast"", and thanks Mr Trump ""for all you have done"". Mayor Wheeler also asked the federal government to deny a permit for a ""March Against Shariah"" planned in Portland for 10 June. ""Our City is in mourning, our community's anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation"", said the city leader. The American Civil Liberties Union defended the rallies, saying in a series of tweets that ""the government cannot revoke or deny a permit based on the viewpoint of the demonstrators. Period"".

"Tamir Rice shooting: Cleveland police officer Loehmann sacked A white police officer who fatally shot a 12-year-old black boy in Cleveland, Ohio, in November 2014 has been sacked for lying on his cadet application. Timothy Loehmann opened fire on Tamir Rice as he played with a pellet gun, sparking widespread protests.  City officials announced Mr Loehmann's sacking and a 10-day suspension for his partner at the scene, Frank Garmback.  The penalties come more than a year after a grand jury declined to indict them in the boy's death. An investigation found the officers had not violated procedures but also uncovered details which led to Mr Loehmann's dismissal. He had been allowed to resign from another police department instead of being sacked for being emotionally unstable. But he did not disclose the full circumstances when applying to join the Cleveland police force. ""Patrol Officer Loehmann had been charged with rule violations concerning his application... specifically answers he had provided on his personal history statement,"" Cleveland's Director of Public Safety, Michael McGrath, said at a press conference.  The other officer, Frank Garmback, was assigned extra tactical training in addition to his suspension.  Tamir Rice had been playing with the pellet gun in a park on 22 November, when a police cruiser pulled up close by. Rookie patrolman Loehmann jumped out and fired his service weapon twice. Tamir Rice died the next day.  The shooting was one of several involving police and unarmed black males, which led to mass protests across the US. 17 July, 2014: Eric Garner is restrained by police in New York and held down despite telling police he could not breathe. The hold caused his death - but no charges are brought against the officer 9 August, 2014: Teenager Michael Brown is shot at least seven times in Ferguson, Missouri. His death and the controversy surrounding it spark mass protests around the US 22 November, 2014: Tamir Rice is shot and killed in Cleveland. 4 April, 2015: Walter Scott is shot in the back five times by a white police officer, who is fired and later admits violating Mr Scott's civil rights. in a plea deal. 12 April 2015: Freddie Gray is arrested in Baltimore, immobilised, but not safely secured with a seat belt. He suffers spinal injuries while in police custody, and is denied medical assistance he requested. He dies a week later. Mr Loehmann was still in his six-month probationary period when the shooting happened. His dismissal is effective immediately, officers said.  In April 2016, the city agreed to pay $6m (£4.14m) to the family of Tamir Rice. The settlement carried no admissions of any wrongdoing. Samaria Rice, Tamir's mother, told WKYC television she was ""relieved"" that the officer had been sacked but did not agree with the reasons. ""They fired him for lying on his application, which I wish they would've fired him for killing Tamir,"" she said.  ""We still need accountability… he should have never been an officer in the first place."" ""This has been tough on our entire community,"" Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams said. He said the police department had changed its training and policies as a result, and that the use of deadly force had fallen.",Wednesday 31 May 2017,31-May-17,US officer in Tamir Rice shooting sacked,Timothy Loehmann was not sacked for shooting the child but for lying on his job application form.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40098657
"Paris climate deal: EU and China rebuff Trump Chinese and EU leaders are to agree a joint statement on the Paris climate agreement saying it is ""an imperative more important than ever"". A draft of the document, seen by the BBC, stresses the ""highest political commitment"" to implement the deal. It will be widely seen as a rebuff to the US, as President Trump prepares to announce on Thursday if the US is withdrawing from the accord.  The joint statement will be published on Friday after a summit in Brussels.  For more than a year, Chinese and EU officials have been working behind the scenes to agree a joint statement on climate change and clean energy. The document highlights the dangers posed by rising temperatures, ""as a national security issue and multiplying factor of social and political fragility,"" while pointing out that the transition to clean energy creates jobs and economic growth.  ""The EU and China consider the Paris agreement as an historic achievement further accelerating the irreversible global low greenhouse gas emission and climate resilient development,"" the draft document says.  ""The Paris Agreement is proof that with shared political will and mutual trust, multilateralism can succeed in building fair and effective solutions to the most critical global problems of our time. The EU and China underline their highest political commitment to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement in all its aspects."" Both sides say they will step up action to and ""forge ahead with further policies and measures"" to implement their national plans on cutting carbon. Significantly, both the EU and China agree that they will outline their long term low carbon strategies by 2020. The document outlines other areas of co-operation including on the development and linking of carbon markets. There will also be bilateral work on energy labelling, energy performance standards and the performance standards of buildings.  ""The EU and China are joining forces to forge ahead on the implementation of the Paris agreement and accelerate the global transition to clean energy,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete. ""No one should be left behind, but the EU and China have decided to move forward."" Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.       The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.   Countries agreed to: To date, 147 out of the 197 countries have ratified the accord, including the US, where the accord entered into force last November. Exxon shareholders back 'historic' vote on climate Antarctic ice crack takes major turn  The increased co-operation between the EU and China comes as reports indicate a further cooling in the US towards the Paris accord.  Several sources, quoted by US media, suggest that President Trump is set to pull out. The president himself tweeted he would make his announcement at 15:00 (19:00 GMT) on Thursday.  This comes after the President failed to find common ground with other global leaders at G7 summit in Taormina, Sicily. In the wake of that meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel vented her frustration with the US position. ""The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very dissatisfying,"" she told reporters. ""There are no indications whether the United States will stay in the Paris Agreement or not."" The new move by the EU and China was warmly welcomed by environmental campaigners, rattled by the prospect of the world's second largest emitter of carbon pulling out of the globally supported agreement. ""If US-China climate cooperation gave birth to the Paris Agreement, now it is up to EU and China to defend and enhance it,"" said Li Shuo, from Greenpeace.

"'Covfefe': Trump spokesman plays down odd tweet White House press officer Sean Spicer has sought to defend an apparently garbled tweet by President Donald Trump which baffled and amused the internet. In a tweet posted just after midnight Mr Trump wrote ""despite the constant negative press covfefe"". The tweet stayed up all night, trending worldwide to much merriment. Asked by a reporter if people should be concerned, Mr Spicer said, ""No, the president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant."" Mr Trump, who presumably had meant to write ""press coverage"" and failed to finish his sentence, later deleted it and, acknowledging the jokes, wrote, ""Who can figure out the true meaning of ""covfefe"" ???  Enjoy!""   That follow-up appeared at 06:09 (10:00 GMT) on Wednesday, more than six hours after the original message (posted at 00:06).  ""Do you think that people should be concerned that the president posted something of an incoherent tweet last night and that it then stayed up for hours?"" a reporter asked Mr Spicer. ""Er, no,"" he replied. ""Why did it stay up so long? Is nobody watching this?"" he was asked. ""No,"" Mr Spicer said before giving his cryptic explanation.  Others at the briefing simply asked, ""What does 'covfefe' mean?"" and ""What is 'covfefe'?""  without getting an answer. Mr Trump has continued tweeting from his personal account since becoming president in January, arguing that it helps him speak directly to Americans. Aside from the frequently controversial content, the account is known for its spelling mistakes such as ""unpresidented"" for ""unprecedented"", and ""honered"" for ""honored"", as this Business Insider article recalls.     But few Trumpisms have spread like ""covfefe""... Beyond Twitter, rail operator Eurostar got in on the joke, suggesting passengers might enjoy a ""covfefe"" (and even a coffee too).

"Kathy Griffin: CNN drops comic after 'sick' Trump stunt US broadcaster CNN has ditched a comedienne from its New Year programme after she posed with a fake decapitated head of President Donald Trump. ""CNN has terminated our agreement with Kathy Griffin to appear on our New Year's Eve program"" it said in a tweet. Griffin apologised after it provoked outrage - her New Year's Eve co-host Anderson Cooper said he was appalled. Mr Trump had said it was ""sick"" and his wife Melania called the photo ""disturbing"". ""Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself,"" said the president. ""My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this."" In a video message posted on Twitter, Griffin ""begged"" for forgiveness and said she had ""crossed a line"". The 56-year-old Emmy award-winner said she was asking celebrity photographer Tyler Shields to delete the photo from the internet. The gruesome image brought a storm of online criticism, including from Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Mr Trump's 2016 election rival Hillary. ""It is never funny to joke about killing a president,"" she tweeted. First Lady Melania Trump said it made her ""wonder about the mental health of a person who did it,"" she said in a statement, according to NBC News. Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney also chimed in, tweeting: ""Our politics have become too base, too low, & too vulgar, but Kathy Griffin's post descends into an even more repugnant & vile territory."" Mr Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, tweeted: ""Disgusting but not surprising. This is the left today. They consider this acceptable."" Griffin, who has been a staunch critic of President Trump, posted the image in a tweet on Tuesday. She added the comment: ""I caption this: 'There was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his … wherever.'"" As it became clear not everyone found it funny, she tweeted again: ""OBVIOUSLY, I do not condone ANY violence by my fans or others to anyone, ever! I'm merely mocking the Mocker in Chief."" In her video apology, she said: ""I'm just now seeing the reaction of these images. I'm a comic, I crossed the line. I moved the line and then I crossed it. I went way too far. ""The image is too disturbing. I understand how it affects people. It wasn't funny, I get it. I beg for your forgiveness."" One company has already cut ties with Griffin. The Utah-based makers of Squatty Potty toilet stools said they were cancelling an ad campaign featuring the comic because of the ""deeply inappropriate"" image.  Chief executive Bobby Edwards said in a statement: ""We have acted swiftly and decisively to demonstrate our commitment to a culture of decency, civility, and tolerance."" Unicorn Gold bathroom products also suspended an ad campaign starring Griffin. However, others pointed out that Mr Trump had hosted a controversial musician who called for former President Barack Obama to be killed. Ted Nugent had said President Obama should be ""tried for treason and hung"", called him a ""subhuman mongrel"" and invited him to ""suck on my machine-gun"".

"Being black in US tough says LeBron James after racist graffiti NBA superstar LeBron James has talked about the ordeal of suffering racism after the ""N-word"" was spray painted on to his Los Angeles home. ""No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are... being black in America is tough,"" he said. The graffiti was reported to police on Wednesday morning and the Cleveland Cavaliers star responded hours later. LAPD officials confirmed to the BBC the highly offensive nature of the racial epithet. Officers are reviewing surveillance footage to try to identify the vandal. James was speaking from San Francisco, where his team is training ahead of Game 1 of the NBA finals. ""Racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America, and hate in America - especially for African-Americans - is living every day,"" he said. He added: ""We've got a long way to go for us as a society and us as African-Americans until we feel equal in America."" VIDEO: Is it ever OK to use the N-word? The vandalism was discovered on James' private gate at about 06:45 local time, said Officer Lillian Preciado. James purchased the 9,440 sq ft home in 2015 for $21m (£16m) the LA Times reports. The 32-year-old is ranked as the highest-paid player in the NBA, reportedly earning more than $30m per year.

"Antarctic ice crack takes major turn There has been an important development in the big crack cutting across the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica.  The fissure, which threatens to spawn one of the biggest bergs ever seen, has dramatically changed direction.  ""The rift has propagated a further 16km, with a significant apparent right turn towards the end, moving the tip 13km from the ice edge,"" said Swansea University's Prof Adrian Luckman.  The calving of the berg could now be very close, he told BBC News.  However, he also quickly added that nothing was certain.  The fissure currently extends for about 200km in length, tracing the outline of a putative berg that covers some 5,000 sq km - an area about a quarter of the size of Wales.  The crack put on its latest spurt between 25 May and 31 May. These dates were the two most recent passes of the European Union's Sentinel-1 satellites. Their radar vision is keeping up a constant watch as the White Continent moves into the darkness of deep winter.  After some initial activity at the beginning of the year, the Larsen crack became stationary as it entered what is termed a ""suture"" zone - a region of soft, flexible ice. But this situation held only until the beginning of May, when the rift tip then suddenly forked. And it is the new branch that has now extended and turned towards the ocean.  When the berg's calving does finally take place, the block will probably drift away quite gradually from the ice shelf.  ""It's unlikely to be fast because the Weddell Sea is full of sea-ice, but it'll certainly be faster than the last few months of gradual parting. It will depend on the currents and winds,"" explained Prof Luckman.  Taking out such a large chunk of ice would mean the Larsen C shelf would lose more than 10% of its area. Previous research by the Swansea group has shown that this will put the shelf in a much less stable configuration.  Similar calving events on the more northerly Larsen A and Larsen B ice shelves eventually led to their total break-up. Scientists are concerned that this same fate could now await Larsen C.  Were the shelf to collapse (and even if it did, it would still take many years to complete), it would continue a trend across the Antarctic Peninsula.  In recent decades, a dozen major ice shelves have disintegrated, significantly retreated or lost substantial volume - including Prince Gustav Channel, Larsen Inlet, Larsen A, Larsen B, Wordie, Muller, Jones Channel, and Wilkins.  Prof Luckman's MIDAS Project is posting updates on the Larsen crack on its blog, and on its Twitter feed.

"Malaysia Airlines plane turns back after cockpit entry bid A Malaysia Airlines plane has been forced to turn back to Melbourne airport after a passenger tried to enter the cockpit. Flight MH128, bound for Kuala Lumpur, returned ""due to a disruptive passenger"", an airline statement said.  The flight landed safely and the passenger was arrested, police said, adding it was not terror-related. Police said he threatened passengers with a device but authorities ""quickly ascertained"" it was not an explosive. Malaysia's Deputy Transport Minister Abdul Aziz bin Kaprawi described it as a ""powerbank"", or mobile charger, according to the AFP agency. The suspect was a 25-year-old Sri Lankan man who was released from a psychiatric facility earlier on Wednesday, said Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton. The man had been living in Melbourne on a student visa, Mr Asthon said, clarifying earlier information he was an Australian citizen. Police initially treated it as a possible terrorism incident before determining it was ""a case involving a mental health issue"", the commissioner said. One eyewitness, Andrew Leoncelli, told Melbourne's 3AW radio station that 10 minutes into the flight he could ""hear this idiot saying that he wanted to go in to see the pilot"".  The man refused to sit down, and threatened to ""blow the plane up"", said Mr Leoncelli, a former professional Australian Rules football player.  ""The staff screamed out 'I need some help, I need some help'. So I jumped up, undid my buckle, and approached him,"" he said. Mr Leoncelli said the man ran down the plane towards the back, but was grabbed and disarmed of a black object ""the size of a watermelon"" which had two antennae and what appeared to be a smartphone input. The man was restrained, but the object remained on the plane for over an hour until passengers were allowed to leave, he added. Malaysia Airlines said the Airbus A330 was in the air for just 30 minutes of its eight-hour flight time before landing.  Heavily armed police boarded the plane just before midnight local time (14:00 GMT) and placed the man under arrest.  ""We are obviously concerned for the passengers and crew,"" said Victoria Police Superintendent Tony Langdon. ""It would have been a very traumatic experience for them."" Mr Ashton defended what local media said was a 90-minute delay in getting the 337 passengers and crew off the plane. He said authorities had waited until they felt confident there were no explosive devices on board. ""Decisions had to be made about what was the safest way to get passengers off the plane,"" he said. Both the airline and Australian authorities will investigate, Malaysia Airlines said. A number of flights were diverted following the incident, but the airport confirmed it was operating as normal.

"Kabul bomb: Afghan leader condemns 'cowardly' attack President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan has condemned a massive bomb attack in the capital Kabul, which killed at least 90 people, as ""cowardly"". A suicide attacker detonated a bomb hidden inside a tanker truck close to the heavily protected diplomatic area during the morning rush hour.  Some 400 people were injured by the blast, which left a deep crater. No group has said it carried out the attack but Taliban militants denied being involved. Recent bomb attacks in Kabul have been claimed either by the Taliban or so-called Islamic State (IS). Most of the casualties were Afghans but foreign nationals were also injured, including 11 US citizens. The bomb exploded close to the German embassy, where a number of staff were injured. Authorities in Germany postponed a deportation flight due to return failed Afghan asylum seekers, with a government source telling AFP news agency that diplomatic and consular staff had ""more important things to do than to deal with organisational matters"" so soon after the attack. The bomb went off at about 08:20 local time (03:50 GMT) near Zanbaq Square, outside the Green Zone. Reports vary as to the kind of vehicle used to deliver the bomb - either a water or sewage tanker.  One Western diplomatic source told AFP news agency the blast had been caused by more than 1,500kg (3,307lb) of explosives. The area is home to key buildings including embassies and the presidential palace. More than 50 other vehicles were destroyed. Many of the casualties appear to have been Afghan civilians on their way to work or school, and office workers in nearby buildings.  ""I have never seen such a terrible explosion in my life,"" local shop owner Sayed Rahman told Reuters news agency after his store was badly damaged.  Another resident, Abdul Wahid, told the BBC the blast had been ""like a heavy earthquake"". Those injured or killed in the attack included: Several countries including France and Turkey also reported damage to their embassy buildings. The BBC has been reacting to the death of its Kabul driver:  Read Waheed's tribute in full. It appears not. AFP's source at the interior ministry said there would be no flights for a few days - but they would resume.  Germany argues Afghanistan is a safe country for failed asylum seekers to return to - unlike Syria, for example.  Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned Wednesday's bombing, saying ""terrorism has no borders"". US President Donald Trump has ""condemned the attack, which occurred during the holy month of Ramadan, underscoring the barbaric nature of the terrorists who are enemies of all civilised peoples"", the White House said. Others including India, Pakistan and Pope Francis have also condemned the attack, with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressing ""abhorrence"" at the bombing. The Taliban has denied responsibility, but Afghan government spokesman Sadiq Sadiqi said it was ""very typical"" of them to do so in situations with many civilian casualties. ""Their denial will make no sense because it's very clear for people who is behind these kinds of attacks,"" he said. The Taliban said it would focus on foreign forces when announcing the start of their major spring offensive last month, and recently attacked an Afghan army training compound in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif. The IS claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack this month on a Nato convoy passing the US embassy in Kabul. At least eight civilians were killed. It has made no comment so far on the latest attack. The US has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, with another 5,000 from Nato allies. The Pentagon has reportedly pressed President Donald Trump to send thousands more troops back to the country to try to counter gains by the Taliban.

"Champs Elysees attack: Posthumous marriage for slain policeman The French policeman who was killed by a jihadist on Paris' Champs Elysees in April has been married in a posthumous ceremony with his gay partner. The wedding of late Xavier Jugelé and Etienne Cardiles was conducted in the presence of former President Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. France is one of the few countries where posthumous marriages are permitted by law. Mr Jugelé was shot dead on 20 April while on duty on the famous avenue. Two other officers were wounded in the attack - just days before the first round of the French presidential elections. The attacker, who was later named as convicted criminal Karim Cheurfi, was shot dead by security forces.  A note defending so-called Islamic State was found near his body. Xavier Jugelé, 37, was an active campaigner for gay rights. He was in a civil partnership and did not have children. His murder caused huge emotion across France, especially after the moving address by his partner at the subsequent ceremony of remembrance. ""I have no hatred, Xavier, because it is not like you and does not fit with what made your heart beat nor what made you a guardian of the peace,"" Mr Cardiles said. Originally from the Loire Valley region in central France, Mr Jugelé had been serving in the capital since 2014.  He was deployed on the night of the November 2015 attacks in Paris to the Bataclan concert hall, returning the following year on the night the venue reopened. Interviewed by the BBC's Nick Garnett at the same venue a year later, Mr Jugelé said: ""I want to celebrate life and say 'no' to terrorism.""

"BBC debate: Rivals attack Theresa May over absence Theresa May's political rivals lined up to criticise her for not taking part in a seven-way general election debate. She was accused of lacking ""guts"" and of ""running away from the debate"" during the 90 minute BBC TV event. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who represented the Conservatives, said ""part of being a good leader is having a good, strong team"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did not directly attack Mrs May's absence as he clashed with Ms Rudd over cuts. The prime minister ruled out appearing on televised debates soon after calling the election. She said on Wednesday that she preferred ""taking questions and meeting people"" on the campaign trail rather than ""squabbling"" with other politicians.  At one point, Mr Corbyn asked ""where is Theresa May, what happened to her?"" as he defended his own leadership abilities. But he engaged in a series of clashes with Ms Rudd over the squeeze on living standards and cuts to welfare as the debate heated up. Mr Corbyn told her: ""Have you been to a food bank? Have you seen people sleeping around our stations?  ""Have you seen the levels of poverty that exist because of your government's conscious decisions on benefits?"" The Labour leader also highlighted his plans to end the public sector pay cap and introduce a £10 an hour living wage by 2020. He said Labour would ""ensure our manufacturing industry and jobs are protected"", and he was ""absolutely sure"" his spending plans added up. Ms Rudd said the ""squabbling"" on display during the debate showed ""the coalition of chaos in action"". She said Mrs May had the strength to ""take us through Brexit"" and a vote for anyone else is a vote for Mr Corbyn ""and that coalition"". Lib Dem leader Tim Farron launched a string of attacks on Mrs May. He said: ""Where do you think Theresa May is tonight? ""Take a look out your window. She might be out there sizing up your house to pay for your social care."" At the end of the debate, some of the audience I spoke to were clearly pretty fed up that Theresa May hadn't turned up. In contrast, they were pleased that Jeremy Corbyn had shown his face. For him, that decision seems to have been a tactical win. If elections really are a game, he took the points today. But whether his performance will have the same impact on a wider audience, particularly undecided voters, is a different matter. In the spin room, where the press were watching and senior politicians were trying to claim victory for their competitor, it didn't feel like a wake or a celebration for any party in particular. None of the participants achieved a big breakthrough moment. But nor, crucially, did any of them have a cringing disaster. By polling day, tonight's event may be remembered more for the day that Mrs May didn't show, than anything that was actually said on the platform. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the ""first rule of leadership is to show up"".  She added: ""You don't say it's the most important election of our lifetime and not be bothered to show up."" Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said Mrs May was not there because ""her campaign of soundbites is falling apart"". SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson accused Mrs May of not having the ""guts"" to attend the debate, as he attacked Ms Rudd over cuts to the winter fuel allowance for pensioners in England.  Ms Rudd said the Conservatives had ""made a clear decision to protect the poorest in our society,"" adding that ""winter fuel payments won't be available for billionaires"" under her party's policy. She dismissed her rivals' claims as ""fanciful"", saying they offered nothing but ""bluff, bravado and tempting, shiny election promises"". ""The only question to consider is who should be in No 10 to steer Britain to a brighter future?"" Ms Rudd asked. ""Jeremy Corbyn with his money tree, wish list manifesto and no plan for Brexit or Theresa May with her record of delivery."" The panel also clashed over immigration.  The Green Party's co-leader Caroline Lucas said she wanted to ""make the case"" for freedom of movement across the EU and the ability of people to be able to ""live and love"" in other countries. ""The Britain I love is a confident outward-looking country,"" she said, which well knows the ""benefits"" of migration. The UKIP leader Paul Nuttall denied claims he was demonising immigrants, but said: ""We have to get the population under control."" The panel members also debated security and terrorism, the NHS, and US President Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of climate change agreements. Labour said for weeks that Mr Corbyn would not attend the debate unless Mrs May was there - but he announced at lunchtime that he would take part. Speaking on Thursday morning, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the debate ""validated and confirmed"" Mrs May's decision not to feature, describing the debate as a ""yammering cacophony of voices"". Pressed on her refusal to take part during a campaign visit in Bath, Mrs May said she had taken on Mr Corbyn every week during Prime Minister's Questions, adding that it was ""so important"" to be taking questions from voters. ""That's why I've been doing that up and round the country,"" she added. The debate, moderated by Mishal Husain, was the latest in a series of special broadcasts before the general election on 8 June. This includes two Question Time shows - one on 2 June featuring Mrs May and Mr Corbyn appearing separately, and a second on 4 June with Mr Farron and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon.

"Nasa renames Sun skimming mission The US space agency has renamed its mission to ""touch the Sun"" after a living scientist. The Solar Probe Plus mission will now carry the name of Eugene Parker, who conducted pioneering work on the ""solar wind"" - a stream of charged particles flowing out from the Sun's ""atmosphere"". The spacecraft will swoop to within four million miles of the Sun's surface, enduring temperatures of about 2,500C. The mission is due to launch in 2018. ""Nasa has never named a spacecraft after a researcher during their lifetime,"" said Thomas Zurbuchen, the head of Nasa's science mission directorate. The change, which comes a few days before Prof Parker's 90th birthday, means that Solar Probe Plus, will now be known as the Parker Solar Probe. Plans for solar 'close encounter' Getting ready for the mission to Hell The mission was originally announced in 2009, and is set to launch next year from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on a Delta IV Heavy rocket. Nasa scientist Nicola Fox, commented: ""I like to call it the coolest, hottest mission under the Sun."" The spacecraft will travel through part of the Sun's atmosphere, closer to its surface than any manmade object before. The aim is to better understand the upper layer of this atmosphere, known as the corona. It should also expand our knowledge of the origin and evolution of the solar wind. The spacecraft will be protected from the scorching temperatures by a specially developed carbon-composite shield.

                         The remains of deceased Brazilian football legend Garrincha are missing, members of his family say. The remains of the winger, who died in 1983 aged 49, may have been lost in an exhumation, relatives told O Globo. Garrincha played 50 times for Brazil between 1955 and 1966, helping his nation to World Cup victory in 1958 and 1962, when he shared the golden boot. His daughter Rosangela Santos said: ""My father did not deserve this. It's very upsetting not knowing where he is."" She added: ""The mayor has promised him a mausoleum but they need to find him first."" Garrincha's cousin Joao Rogoginsky told O Globo that when another member of the family died and was buried in the same place 10 years ago, Garrincha's bones were removed to be placed in a niche.  However, he said he did not attend the exhumation and ""the family did not receive any documents"". An administrator of the cemetery in Mage reportedly said: ""There's no certainty that he's buried. We have information that the body was exhumed but there is no document that proves this.""  Local mayor Rafael Tubarao has proposed exhuming the grave again, with the family's permission, to conduct a DNA test on what remains there are. Brazilian cemeteries are usually split into two sections - those with tombs where bodies are buried, and walls with drawer-like concrete niches where ashes or bones are stored.  There are two tombs with Garrincha's name on them, O Globo said. One is a plot where Garrincha was originally laid in 1983 alongside other members of his family. The second is marked with an obelisk and was built in 1985.  Garrincha, which means ""little wren"" in Brazilian Portuguese, was regarded by many as the greatest dribbler of all time.  But his career was blighted by drink problems and he died of of cirrhosis of the liver.

"Paris climate deal: Trump pulls US out of 2015 accord President Donald Trump has announced that the US is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. He said moves to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers would begin. Mr Trump said during last year's presidential election campaign that he would take the step to help his country's oil and coal industries.  Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below""  2C above pre-industrial levels  and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up to the deal. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US. He claimed the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. ""In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States,"" he said. The speech contained several rhetorical flourishes reminiscent of his campaign speeches. ""We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more - and they won't be,"" he said. ""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or re-negotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under re-negotiation."" The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the move will be welcomed by many Trump supporters, as for them this is less about science - and more about sending a signal to so-called global elites.  Analysts say the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement will make it more difficult for the world to reach the goals that it set for itself in the Paris agreement.  The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures.  Mr Trump did not give a timescale for US withdrawal, but White House sources had earlier suggested it could take up to four years. Former US President Barack Obama, who agreed to the Paris deal, immediately criticised the move, accusing the Trump administration of ""rejecting the future"". Republican congressional leaders and the US coal industry backed the move, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supporting Mr Trump ""for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs"".  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision ""one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st Century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing"". The leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement rejecting a renegotiation of the agreement. ""We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,"" it said. Canada was ""deeply disappointed"" by President Trump's decision, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna told reporters.  This was echoed by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who expressed her disappointment and told Mr Trump in a phone call that the deal protects the ""prosperity and security of future generations"". Leaders of the Nordic nations - Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland - also condemned the move. A United Nations spokeswoman said it was a ""major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security"". Small island nations whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels were critical of the move. The President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda Heine, said it was ""highly concerning for those of us that live on the frontline of climate change"". Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk confirmed that he was leaving his role as an adviser to the Trump administration in protest. ""Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,"" he tweeted. By BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath President Trump's statement is a very clear repudiation of the Paris agreement and international efforts to fund climate mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries.  In many ways it is far worse than many had expected. He sees it as a clear job killer, as an economy strangler and a desperately unfair stitch-up by other countries wanting to take economic advantage of the US. He spoke of being open to re-negotiating the deal or trying to build a new agreement - but the idea of ""re-negotiation"" is an unlikely scenario.  The scale of his opposition, seeing the deal as ""a massive redistribution of US wealth to other countries"" is a clear indication that he has fully bought into an economic nationalist and climate denier perspective.  The question of unfairness cropped up again and again, how the world's worst polluters, China and India, had ""no meaningful obligations"" placed on them by the deal.   The overall tone and content of his speech clearly plays to his base but is also a clear disavowal of multilateralism, especially on climate change, and will definitely push other countries more closely together on this issue.  Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere.       The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.

"Resorts World Manila: Gunman sparks panic at Philippines hotel Police in the Philippines have taken control of a hotel and entertainment complex in Manila after it was stormed by a masked gunman.  The gunman is dead, officials said, although it is not clear how he died. It is believed he acted alone and was staging a robbery, police said. Resorts World Manila was in lockdown after the incident, which happened after midnight local time (16:00 GMT).   Several people were reported injured as they fled the hotel in panic. Philippines police chief Ronald dela Rosa said a lone gunman had entered the gaming area at Resorts World, fired at a television and set some gambling tables on fire. Gunshots were fired, he said, but were not aimed at people in the room. The police chief told local radio station DAM the gunman had filled a bag with casino gambling chips.  But he warned that Islamist militants might falsely claim to be behind it to further their propaganda. The Philippine military is currently battling militants allied to so-called Islamic State on the southern island of Mindanao. ""We cannot say this is an act of terror... he [the gunman] did not hurt anyone,"" the police chief said. ""If you are a terrorist you will sow terror."" He added that no visitors to the casino had been shot and that the only injuries were from smoke inhalation, or the stampede that formed as people tried to escape.  Resorts World Manila features multiple hotels and bars, as well as a shopping centre and casino.  Many witnesses took the incident for a militant assault. Marcel Navaro, a Resorts World employee, told DZMM radio he had returned from his break to find people fleeing in panic. ""Guests were screaming. We went to the basement locker room and hid there. People were screaming, guests and employees were in panic. ""When we smelled smoke, we decided to go for the exit in the car park. That's where we got out. Before we exited, we heard two gunshots and there was thick smoke on the ground floor.""   Eyewitness Hessa Isabelle filmed the scene from a nearby balcony and described seeing ""people screaming and running out of the building"". As the situation unfolded, the US state department tweeted a warning to citizens, stating: ""Reports of explosions/gunfire at Resorts World Manila, near the Manila Intl Airport. Avoid area & monitor local news.""  Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which is around a mile (1.6km) from the resort, was placed on lockdown.

"Gravitational waves: Third detection of deep space warping Scientists are reporting yet another burst of gravitational waves.  The signals were picked up by the Advanced LIGO facilities in the US and are determined to have come from the merger of two huge black holes some three billion light-years from Earth.  It is the third time now that the labs' laser instruments have been perturbed by the warping of space-time.  The detection confirms that a new era in the investigation of the cosmos is now truly under way.  ""The key thing to take away from this third, highly confident event is that we're really moving from novelty to new observational science - a new astronomy of gravitational waves,"" said David Shoemaker, spokesperson for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.  The latest detection, which was made at 10:11 GMT on 4 January, is described in a paper accepted for publication in the journal Physical Review Letters.  Once again, it is a merger of black holes, and once again the energy scales involved are extraordinary.  The analysis suggests the two black holes that coalesced had starting masses that were just over 31 times and 19 times that of our Sun. And when they finally came together, they produced a single object of a little under 49 solar masses.  It means the unison radiated a simply colossal quantity of pure energy.  ""These are the most powerful astronomical events witnessed by human beings,"" explained Michael Landry, from the LIGO lab in Hanford, Washington State.  ""In this case two times the mass of the Sun were converted into deformations in the shape of space. This energy is released in a very short space of time, and none of this comes out as light which is why you have to have gravitational wave detectors.""  Gravitational waves - Ripples in the fabric of space-time As with the two previous observations - in September and December 2015 - the scientists are uncertain about where on the sky the 4 January event occurred. From the three millisecond gap between the signal being picked up first at Hanford and then at the second lab in Livingston, Louisiana, researchers can only specify a large arc of possibility for the source.  Conventional telescopes were alerted to go look for a coincident flash of light, but they saw nothing that could be confidently ascribed to the black hole merger.  The LIGO collaboration will only solve this triangulation problem when a third station called VIRGO, in Italy's Pisa province, starts work alongside the US pair this summer.  The detection of gravitational waves has been described as one of the most important physics breakthroughs in recent decades.  Being able to sense the distortions in space-time that occur as a result of cataclysmic events represents a transformative step in the study of the Universe, one that does not depend on sensing electromagnetic radiation in any of its forms - from radio and optical light through to X-rays and gamma rays. Now, as well as trying to ""see"" far-off events, scientists can also ""listen"" to those events as they vibrate the very fabric of the cosmos. And immediately this approach is telling researchers new things. One simple discovery is the recognition of a totally new class of black holes. Before LIGO's discoveries, orbiting pairs of these objects, some of 25 solar masses and greater, were completely unknown.  ""In two years, we've gone from not knowing these systems existed to being really confident there's a whole population of them out there,"" commented Sheila Rowan, a collaboration team member from Glasgow University, UK. ""And it's all consistent with gravitational waves from one of these systems passing through us about once every 15 minutes, from somewhere in the Universe,"" she told BBC News. The quest for the future is to get LIGO to sensitivities where more of these events can be detected. Also possible now are new investigations of the properties of black holes. The scientists can tell from the nature of the 4 January signal that the spins of the objects were not fully aligned when they came together.  This suggests they were not created from a pair of previously orbiting stars that exploded and then collapsed into black holes. Rather, their origin was more probably as stars that led independent lives and only at some end stage fell in as a duo.  ""In that first case, we would expect that the spins would stay aligned,"" said Laura Cadonati, the collaboration's deputy spokesperson. ""So, we have found a new tile to put in the puzzle of understanding formation mechanisms.""  In addition, gravitational wave astronomy permits new tests of Einstein's theories. Because of the greater distance to this merger (twice the distance to the 2015 events), researchers could more easily look for an effect called ""dispersion"".  For light, this describes how electromagnetic radiation of different frequencies will travel at different speeds through a physical medium - to produce a rainbow in a glass prism, for example.  Einstein's general theory of relativity forbids any dispersion from happening in gravitational waves as they move out from their source through space towards Earth.  ""Our measurements are really very sensitive to minute differences in the speeds of different frequencies but we did not discover any dispersion, once again failing to prove that Einstein was wrong,"" explained Bangalore Sathyaprakash, a LIGO team member from Penn State, US, and Cardiff University, UK.  In a poignant coincidence, 4 January was also the day that Heinz Billing, a pioneer of gravitational wave science, died aged 102.  The German physicist and computer expert built one of the first laser interferometers - the instruments now used to detect gravitational waves. His early work is credited with making crucial contributions to the development of the eventual LIGO systems.  ""His group started in about 1975, just before we did it here in Glasgow,"" recalled LIGO collaborator Jim Hough. ""They were following the idea that the American Rai Weiss had had of using multiple beam delay lines, and of course the German detector was absolutely superb. They did fabulous work that has continued in Germany to this day.""

"Elizabeth Wettlaufer admits eight nursing home murders A former nurse has pleaded guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of elderly patients in Ontario care homes. Elizabeth Wettlaufer, 49, also entered a guilty plea in with six counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault, according to media reports.  Police arrested Wettlaufer in October for a string deaths in two nursing homes spanning several years.  Many victims' relatives were in the courthouse for the plea.  The former nurse admitted in a lengthy statement at Ontario Superior Court on Thursday that she fatally injected the victims with insulin, according to journalists who attended the hearing.  The AFP wire service reported that Wettlaufer answered a simple ""yes"" when Justice Bruce Thomas asked if she had committed the premeditated murders. The court heard she had often struggled with strong feelings of anger. The London Free Press newspaper reported how Ms Wettlaufer described ""that red surge"" she felt before killing one patient.  A video of her taped October confession to police was also played before the court during a long session that lasted until late in the afternoon.  Wettlaufer's victims were between the ages 75 and 96 and were killed between 2007-14. ""I have to forgive her, that's the Christian thing to do,"" Andrea Silcox, whose father died in 2007, told media outside the court in Woodstock, Ontario, before Wettlauffer arrived in court.  Wettlaufer resigned from the College of Nurses of Ontario a day after police launched an investigation into the nursing home deaths in September.  The murder victims were five women and three men and were all residents of Caressant Care in Woodstock and Meadow Park in London, Ontario.  In January, police brought six additional charges - four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault - against Wettlaufer for incidents that took place in care homes between 2007-16.

"James Comey, FBI chief fired by Trump, due before Senate next week Ex-FBI director James Comey will give evidence to the US Senate Intelligence Committee on 8 June as part of its investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election. The committee is also looking into whether or not President Donald Trump's campaign team colluded in this. Mr Comey was fired by President Trump last month. He is expected to address reports that Mr Trump tried to get him to drop an FBI inquiry into Russian meddling. However, there is speculation that the president might invoke executive privilege to prevent Mr Comey from testifying.  The committee said Mr Comey would testify in an open session at 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT), followed by a closed session. He is likely to be asked about conversations with Mr Trump in which the president reportedly asked him to drop an investigation into former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned when the details of his telephone conversations with the Russian ambassador to the US were made public. The White House shocked Washington by announcing on 9 May that Mr Comey ""has been terminated and removed from office"". The Trump administration said his handling of the inquiry into defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails was the reason for his dismissal.

"Over 40 people 'die of thirst' in Sahara Desert Survivors say 44 people have died of thirst after their truck broke down in the Sahara Desert in northern Niger, the Red Cross has told the BBC.

"Manchester One Love concert: 'Thousands make false ticket claims' More than 10,000 ""unscrupulous"" people have falsely claimed they were at the scene of the Manchester attack in order to get free tickets for Sunday's benefit concert, Ticketmaster has said. The agency said ""opportunists or touts"" had tried to take advantage of its offer for those who were at the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena. It has said fans at the original show can get into Sunday's event for free. Some 25,000 people applied - but just 14,200 were at the concert on 22 May. Twenty-two people died and 116 were injured in a suicide bombing at the end of Grande's show.  Sunday's concert - One Love Manchester - is expected to raise £2m for the victims and their families. Grande will be joined by stars including Robbie Williams, Little Mix, Take That, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber. The deadline for fans who were at the original concert to apply for free tickets for Sunday was extended twice, eventually closing at 14:00 BST on Thursday. In a statement, Ticketmaster said: ""We have set aside tickets for the 14,200 people who were at the Ariana Grande concert to attend One Love Manchester for free.

Like ""artists"" who get up and paint all day, he added, hackers spend their day attacking adversaries. Mr Putin also denied once again that his administration hacked the US election last year. He added that this activity was ""never"" carried out at the government level and he expressed his belief that hackers could not influence voters' minds. Some US politicians have suggested that Russia may have been involved in an attempt to sway the presidential election. In March, the FBI confirmed that it has been investigating allegations of Russian interference. The probe is examining potential links between Russia and Donald Trump's campaign. President Trump's administration has denied that there was any collusion.

"Trump climate agreement: Rest of world rallies around Paris deal China, the EU and India, which along with the US make up the four biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, have restated their commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Top EU official Donald Tusk said at a summit with China that Brussels and Beijing would step up co-operation. Mr Trump announced the US was leaving for economic reasons, saying the deal would cost American jobs. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would still curb emissions. Amid widespread international condemnation of the US decision, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would ""not judge"" Mr Trump. The Paris agreement commits the US and 194 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C.  The UN World Meteorological Organisation said on Friday that, in the worst scenario, the US pullout could add 0.3C to global temperatures by the end of the century. European Council President Donald Tusk said after meeting Chinese Premier Li Keqiang that the two powers took their responsibilities seriously. ""Today, China and Europe have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the whole planet,"" he told reporters at a joint news conference.  ""The fight against climate change and all the research, innovation and technological progress it will bring will continue with or without the United States,"" he added. Mr Tusk was echoing similar pledges by EU politicians such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said the path set out by Paris was ""irreversible"".  A spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, Hua Chunying, said China was ready to take a leading role in the fight against climate change. ""In the future, China will continue to tackle climate change in all ways, will proactively participate in the multilateral process of tackling climate change and resolutely uphold the global climate management process,"" she said. Indian Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said: ""As far as the Paris accord is concerned... our government is committed, irrespective of the stand of anyone, anywhere in the world.""  The group of the world's 48 least developed countries accused Mr Trump of showing disregard for millions of lives. Scientists have warned the poorest countries across the globe will be the hardest hit by climate change as they lack capacity to cope with extreme weather events. Mr Trump characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US. He said it would cost the US $3tn (£2.3tn) in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. Mr Trump said he was fulfilling his ""solemn duty to protect America and its citizens"". Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US had a ""terrific record on reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions"". The head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said exiting the Paris Agreement did not mean disengagement. ""The president said yesterday that Paris represents a bad deal for this country,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""It doesn't mean that we're not going to continue the discussion to export our innovation, to export our technology to the rest of the world, to demonstrate how we do it better here.""  The Russian president said he thought the US did not need not to abandon the Paris Agreement because it was a ""framework"".     Under the terms of the agreement, the US cannot complete its withdrawal until just weeks after the US presidential election in 2020. US payments to the UN Green Climate Fund, which helps developing countries cope with the effects of climate change, will stop. The US has reportedly so far paid $1bn (£780m) of a $3bn pledge. Mr Trump indicated he was open to another climate deal ""on terms that are fair to the United States"" but the leaders of France, Germany and Italy quickly issued a joint statement rejecting any renegotiation. The Democratic governors of New York, California and Washington states all quickly vowed to respect the terms of the Paris deal. Disney's chief executive Robert Iger and the entrepreneur Elon Musk both resigned from White House advisory councils in opposition to the decision. However, Republican congressional leaders and the US coal industry backed the move, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supporting Mr Trump ""for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs"".  Peabody Energy, America's biggest coal mining firm, said the agreement would have badly affected the US economy. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry, transportation, agriculture and other areas into the atmosphere. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up. Countries agreed to: Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies says the world's average temperature has risen by about 0.8C since 1880, two-thirds of that since 1975. US think tank Climate Interactive predicts that if all nations fully achieve their Paris pledges, the average global surface temperature rise by 2100 will be 3.3C, or 3.6C without the US.

"Does Trump still think climate change is a hoax? For a speech about whether the US should remain a party to the Paris climate accord, Donald Trump's Rose Garden address on Thursday didn't have a whole lot of discussion about, you know, the climate. There was plenty of talk about jobs and the US economy. He offered more than a few expressions of concern over whether other nations were being given an unfair advantage over the US. And then there was that lengthy opening plug for his presidential accomplishments that had nothing to do with the environment whatsoever.  At one point the president made a somewhat oblique reference to current climate science, asserting that even if all nations hit their self-set, non-mandatory greenhouse gas emissions targets under the Paris agreement, it would only result in a reduction of 0.2 degrees in average global temperatures by the year 2100. (The researchers who conducted the study said the number he cited was outdated and misrepresented.) Mr Trump's relative silence on the matter has left reporters wondering whether the president still stands by earlier comments - and tweets - expressing serious scepticism about whether climate change is real. Does he still believe it's a Chinese plot to make the US less competitive, as he tweeted in November 2012? Or that it is a money-making ""hoax"", as he said during a December 2015 campaign rally?"" He's occasionally backed away from such sweeping denunciations. During the first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, he denied having ever blamed the Chinese. In a New York Times interview shortly after his election victory, he said he thinks there's ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate change.  After Mr Trump announced his Paris agreement withdrawal, reporters posed the almost-too-obvious question once again to White House aides tasked with selling the move to the public. Does the president believe human activity contributes to climate change? They asked about it during an on-background session with two administration officials on Thursday afternoon. They asked White House advisor Kellyanne Conway during a television appearance Friday morning. They asked Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt during his press conference on Friday afternoon. Time and time again the answer was some variation of ""I don't know"", ""I can't say"" or ""that's not relevant"". ""We focused on one key issue,"" Mr Pruitt said during one of the multiple times he was pressed on his boss's views. ""Was Paris good or bad for the country?"" On Tuesday Press Secretary Sean Spicer had said he didn't know the president's thoughts about climate change because he hadn't asked him. On Friday he was asked whether he had since had a chance to speak to the president. ""I have not had the opportunity to do that,"" Spicer replied. The rest of the press conference was an extended parlour game to try to get the press secretary to slip and perhaps inadvertently shed some light on Mr Trump's views - to no avail. It's clear at this point that the administration has no interest in clarifying Mr Trump's position on climate change. But why? Confusion can often be a politician's ally. The embattled president needs his core supporters to stick with him through what could be a rough road ahead. Those who don't believe climate change is real can look at the president's past comments as proof their man still stands with them without anyone having to explicitly say so.  That allows the president to insist that he is willing to do something to address climate change - ""renegotiating"" the Paris accord, perhaps - without saying climate change is a problem. It allows him tell the majority of Americans who believe climate change is a real global threat that he is trying to address their concerns.  It allows administration surrogates like Mr Pruitt to tout that the US has lowered its carbon output without acknowledging the only reason this would be a noteworthy accomplishment - human activity affects the global climate. It's a fine line to walk for even the most dextrous of White House communications teams - let alone one that has to be concerned that the next time the president is asked the question, there's no telling what he might say.",Saturday 03 June 2017,3-Jun-17,Does Trump still think it's all a hoax?,The president team sows confusion when asked about Donald Trump's views on global warming,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40128034
"Leo Varadkar: Ireland set to have first gay PM Leo Varadkar is set to become the Republic of Ireland's next taoiseach (prime minister) after winning the leadership of the Fine Gael party. The 38-year-old will become the first gay taoiseach and will also be the country's  youngest ever leader. Mr Varadkar beat his rival, Housing Minister Simon Coveney, with 60% of the votes to lead Fine Gael - the biggest party in the coalition government. He will succeed Enda Kenny as leader of the centre-right party within weeks. Varadkar profiled: Ireland's youngest PM in waiting Mr Varadkar is to contact Mr Coveney to discuss what position he will hold in government and the future of the party. He is also expected to hold talks with Fine Gael's partners in government and with Fianna Fáil next week. The former GP is the son of an Irish nurse and a doctor from India and much of the media coverage of his victory has focused on Mr Varadkar's background, age and sexuality. The former first minister of Northern Ireland, DUP leader Arlene Foster, has spoken on the phone to congratulate Mr Varadkar. He has also received a letter from Prime Minister Theresa May. Following the announcement on Friday evening, the new Fine Gael leader said he was ""honoured"" to accept the ""enormous challenge"" ahead of him with humility. ""If my election shows anything it's that prejudice has no hold in this Republic,"" he said. ""When my father travelled 5,000 miles to build a new home in Ireland, I doubt he ever dreamed his son would grow up to be its leader."" He said Simon Coveney had gained his and the party's admiration for his ""principled and spirited"" campaign and he looked forward to working with him to bring Fine Gael and Ireland forward. ""Any child growing up in Ireland now, I hope, looks at me and my unlikely story and my background, and everything about me, and perhaps says to themselves, that there is no office in this state that I can't aspire to, nothing that they can't do if they believe in themselves,"" he said.  ""But our job as a party is to make sure that every person in our country actually has those opportunities, because we don't have equality of opportunity in this country, there is great inequality of opportunity in this country, but as a party I want to dedicate ourselves to building a republic of opportunity."" He said restoring devolution in Northern Ireland and dealing with Brexit would be immediate priorities. ""Northern Ireland will leave the European Union with the United Kingdom, but we do think there should be special arrangements for Northern Ireland,"" he said.   ""It is a special place and we would like to work with the new executive when it is formed to define what that is.  ""But particularly, what we'd like to see is there to remain as close a relationship as possible between the north and south of Ireland and an invisible or non-existent economic border in particular and Northern Ireland remaining in as many EU programmes as possible."" Mr Varadkar also paid tribute to Mr Kenny for passing on a party and country ""in a much better place than he found it"". The leadership was decided in an electoral college system that gave 65% of the vote to the Fine Gael parliamentary party - made up of 73 TDs (members of the Irish assembly), senators and MEPs. The party's 21,000 rank-and-file members had 25% of the vote, and 235 local representatives had 10%. Mr Varadkar, who came out as gay in the run up to the 2015 same-sex marriage referendum, has been in charge of the welfare system. He has come to personify the liberalisation of a country which was once regarded as one of Europe's most socially conservative nations - homosexuality was illegal until 1993.  However, Mr Varadkar has come under criticism for his comments on progressive issues and workers' rights.  The new Fine Gael leader will have to be endorsed by the independent members of the minority coalition government before he becomes taoiseach. That's expected to happen later this month.  Enda Kenny, 66, who led the party for 15 years and was elected taoiseach in 2011, resigned as Fine Gael leader in May. Voting took place this week around the country. Mr Coveney joked that ""my children will be pleased"" that he lost. ""My message is very clear - it's one of unity"", he said, adding that Fine Gael ""needs to be stronger, not in any way divided. This is a great party"" He said Mr Varadkar had ""the potential to be a hugely successful leader of this party"" and said he would do everything he could to make that happen",Saturday 03 June 2017,3-Jun-17,Ireland set to have first gay PM,"Ireland set to have its first gay prime minister, as Fine Gael chooses Leo Varadkar to succeed Enda Kenny.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40139428

"Child-killer Karla Homolka volunteered at Montreal school One of Canada's most notorious child-killers has been told she can no longer volunteer at a primary school, amid nationwide uproar at news of her role.  Karla Homolka served a 12-year sentence for manslaughter following the rape and murder of two schoolgirls in a case that horrified the country. It emerged this week that she was helping out at her children's private school in Montreal. Homolka, 47, was freed from a maximum security prison in Quebec in 2005. CityNews reported this week that she had been helping supervise kindergarten students at Greaves Adventist Academy. The Christian school has received a flood of complaints from parents and the public.  Homolka and her ex-husband, Paul Bernardo, killed Ontario schoolgirls Kristen French, 15, and Leslie Mahaffy, 14, in the early 1990s.  Homolka also played a part in the 1990 rape and murder of her 15-year-old sister Tammy.  But she was given a relatively light sentence in 1993 after agreeing to testify against Bernardo.  He received a life sentence for murder, kidnapping, forcible confinement and aggravated sexual assault, and remains in jail in Ontario.  After her release from prison, Homolka married her lawyer's brother and they have three children together. The Seventh-day Adventist Church, which runs the Montreal school, announced on Thursday it had changed its policy on volunteers to exclude anyone with a criminal record.  ""We have heard and listened to the concerns of parents and members of the community uncomfortable with recent reports in the media,"" the church said in a statement.  Earlier in the week, a spokesman for the church said they had been aware of Homolka's crimes. A centre-left political leader, Thomas Mulcair of the New Democrats, was lambasted in the press for even daring to raise the question of whether Homolka deserved forgiveness. Relatives of the victims do not believe she has paid her debt to society.  Tim Danson, a lawyer for the French and Mahaffy families, said on Friday that Homolka has not shown a ""scintilla of remorse or contrition"". He said the school had neglected its responsibility to inform parents of her presence.   The Seventh-day Adventist Church operates 43 schools in Canada with 4,362 students in Canada.

"Giant sloth remains found in Los Angeles Fossils found by workers digging a tunnel for a new railway line in Los Angeles have been identified as the remains of a giant sloth and a bison. The ""amazing discovery"" of a sloth's hip bone and a fragment of a bison's radius bone was made about 16ft (5m) below ground in Park Mesa Heights. Scientists say the Harlan's Ground Sloth could have weighed 1,500lb (680kg), and been up to 10ft in length. The sloth and bison species have been extinct for at least 10,000 years. The discovery was made on 16 May and it took scientists at the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum about eight days to identify them. The bison and sloth probably lived about 11,000 to 40,000 years ago, in the late Pleistocene area, according to the Metro press release. Other ancient large mammals that became extinct around the same era - following the last ice age - include massive camels, mastodons and mammoths. The remains of an ancient camel and a mastodon or mammoth were discovered earlier this year during excavation beneath Wilshire Boulevard as the city expanded the Metro's Purple Line.

"Alabama postwoman 'fed nails to dogs' in meatballs A postwoman in northern Alabama faces up to 10 years in jail after she was arrested on suspicion of feeding a dog meatballs that contained metal nails. US Postal Service worker Susanna Dawn Burhans, 47, is charged with aggravated cruelty to animals. She was detained after a two-week investigation.

"Hillary Clinton told to 'move on' from her loss Hillary Clinton has been told it's time to ""move on"" after she added her own party officials to the list of those she blames for her 2016 election loss. Democratic Senator Al Franken told Yahoo News: ""I think she has a right to analyse what happened, but we do have to move on."" Mrs Clinton this week faulted Democratic National Committee (DNC) voter data as ""mediocre to poor"". She has also blamed the FBI, Russia and media. Minnesota Senator Franken said on Thursday: ""We have to move on by proving we are the party that cares about a lot of the people who voted for Donald Trump."" Mrs Clinton, speaking at a conference in California on Wednesday, said: ""I take responsibility for every decision I make - but that's not why I lost."" She said the Democratic party did not help her once she was nominated as their White House candidate. ""I get the nomination, so I'm now the nominee of the Democratic Party,"" she said.  ""I inherit nothing from the Democratic Party. I mean, it was bankrupt.  ""It was on the verge of insolvency. Its data was mediocre to poor, non-existent, wrong.  ""I had to inject money into it."" She added: ""I also think I was the victim of the very broad assumption that I was going to win."" Hillary Clinton joins the 'Trump resistance' But Andrew Therriault, former DNC director of data science, lashed out at Mrs Clinton in a series of tweets that have since been deleted.

He also wrote that the battleground swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, all of which Mrs Clinton lost, never looked ""even close to safe"". The Clinton campaign has been criticised by political experts for not campaigning more frequently in those crucial swing states. ""Her team thought they knew better"", Mr Therriault said. President Donald Trump reacted to Mrs Clinton's complaint by pouring scorn on his old foe.

"Question Time: Corbyn and May face tough grilling Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and Tory leader Theresa May had a tough interrogation from Question Time audience members in an election special. Mrs May faced nurses angry over a pay cap and a woman who had suffered ill treatment in a work assessment. Mr Corbyn was repeatedly asked if he would fire nuclear weapons if Britain was under attack, after ruling out ""first use"" of them. He said it was a ""shame"" Mrs May had refused to debate him ""head-to-head"". The two leaders were questioned consecutively in the 90-minute special on BBC One. During her 45-minute grilling, Mrs May repeated her mantra that ""the only poll that matters is the one that takes place on polling day"" and insisted she was right to have the ""balls"" to go to the country. In a swipe at the prospect of Labour running the country, she said: ""We have a situation at the moment where if Jeremy Corbyn was to get into Number 10, he'd be being propped up by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish nationalists. ""You would have Diane Abbott, who can't add up, sitting around the Cabinet table, John McDonnell, who is a Marxist, Nicola Sturgeon, who wants to break our country up, and Tim Farron, who wants to take us back into the EU - the direct opposite of what the British people want."" Mr Corbyn began by saying there would be ""no deals"" with other parties and condemning Donald Trump's ditching of the Paris climate agreement. The Labour leader said: ""I'm very sorry this is not a debate, this is a series of questions. I think it's a shame the prime minister hasn't taken part in a debate.""  He insisted that his party's manifesto was not just a ""wish list,"" saying it was ""time to invest in our country"".  He was challenged about his approach to Brexit and said the UK would not ""necessarily"" be poorer as a result of leaving the European Union. After a bumpy few days, Theresa May seemed to be more on the front foot this evening, trying to reassert her authority over her campaign.  In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn who had been lapping up the political attention, and setting much of the momentum, seemed almost irritated by the end.  Yet in truth, tonight saw neither of the rivals drop a dramatic clanger, nor neither of them turn out a surprisingly stellar performance. Read Laura's full blog On Brexit, Mr Corbyn defended his team's ability to handle the negotiations, with plans for  immediate legislation to protect the rights of EU nationals in the UK. He said a government led by him would work to ""guarantee trade access to the European markets and protection for the conditions we have achieved through EU membership"". He was repeatedly quizzed about whether he would use nuclear weapons if Britain was under threat, eventually telling one audience member: ""I don't want to be responsible for millions of deaths and neither do you."" The Labour leader has made no secret of his opposition to Trident, but has agreed to press ahead with renewal of the system after being defeated in an internal debate on party policy. He said he would work for a world free of nuclear weapons and ""do everything I can to ensure that any threat is actually dealt with earlier on by negotiations and by talks, so that we do adhere to our obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty"". Mr Corbyn was challenged by an audience member over why he had ""never regarded the IRA as terrorists"". The Labour leader said: ""I have deplored all acts of terrorism by anybody in Northern Ireland or anywhere else.""  The Conservative leader faced questions about her previous support for staying in the EU. ""I did say at the time I thought there were advantages to remaining in the European Union,"" she said, but added that she had not said ""the sky would fall in"" if Britain left. But she said she now wanted to ""deliver on the will of the people"" but also to ""make sure we make a success"" of Brexit. She has also hit back at criticism of her decision not to take on Jeremy Corbyn in a head-to-head debate, saying: ""I don't think seven politicians arguing among themselves is that interesting or revealing."" She faced detailed scrutiny from the audience on her planned social care reforms, after an audience member asked: ""What is the point of us working our whole lives and building up a pension if it's all going to be taken away again to pay for our care should we need it?""  Mrs May insisted the reforms were ""fair"". She also came under fire from nurses over their experience of incomes falling in real terms, as a result of the 1% cap on annual public sector pay rises. She said public money had to be ""managed carefully"". She used attack lines first tried by Home Secretary Amber Rudd in Wednesday's seven-way debate, accusing her rival parties of having a ""magic money tree"" and repeatedly attacking the credibility of shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. One questioner, with mental health issues, was close to tears as she spoke about her experience of a work capability assessment. Mrs May said she would ""make no excuses"" for the way the woman had been treated, saying improvements had to be made to the work capability assessments and that people with mental health issues had to be given ""more support at an early stage"". She also faced questions about the foreign aid budget, education and Paris climate agreement. She said: ""I have spoken to Donald Trump and told him that the UK believes in the Paris agreement.""

"UN imposes targeted sanctions on North Korea The UN Security Council has expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea in response to a series of missile tests conducted by Pyongyang this year. The measures impose a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations.  The council voted unanimously to back the sanctions after weeks of negotiations between the US and China.  Pyongyang has defied a UN resolution banning all nuclear and missile tests. The sanctions resolution was adopted by the 15-member council on Friday.  Among the 14 North Korean officials is Cho Il-u, who leads Pyongyang's foreign espionage operations. The other blacklisted officials are senior members of North Korea's Workers' Party and heads of trading firms funding Pyongyang's military programme. North Korea's strategic rocket force, the Koryo Bank and two trading firms were also added to the list. The Koryo Bank is linked to a party office that manages finances of North Korea's top officials, including leader Kim Jong-un. Pyongyang has been testing its missiles at an unprecedented pace. It says its nuclear programme is defensive and intended to counter US aggression.  But experts fear the tests indicate progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile that could strike the continental US. US President Donald Trump has warned North Korea that America's ""strategic patience"" over the North's nuclear ambitions came to an end. Washington has recently sent its aircraft carrier to the Korean peninsula. At the same time, the US has been negotiating with China - North Korea's ally - to put more pressure on the secretive regime. The UN Security Council first imposed sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in response to its missile and nuclear programmes. The council has since strengthened its measures.",Saturday 03 June 2017,3-Jun-17,UN imposes targeted sanctions on N Korea,"The measure targets 14 officials and four entities, in response to Pyongyang's recent missile tests.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40141243
"Poland air crash probe: Remains of ex-president mixed up Polish investigators say remains of two other people have been found in the coffin of ex-President Lech Kaczynski, who died with dozens of other top officials in a plane crash in 2010. Twenty-seven exhumations have been carried out so far since Poland started a new crash investigation last year. The disaster happened near Smolensk in western Russia, as the government plane was coming in to land in thick fog. Victims' remains were mixed up in 11 other coffins, investigators say. The crash of the Soviet-built Tu-154 jet killed 96 people - the worst such disaster for Poland since World War Two. Senior state and military officials had been on their way to a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, in which more than 20,000 Polish officers were murdered by the Soviet secret police. Russian and Polish investigations concluded that the crash was mainly caused by pilot error. But the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), led by Lech Kaczynski's twin brother Jaroslaw, swept to power in October 2015 elections, and launched a new investigation. Some PiS members believe the plane was brought down by an explosion. Some also claim that the Russian air traffic controllers deliberately misled the crew.  The shadow of the tragedy continues to darken Polish-Russian relations. Poland started the exhumations last year after errors were allegedly found in Russian forensic documents. In all, 83 exhumations are planned. What this painful and shameful discovery shows is that the autopsies on the victims' remains, carried out in Russia in the days after the crash, were inadequate, rushed and flawed. Correctly identifying the victims of a plane crash is difficult. Experts reckon it can take up to a month, due to the massive impact and extent of injuries. In this case, dozens of sealed coffins returned to Poland within five days of the disaster.  The mix-up reflects poorly on Donald Tusk's Polish government at the time. What it doesn't do is bolster the theory promoted by the current PiS government that the plane was brought down by a bomb.  The previous Russian and Polish investigations concluded that the pilots had ignored electronic warnings to ""pull up"" in dense fog, as they tried to get a sighting of the runway. The current investigation, which has been working for 18 months, has failed to produce any credible evidence to support the assassination theory. Nor have the prosecutors, presiding over the exhumations. In a statement on Thursday, Polish Deputy Prosecutor General Marek Pasionek said that in two cases remains had been swapped, while nine other coffins were found to contain various mixed-up remains.  According to Mr Pasionek, citing the results of DNA tests: Magdalena Merta, widow of ex-culture ministry official Tomasz Merta, said the Russian post-mortems showed ""nonchalance in the best case and ill-will in the worst case"". She accused Russia of ""a filthy attitude towards our dead"".

"London attack: Seven killed in vehicle and stabbing incidents Seven people have been killed and at least 48 injured in a terror incident in London in which three male attackers were shot dead by police. A white van hit pedestrians on London Bridge at about 22:00 BST on Saturday, then three men got out and stabbed people in nearby Borough Market. Police said the three men were wearing fake bomb vests. One of those hurt is a police officer who was stabbed after going to help. His injuries are not life-threatening. Political parties have suspended national general election campaigning and the prime minister is chairing a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee. Theresa May described Saturday night's events as ""dreadful"", while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called them ""brutal and shocking"".    Borough Market is an area known for its bars and restaurants which were busy on a warm summer evening. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was ""a deliberate and cowardly attack on innocent Londoners"", but the capital remained the ""safest global city"" and Londoners would not be cowed by terrorism.   It is the third terror attack in the UK in three months following the car and knife attack in Westminster in March, which left five people dead, and the Manchester bombing less than two weeks ago, in which 22 people were killed.  Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said it was believed there were only three attackers involved and the explosive vests they were wearing were ""hoaxes"". One social media user posted a photograph appearing to show an attacker lying on the ground outside a pub in the food market, with the fake vest visible. Among the main developments: BBC reporter Holly Jones, who was on the bridge at the time of the attack, said the van was ""probably travelling at about 50 miles an hour"". ""He swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people. He hit about two people in front of me and then three behind,"" Ms Jones told the BBC News channel.  Another eyewitness, Robbie, was sitting in a taxi opposite the Barrowboy and Banker pub on London Bridge.  ""I saw about 20 or 30 people rushing to get back into the pub and five seconds later a big white van came screeching down the pavement,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Two or three people jumped out. Initially, I thought it was a road traffic incident and the people had jumped out to see if anyone was injured, but I could tell immediately, they looked very aggressive.""   His friend Josh came out of the pub a few seconds later and saw people running up to the bridge from Borough Market.  ""A chap ran up and I heard him shout, 'He's got a knife, he's stabbing people.'""  Another witness, Gerard, told the BBC: ""They were running up shouting, 'This is for Allah.' They stabbed this girl maybe 10 times, 15 times. She was going, 'Help me, help me.'"" Gerard said he chased the attackers, who were running into pubs and bars, and threw bottles, chairs and other items to try to stop them. Steven Gibbs, who was drinking in St Christopher's Inn, just metres from the scene, told the BBC: ""A black cab drove past and the driver shouted, 'Terrorist attack, run!'  ""I stood up to take a look and then all of a sudden there were gunshots. Lots of people were screaming."" Steven was taken into the basement of the bar before the police came in and told everyone inside to run. ""I've never been so scared in my life,"" he said, No-one has been able to clean up the empty pint glasses on the tables outside Belushi's bar on Borough High Street - a stark reminder of what happened in London Bridge last night. It's 8am and dozens of police cars and cordons remain in the area, blocking anyone from walking up to Borough Market, where the tragedy unfolded. Dozens of people wait by the police cut-off areas in a confused state trying to work out how to get home or to work.  But no-one is prepared to give up. There is a determined resilience in the air with nurses and railway workers walking miles out of their way to try to get to their jobs. Security officer Mohammed Osman, who works on Borough High Street, had to wait for an hour before he was allowed through to his place of work. He said: ""I'm not feeling worried. I'm strong enough. These enemies are trying to divide us but we have to be together."" Analysis by Dominic Casciani, home affairs correspondent With three attacks in close proximity, terrorism against soft targets is beginning to feel, to some people, like the new normal.  The brutal reality is that this kind of threat is absolutely typical of what jihadists sought to achieve in all their attacks across Europe. Since 2013 security services in the UK have foiled 18 plots. A large proportion of those have involved suspects who set out to commit acts of violence similar to the attack on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. Plans to use bombs, such as at Manchester Arena, are rarer because plotters need to have the technical skills for such an appalling attack - but attacking people with cars and knives is far easier and has long been encouraged by so-called Islamic State and other jihadists.  The aim of the three attackers last night is abundantly clear - not only did they want to kill, but they almost wanted to lose their own lives.  They would've known full well that attacking people in the street would draw armed police in their direction and the fake bomb belts they were wearing would, in their own warped minds, hasten their demise.  A bomb disposal team was later called to Borough Market and local residents told to leave their homes.

"Trump climate deal: Modi vows to go beyond Paris accord Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed his country will go ""above and beyond"" the 2015 Paris accord on combating climate change. Speaking at a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Modi described the agreement as part of ""our duty to protect Mother Earth"". Several global leaders have criticised President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris accord. Mr Trump said the deal would impoverish the US and cost American jobs. The Paris agreement commits the US and 194 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C. China and the European Union have restated their commitment to the agreement, while Mr Macron called Mr Trump's decision a ""mistake both for the US and for our planet"". Speaking after a meeting with Mr Macron, Mr Modi said France and India had ""worked shoulder to shoulder"" on the Paris accord. ""The Paris agreement is the common heritage of the world. It is a gift that this generation can give,"" Mr Modi said. India is the world's fourth-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, after China, the US and the EU. Explaining his decision to withdraw from the deal, Mr Trump said it would cost the US $3tn (£2.3tn) in lost GDP while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. However, several US governors and mayors have vowed to respect the terms of the Paris deal despite the US pulling out.  Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry, transportation, agriculture and other areas into the atmosphere. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up. Countries agreed to: Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies says the world's average temperature has risen by about 0.8C since 1880, two-thirds of that since 1975.

"Mosul battle: 'Dozens of civilians killed' fleeing IS-held district Dozens of civilians have been killed in Mosul while fleeing a district held by so-called Islamic State (IS) in the Iraqi city, reports say. A Reuters TV crew found the bodies of men, women and children lying in a street in the Zanjili district. It is not clear how exactly the civilians were killed. A US aid worker was quoted as saying that IS had been shooting people trying to escape.  The Iraqi army began a major offensive to take back Mosul in October. It is being supported by air and ground strikes from a US-led coalition. The Iraqi authorities have so far made no public comments on the latest reports. The Reuters TV crew reported seeing dead bodies lying on Saturday in Zanjili - one of three frontline districts still in the hands of IS. ""Over the past two days ISIS (Islamic State) has been shooting people escaping this area,"" Dave Eubank from the Free Burma Rangers relief association told the news agency. He described seeing more than 50 bodies, but said they had managed to rescue a little girl and a man.  Some of those trying to escape have reportedly been injured in a coalition air strikes targeting IS fighters. Hundreds of other civilians - some wounded and some carrying apparently dead bodies wrapped in blankets - had managed to reach the government lines, Reuters reported. IS militants want to keep civilians around them - making it harder for the advancing government troops to pick out and target the gunmen. Local people have been extremely vulnerable as the attacking government forces and their US-led coalition allies have closed in.   In March, the US military acknowledged that aircraft of the coalition fighting IS hit a location in west Mosul where dozens of civilians were reportedly killed. The northern Iraqi city of Mosul fell to IS in 2014 and is its last major urban stronghold in Iraq. Pro-government forces took full control of the eastern half of Mosul in January and started an assault on the west the following month. Fewer than a few hundred militants are now believed to be besieged in north-western districts, including the Old City, along with as many as 450,000 civilians. More than 580,000 civilians have fled the city since the operation to recapture it began, according to the Iraqi government.  Most have taken refuge in nearby camps and reception centres. Others have gone to stay with relatives and friends. There is also deep concern for the thousands of people who remain in western Mosul. Food supplies are very low and clean drinking water is in very short supply. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians. At least 2,014 have been killed and 1,516 injured across Nineveh province since the start of October. Iraq's military does not release casualty figures, but a US general said at the end of March that 774 Iraqi security personnel had been killed and 4,600 wounded.",Sunday 04 June 2017,4-Jun-17,'Dozens of civilians shot' fleeing Mosul,"Reporters found the bodies of men, women and children in a street held by so-called Islamic State.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40146724

"Malaysia gay 'prevention' competition seeks videos The Malaysian government has defended its decision to encourage young people to make videos about ""preventing"" homosexuality.  A competition launched on the health ministry's website offers up to $1,000 (£780) for the best videos tackling ""gender confusion"".  Responding to an outcry from LGBT activists, the health ministry said that its aim was to promote creativity, not to discriminate.  The contest is for 13- to 24-year-olds. Their entries should explore prevention and control; issues and consequences; and how to get help, said the ministry's website.  In a statement, Deputy Director-General of Health Lokman Hakim Sulaiman said: ""This creative video competition is purely to tap knowledge and creativity of adolescents on sexual and reproductive health related matters and does not intend to create discrimination to any particular group.""  The competition, which closes at the end of August, has three main categories: gender confusion, sex, and sex and the internet.  The guidelines cited gay and lesbian people, transgender people and tomboys as examples of people who suffered from ""gender confusion"". ""The very fact that they lump LGBT people under a category called 'gender confusion' shows that the authorities are very much confused themselves,"" activist Pang Khee Teik told AFP news agency. ""It is mind-blowing that a government agency wants the whole country to be sucked into its confluence of confusion,"" he said.  ""I was shocked. This is encouraging discrimination, hatred and even violence towards the minorities,"" transgender activist Nisha Ayub told Reuters.

"Kabul blast: Deadly explosions at protest victim's funeral Suicide bombers have killed at least seven people at the funeral in Kabul of a man who died during a protest on Friday, Afghan officials say. More than 100 were wounded in the attack, which hit the funeral of one of five people killed when police fired on a march against deteriorating security. The chief executive of Afghanistan, Abdullah Abdullah, survived the attack.  The latest violence comes as much of Kabul is in lockdown and amid popular anger at the government.  Officials had warned people to stay away from demonstrations, saying they might be attacked by militants. Checkpoints have been set up in central Kabul, and armoured vehicles are patrolling the streets. In a televised address, Mr Abdullah said three suicide bombers were among the mourners attending the funeral of a senator's son who was killed in Friday's protest. He said that an investigation must determine how the attack happened. No group has said it was behind it and the Taliban denied their involvement. President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter: ""The country is under attack. We must be strong and united."" He later said: ""We must not let ourselves fall into the trap that the enemies have spread to our country."" Rahmatullah Begana, who was at the funeral, said the first explosion went off at the start of the ceremony. ""A few minutes later, there was another explosion. I saw a lot of people on the ground covered with blood,"" he said. Another witness told AFP news agency that ""people were blown to pieces"". Kabul has now had three deadly incidents in four days. Residents are still reeling from the aftermath of the huge suicide attack which killed over 90 people earlier this week.   Anger at the government for not doing more to prevent that attack led to protests on Friday. Now the funeral of one of those victims has been targeted, presumably by a militant group.  A number of high-profile politicians were present at the funeral today. The fact that even they are not immune to the rising violence shows the scale of the threat in the city.  Kabul was once considered the most secure part of Afghanistan. Now it seems the most dangerous.  Friday's protest followed a bomb attack on Wednesday which killed 90 people in the city's diplomatic district. Afghan intelligence officials have blamed the Haqqani network, a Taliban affiliate with alleged links to Pakistan. The Taliban denied any role and there has been no comment from so-called Islamic State militants, who are usually quick to claim attacks. More than a third of Afghanistan is now said to be outside government control. The US has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, while another 5,000 from Nato allies are in the country.",Sunday 04 June 2017,4-Jun-17,Bombers kill mourners at Kabul funeral,Three suicide bombers target funeral of man killed at Friday's march against deteriorating security.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40142606
"Theresa May: Tory tax plans have not changed Theresa May has insisted Tory tax plans have not changed after a senior cabinet minister signalled there would be no income tax increase for higher earners. The prime minister said it was her party's ""firm intention to reduce taxes on ordinary working families"". But Sir Michael Fallon said in the Daily Telegraph that there would be no rise in income tax for higher earners. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservatives' tax policies were in ""chaos"". The Conservative manifesto scrapped a pledge made by David Cameron in 2015 not to raise VAT, national insurance or income tax. Speaking in West Yorkshire Mrs May said: ""Our position on tax hasn't changed. We have set it out in the manifesto. ""What people will know when they go to vote on Thursday is that it is the Conservative party that always has been and is and always will be a low tax party and it is our firm intention to reduce taxes for ordinary working families."" However, in his Telegraph interview, Sir Michael appeared to go further than Mrs May. He said voting Conservative was ""the only way"" people could be sure income tax would not be hiked. Asked if high earners could confidently vote Conservative next week, safe in the knowledge that their income tax would not go up, Sir Michael said: ""Yes. ""You've seen our record. We're not in the business of punishing people for getting on, on the contrary we want people to keep more of their earnings. ""The only way they can be sure their taxes won't rise is to vote Conservative. We already know your tax will go up if you vote Labour on Thursday."" The Conservative manifesto had committed the party to keeping tax ""as low as possible"" but had not ruled out increases in income tax. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson later told BBC's Newsnight: ""We will bear down on taxation and we have absolutely no plans to raise income tax. Our plans are to cut taxes. Labour's plans are to put them up."" Former Conservative work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith told BBC Breakfast the party was trying to get away from the ""idea that you set out every single thing in detail saying we won't do this, we won't do that, we won't do the other because then you get a large shopping list"".  At the 2015 general election, David Cameron promised that income tax, National Insurance, and VAT - the so-called ""triple lock"" - would not go up under a Conservative government.  That promise led to a U-turn earlier this year when Mrs May's government had to ditch plans to raise National Insurance contributions for the self-employed.  The Tories have pledged not to raise VAT but to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 and raise the minimum earnings for the 40p higher rate to £50,000 by 2020. Sir Michael Fallon's comments were a signal to the Tory base - designed to reassure core supporters that their taxes wouldn't go up under the Conservatives and make sure they turn out to vote. There is no firm commitment though, no promise in writing unlike in the party's previous manifesto.  And Theresa May didn't go as far as her defence secretary, declining to make a new pledge - suggesting this isn't something she wants to be held to. Labour have seized on the discrepancy as a sign of Conservative confusion - with Jeremy Corbyn reminding voters of his claim that 95% would pay no more tax if he won power. All parties are fighting hard in these last few remaining days of campaigning to make sure their key messages get through. Opposition parties seized on Sir Michael's comments. ""One minister says they're going to give no more tax rises - indeed possibly tax reductions for the very wealthiest - then they can't answer the question about tax rises for the rest of the population,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""Let's be clear - what Labour are offering is no tax rises or national insurance rises or VAT rises for 95% of the population.""   Former Lib Dem business secretary Sir Vince Cable asked where the money was coming from to pay for Sir Michael's apparent promise. ""Since they are ruling out increases in income, corporate tax and VAT we must assume that there will be an increase in national insurance and in various 'stealth taxes' yet to be specified. It undoubtedly raises suspicions,"" he said. The SNP's Stewart Hosie said Sir Michael had ""let the cat out of the bag"", adding: ""Tory plans for a tax freeze for the richest in society were clearly airbrushed out of their manifesto."" Labour has promised to raise the income tax rate to 45p for earnings above £80,000 and to 50p for each pound earned over £123,000. It says it will not raise income tax for those earning less than £80,000. It says the planned rises for higher earners will help fund billions of pounds of investment for schools and the NHS and an expansion of free childcare, in what it calls a ""programme of hope"". Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have pledged to increase income tax by a penny to help pay for the NHS, social care and mental health. The SNP says it would support the idea of raising the top rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 from 45p to 50p. It says there would be no increase in taxation on the low paid, in national insurance or in VAT. Whereas, the Green Party wants to implement a wealth tax on the top 1% of earners and introduce a ""Robin Hood"" tax on financial transactions.",Sunday 04 June 2017,4-Jun-17,UK PM May defends tax plans,Theresa May was speaking after a senior Tory minister appeared to signal no tax rises for high earners.,http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40141470

"South Africa opposition party suspends Helen Zille over colonialism tweets South Africa's main opposition party has suspended its former leader after she tweeted that colonialism was not all bad. The leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) said Helen Zille's remarks undermined its reconciliation project. The party is holding a disciplinary hearing on the case. The anti-Apartheid activist could face expulsion. Her tweets led to a storm of criticism in March. It is feared they have affected the party's electoral chances. Ms Zille, a major political figure in South Africa, has not yet commented on the decision.  She will retain her elected post as premier of Western Cape province, a DA stronghold and the only province not governed by the African National Congress.  DA leader Mmusi Maimane, who took over from Ms Zille in 2015, said that her suspension was pending the outcome of the disciplinary hearing. ""We live in a fragile democracy. Our public representatives must be sensitive to the legitimate anger that people still feel about our past and its legacy,"" he said in a series of tweets. ""I asked Helen Zille to tender an unreserved apology to both South Africa and the DA for damage she has done. Unfortunately, she declined.""  However, after the criticism, she sent a tweet saying: ""I apologise unreservedly for a tweet that may have come across as a defence of colonialism. It was not."" The DA had been under pressure to sanction Ms Zille for her comments.  It is desperate to dismiss the impression that it largely represents white interests in South Africa, BBC Africa editor James Copnall says. Mr Maimane, a young and charismatic black leader, has sought to make the party more attractive to the black majority, our correspondent adds. The DA won 22% of the vote in the 2014 general election, coming second to the governing ANC. It is hoping to build on its success in local polls in 2016 as it prepares for the presidential election due in 2019.",Sunday 04 June 2017,4-Jun-17,Suspension over SA colonialism tweets,"Helen Zille, ex-leader of South Africa's opposition DA party, had said colonialism was not all bad.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40143710
"Prostate cancer treatment 'could help more patients' One of the largest clinical trials for prostate cancer has given ""powerful results"", say UK researchers. A drug for treating prostate cancer that has spread was found to save lives when offered earlier, a study found. The trial looked at abiraterone as an additional treatment in patients with prostate cancer who were about to start long-term hormone therapy. Abiraterone improved survival, according to results published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Prof Nicholas James, from the University of Birmingham, who led the research, said: ""These are the most powerful results I've seen from a prostate cancer trial - it's a once-in-a-career feeling.  ""This is one of the biggest reductions in death I've seen in any clinical trial for adult cancers."" Abiraterone, also known as Zytiga, is a hormone therapy. Unlike chemotherapy which kills the cancerous cells, it stops more testosterone from reaching the prostate gland to stifle the tumour's growth. The trial involved almost 2,000 patients. Half the men were treated with hormone therapy while the other half received hormone therapy and abiraterone.  Of the 1,917 men in the trial, there were 184 deaths in the combination group compared with 262 in those given hormone therapy alone. Prof James added: ""Abiraterone is already used to treat some men whose disease has spread but our results show many more could benefit.""  Each year around 46,500 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK, and around 11,000 men die from the disease.  The results of the trial were presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting in Chicago and published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Saturday.  Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: ""These results could transform the treatment of prostate cancer. Abiraterone can clearly help many more prostate cancer patients than was first thought."" The Institute of Cancer Research also ""strongly welcomed"" the new findings. Prof Johann de Bono said they showed that when used at the start of treatment, abiraterone had ""clear benefits for patients"". In March, patients with prostate cancer in England were told they could have early access to abiraterone. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) previously said the treatment was not cost-effective for the NHS until cancers were more advanced. Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said he was keen to now see abiraterone reassessed by NICE for use in patients ""as early as possible"".

"Comedian Bill Maher apologises for racial slur on live TV Comedian Bill Maher has apologised for using a racial slur on live television. The host of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" on HBO used a derogatory term for African-Americans while interviewing Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse.  The ""joke"" prompted a huge backlash, particularly on social media. Maher said he used the slur in the ""banter of a live moment"". ""The word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry,"" he said in a statement released the next day. The controversy arose during a segment of the show when Maher was interviewing the Republican Senator Ben Sasse. This story contains language that readers may find offensive. When Maher said he should visit Nebraska more, the senator quipped: ""You're welcome - we'd love to have you work in the fields with us."" ""Work in the fields?"" Maher replied. ""Senator, I'm a house nigger,"" he said. The comedian immediately backpedalled as the remark was met with a muted response from the audience. ""No, it's... it's a joke,"" he said, turning to the crowd. The controversy quickly became a national trending topic on social media in the United States. The interview continued without further interruption, but Senator Sasse later tweeted that he wished he'd been ""quick enough"" to challenge Maher. ""Free speech comes with a responsibility to speak up when folks use that word. Me just cringing last night wasn't good enough,"" he said. Maher's network, HBO, also criticised his ""joke"" as ""completely inexcusable and tasteless,"" and said the network would edit it out from re-runs of the show. Later, Maher released a statement to the press. ""Friday nights are always my worst night of sleep because I'm up reflecting on the things I should or shouldn't have said on my live show,"" he said. ""Last night was a particularly long night as I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment. The word was offensive and I regret saying it and am very sorry."" In a 2015 interview with Variety magazine, Maher acknowledged the risk he takes in going live, rather than pre-recording like some of his television rivals. ""Live on tape means 'not live,' of course. It was live at some point. The difference with our show is it is 'live' live,"" he said.  ""As I'm saying it, you are seeing it. It does add an extra, kind of tightrope element to it, because you can't take anything back or editorially fudge it. It is what it is.""",Sunday 04 June 2017,4-Jun-17,Bill Maher apologises for racial slur,"The comedian used the n-word on live television, during what he called ""banter of a live moment"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40146594
"London attack: 12 arrested in Barking after van and knife attack Twelve people have been arrested after the London terror attack which left seven people dead and 48 injured. The arrests in Barking, east London, followed a raid at a flat belonging to one of the three attackers. A van hit pedestrians on London Bridge at 21:58 BST on Saturday. Three men then got out and stabbed people in nearby Borough Market. The attackers were shot dead by eight officers who fired 50 bullets. A member of the public was accidentally shot. Of the 12 people who were arrested, seven are women. A 55-year-old man was later released without charge. Meanwhile, Canadian national Chrissy Archibald has been named by Canadian broadcaster CTV as the first victim of the attack. A statement from her family said she ""believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected"". It said she had worked in a homeless shelter until she moved to Europe to be with her fiance. The so-called Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said the police had reacted knowing the attackers ""had to be stopped immediately"". ""The situation these officers were confronted with was critical, a matter of life and death - three armed men wearing what appeared to be suicide belts,"" he said. The vests were later found to be hoaxes. Mr Rowley said 36 people were in hospital with a ""range of injuries"" and 21 were in a critical condition. Malik Ramadhan, a doctor at the Royal London Hospital, said his team had treated one man who had been shot in the head and was expected to make a full recovery. Both London Bridge rail and Tube stations are due to reopen on Monday from 05:00 BST but the rail station will be exit only, Network Rail said. The mother of 23-year-old Daniel O'Neill, who is recovering in hospital after being stabbed, told the BBC he had a seven-inch scar from the knife attack. ""He had just stepped outside the bar for a second and a man ran up to him and said 'this is for my family, this is for Islam' and stuck a knife in him,"" Elisabeth O'Neill said. ""I'm still in shock. I can't quite believe it's happened."" Sunday Express journalist and martial arts expert, Geoff Ho, who was injured, said that he helped defend a bouncer from the attackers outside the Southwark Tavern as it ""isn't happening on my watch"", his newspaper reported. Controlled explosions were carried out at the flat in Barking during the raids on Sunday morning. According to neighbours, the dead attacker lived there for about three years and was married with two children. One man, who did not want to be named, told the BBC's Asian Network that one of the attackers had become more extreme over the past two years. ""We spoke about a particular attack that happened and like most radicals he had a justification for anything - everything and anything.  ""And that day I realised that I need to contact the authorities,"" he said. He said no action was taken. ""I did my bit... but the authorities didn't do their bit,"" he said. It is the third terror attack in the UK in three months, following the car and knife attack in Westminster in March, in which five people were killed, and the Manchester bombing less than two weeks ago, in which 22 people were killed.  Most political parties have suspended national general election campaigning, but the prime minister said full campaigning would resume on Monday. The general election will go ahead as planned on Thursday.  Condemning the attack, Theresa May said it was ""time to say enough is enough"". Eyewitnesses described a van travelling at high speed along London Bridge, hitting pedestrians, before crashing close to the Barrowboy and Banker pub. The white Renault van used was recently hired by one of the attackers, Mr Rowley said. Four police officers who tried to stop the attack were among those injured, two of them seriously. One of them was an off-duty officer and amateur rugby player who tackled one of the terrorists, suffering stab wounds.  Another, a British Transport Police officer who joined the force less than two years ago, took on the attackers armed with only his baton. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick praised their ""extraordinary bravery"". The three suspects were shot dead within eight minutes of the first 999 call being received. Among the other developments: BBC reporter Holly Jones, who was on the bridge, said the van was ""probably travelling at about 50 miles an hour"" and hit ""five or six people"".  According to another witness, Eric, the men inside jumped out once the van crashed and ""ran towards the people that they nearly ran over"". ""[Then] they literally just started kicking them, punching them, they took out knives... it was a rampage really,"" he said. One man, Gerard, told the BBC he saw a woman being stabbed ""10 or 15 times"" by men shouting ""This is for Allah"". Steven Gibbs, who was drinking in a pub metres from the scene, told the BBC: ""A black cab drove past and the driver shouted, 'Terrorist attack, run!'  ""I stood up to take a look and then all of a sudden there were gunshots. Lots of people were screaming."" Hundreds of people were stranded after being unable to return to their homes and hotels. As with the Manchester attack, there were stories of Londoners coming to each other's aid, offering free taxi rides, free accommodation or just the opportunity to call friends and family - many using the hashtag on social media #sofaforLondon.  Speaking in Downing Street after a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee, the prime minister said the country ""cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are"". Mrs May said there was ""too much tolerance of extremism in our country"" and while it would involve ""some difficult and embarrassing conversations"", that must change. In a speech, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn backed the police to use ""whatever force is necessary"" to save lives. All through the night, supporters of so-called Islamic State celebrated the London attack, even before any claim was made by IS.  There was never much doubt either in their minds, or in those of British counter-terrorism officials, that this was a jihadist attack inspired by IS.   It follows a widely-circulated propaganda message put out by the group on social media urging its followers to attack civilians in the West using trucks, knives or guns.  The message makes reference to the current Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Last year, attacks intensified during this month with deaths resulting in Istanbul, Dhaka and Baghdad.  Some analysts see this as a last desperate bid by IS to its supporters, following multiple setbacks in the Middle East where its self-proclaimed caliphate is shrinking fast.  But the ideology of IS is likely to survive those defeats - and will continue to fuel terrorist attacks around the world. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the capital remained the ""safest global city"" and would not be cowed by terrorism.   Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said Muslims everywhere were ""outraged and disgusted at these cowards who once again have destroyed the lives of our fellow Britons"".  With three attacks in three months, terrorism against soft targets is beginning to feel, to some people, like the new normal.  The brutal reality is that this kind of threat is absolutely typical of what jihadists sought to achieve in all their attacks across Europe. Since 2013 security services in the UK have foiled 18 plots. A large proportion of those have involved suspects who set out to commit acts of violence similar to the attack on Westminster Bridge and London Bridge.  Plans to use bombs, such as at Manchester Arena, are rarer because plotters need to have the technical skills for such an appalling attack - but attacking people with cars and knives is far easier and has long been encouraged by so-called Islamic State and other jihadists.  The aim of the three attackers last night is abundantly clear - not only did they want to kill, but they wanted to lose their own lives.  They would've known full well that attacking people in the street would draw armed police in their direction and the fake bomb belts they were wearing would, in their own warped minds, hasten their demise.  The police are asking anyone with photographs or videos of the incident to upload them here. The area around the attack scene remains cordoned off, with London Bridge closed.  Police said the cordon would remain in place overnight and ""well into Monday"" and people would not be able to access their properties until it was lifted.",Monday 05 June 2017,5-Jun-17,Police arrest 12 after London terror attack,Seven people were killed and 48 others injured in a terrorism attack in London on Saturday night. ,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40148737

"London attacks: Mayor Sadiq Khan dismisses Trump criticism The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has dismissed criticism from US President Donald Trump over his response to Saturday's terror attack. The attack in London Bridge and Borough Market killed seven and injured 48. Mr Trump accused Mr Khan of downplaying the attack by telling Londoners there was ""no reason to be alarmed"". Mr Khan's team said he had ""more important things to do than respond to Mr Trump"", who had ""deliberately"" taken his remarks ""out of context"". ""The Mayor is busy working with the police, emergency services and the government to co-ordinate the response to this horrific and cowardly terrorist attack and provide leadership and reassurance to Londoners and visitors to our city,"" Mr Khan's spokesperson added. On Saturday night, following the attack, Mr Trump tweeted a message of support to the UK, but also sparked controversy after he called for his travel ban on visitors from six predominantly Muslim countries to be upheld by US courts. On Sunday, he criticised Mr Khan, writing: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" His tweet angered many in the UK, who pointed out Mr Khan had been referring to increased police numbers on the streets. During an interview earlier on Sunday, Mr Khan had said: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed.""  Mr Khan had also said: ""One of the things the police and all of us need to do is ensure that we're as safe as we possibly can be.  ""I'm reassured that we are one of the safest global cities in the world, if not the safest global city in the world, but we always evolve and review ways to make sure we're as safe as we possibly can."" Following the attack, Mr Trump also tweeted that ""we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people"", and that there was no gun debate after the attack ""because they used knives and a truck"". Later on Sunday, Mr Trump visited the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia for the second time over the weekend.  Mr Trump and Mr Khan have clashed several times in the past. During the US presidential campaign last year, Mr Trump first proposed the ban on Muslims entering the US, but suggested he could make an exception for Mr Khan, who is London's first Muslim mayor. Mr Khan rejected the offer, saying: ""It's not about me, it's about my friends, family and others from all around the world."" Mr Khan also accused Mr Trump of being ""ignorant"" about Islam and making both the US and UK ""less safe"". Mr Trump responded by challenging Mr Khan to an IQ test, and said he was offended by Mr Khan, adding: ""He doesn't know me, never met me... I will remember those statements.""",Monday 05 June 2017,5-Jun-17,London mayor rebuffs Trump criticism,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan's team say he has ""more important things to do than respond to Mr Trump"".",http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40152637
"One Love Manchester: Joy shines through pain at benefit concert The benefit concert held in the wake of the Manchester attack turned into a night of unity, healing and joy for 50,000 music fans. The all-star show was held to remember the victims of the suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. Despite the circumstances, a celebratory atmosphere prevailed as Grande herself returned to the stage. She told the crowd: ""I want to thank you for coming together and being so loving and strong and unified."" She added: ""I love you guys so much, and I think that the kind of love and unity that you're displaying is the medicine that the world really needs right now."" Visibly moved at times, the 23-year-old US singer performed with Miley Cyrus and the Black Eyed Peas, while other highlights were provided by Katy Perry, Coldplay, Robbie Williams, Liam Gallagher and Justin Bieber. The concert at Old Trafford cricket ground was watched by an average of 10.9 million viewers, peaking at 14.5 million as the gig drew to a close. Ciara Lynch, 15, from Wigan, was at the Manchester Arena show that was attacked, but said she ""didn't think about it really"" during Sunday's concert. She said the One Love Manchester concert was ""amazing"", adding: ""It was emotional at the same time. ""When she sang One Last Time, I cried then. But everyone was so close, even if they didn't know each other. It was really good."" Her friend Lauren Bromelow, also 15, said it felt like everybody at the show had ""come together as a family"". Sarah Stones, 25, from Salford, Greater Manchester, came ""very, very close to cancelling"" - but said she was reassured by the heavy police presence. Describing the mood of the night, she said: ""This was all happiness. You're all as one. You're one team. ""Every single time an emotional song came on, it really hit us. I have no words for Manchester tonight."" Her friend Jamal Iddi, 23, from Tameside, said the attack on 22 May ""hit everyone in the city"". He said: ""Anyone who lives in Manchester feels the pain. And this was a very, very good way to remember and keep on remembering the people who have passed away."" It wasn't just the fans who got into the spirit of the show. Police officers danced, medics sang along and one lively steward encouraged the crowd to clap and dance. Grande made appearances throughout the show. She sang My Everything with students from Parr's Wood High school in Manchester, comforting 12-year-old soloist Natasha Seth when she was overcome with emotion. She also told the crowd how she changed the set list at the last minute after meeting the mother of Olivia Campbell-Hardy, 15, who was among the 22 people who died in the attack. Grande said: ""She told me Olivia would have wanted to hear the hits. We had a totally different show planned and we had a rehearsal yesterday and we changed everything."" She also performed Oasis' Don't Look Back In Anger with Coldplay's Chris Martin before Martin accompanied former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher on Live Forever.  Speaking in his home city, Gallagher dedicated the song to ""the beautiful people who were killed and injured"" in the attack. At the end of the show, Grande was joined on stage by the night's other stars to perform the song One Last Time before finishing with a poignant solo rendition of Over the Rainbow. Grande wore a One Love Manchester sweatshirt - and many of the fans wore shirts bearing similar messages, or face paint saying ""I heart MCR"", or #WeStandTogether stickers. Organisers said the night had raised £2m for victims and families through text and online donations, taking the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund's total to more than £10m.

"Canada tornado: Alberta lawn-mowing man defies twister A picture of a man in Canada calmly mowing his lawn with a menacing tornado swirling in the background has gone viral on social media. Theunis Wessels was ""fully aware"" of the twister but ""wasn't worried at all"", his wife Cecilia, who took the photo, told the BBC. She said the tornado was about 2km (1.25 miles) from their house in Three Hills, Alberta - much further away than it appeared in the photo. The storm was quickly gone, she added. Mrs Wessels told the BBC she was sleeping in the house on Friday - but then was woken by her nine-year-old daughter who was concerned that her father would not abandon his lawn-mowing and hide inside from the tornado. ""My daughter was the most upset, saying 'Mum, what we gonna do?'"" Mrs Wessels came outside to check on her husband, who continued mowing. He said ""Everything is OK,"" and he looked ""calm, in control,"" she recollected. She added that he had some knowledge about twisters as he had recently attended a seminar organised by a storm-chasing association. Many town residents were taking pictures of the tornado, and Mrs Wessels decided to post hers on Facebook and also sent them to her mother in South Africa.  She said her mother was very worried about her son-in-law, asking: ""Why are you letting him outside? Please stay safe."" Very soon the picture began causing a storm on the social media.  One user wrote: ""This is the craziest picture! Lol. I'm glad that the tornado didn't come down on your house!"", while another described Mrs Wessels' husband as ""the Chuck Norris of lawn mowers!""  Mrs Wessels said her photo had already been shared 3,500 times in two days, and she had received 256 friend requests. She said Friday's tornado was moving east - away from the house, and was gone in less than five minutes.  It caused no injuries in the town, and only minor structural damage was reported.

"London attack: Tech firms fight back in extremism row Technology companies have defended their handling of extremist content following the London terror attack.  Prime Minister Theresa May called for areas of the internet to be closed because tech giants had provided a ""safe space"" for terrorist ideology. But Google said it had already spent hundreds of millions of pounds on tackling the problem.  Facebook and Twitter said they were working hard to rid their networks of terrorist activity and support.  Google, which owns Youtube, along with Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, and Twitter were among the tech companies already facing pressure to tackle extremist content.  That pressure intensified following Saturday night's attack, which killed seven people and injured 48. The so-called Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Speaking outside Downing Street on Sunday, Mrs May said: ""We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. ""Yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies... provide."" Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said tech companies needed to tackle extremist content, in a similar way to how they had removed indecent images of children.  ""We know it can be done and we know the internet companies want to do it,"" she told the BBC on Monday. Google said it had invested heavily to fight abuse on its platforms and was already working on an ""international forum to accelerate and strengthen our existing work in this area"". The firm added that it shared ""the government's commitment to ensuring terrorists do not have a voice online"". Facebook said: ""Using a combination of technology and human review, we work aggressively to remove terrorist content from our platform as soon as we become aware of it - and if we become aware of an emergency involving imminent harm to someone's safety, we notify law enforcement."" Meanwhile, Twitter said ""terrorist content has no place on"" its platform.  Home Secretary Amber Rudd said on Sunday that tech firms needed to take down extremist content and limit the amount of end-to-end encryption that terrorists can use. End-to-end encryption renders messages unreadable if they are intercepted, for example by criminals or law enforcement. Silicon Valley is both on the offensive and defensive.  Defensive in that they are protecting their reputations as companies that put in a lot of work to stamp out extremist content online, but offensive in making it clear they do not feel ""kneejerk"" regulation is the way to solve the issue. The tech industry is mostly in agreement on this. They believe that end-to-end encryption, while perhaps frustrating to police, is a technology that means everyone's communications are far more secure.  The logic put forward by experts is that if there's a way to break into a terrorist's smartphone without his permission - then there's a way to break into your smartphone too.  On Monday, Apple will be holding its annual developers' conference in San Jose. I'm not expecting chief executive Tim Cook to talk about the issue - he won't want to willingly draw his company into the debate - but you can fully expect Apple to put its weight behind any movement that seeks to increase security.  And the company will speak out, as it often has, against any attempts from authorities to compel tech firms to give them a so-called ""back door"" into their systems. The Open Rights Group, which campaigns for privacy and free speech online, warned that politicians risked pushing terrorists' ""vile networks"" into the ""darker corners of the web"" by more regulation. The way that supporters of jihadist groups use social media has changed ""despite what the prime minister says"", according to Dr Shiraz Maher of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King's College London. They have ""moved to more clandestine methods"", with encrypted messaging app Telegram the primary platform, Dr Maher told the BBC. Professor Peter Neumann, another director at the ICSR, wrote on Twitter: ""Blaming social media platforms is politically convenient but intellectually lazy."" However, Dr Julia Rushchenko, a London-based research fellow at the Henry Jackson Centre for the Response to Radicalisation and Terrorism, told the BBC that more could be done by tech giants to root out such content.    She felt that the companies erred on the side of privacy, not security. ""We all know that social media companies have been a very helpful tool for hate preachers and for extremists,"" Dr Rushchenko said. Investors suggested that tech firms would be more willing to take further action against extremist content if shareholders and advertisers pressured them to do so. Jessica Ground, a UK fund manager at Schroders, told the BBC: ""It's going to be an interesting debate how you put the pressure points. It could be the money rather than the governments."" Simon Howard, chief executive of UKSIF - the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, said: ""We'll need all the technology companies to do a bit more and we'll have to decide what the UK legal framework in which they do that is.""

"Philippines violence: Marawi civilians trapped as fire breaks truce Hundreds of civilians remain trapped in the besieged Philippine city of Marawi after gunfire disrupted a four-hour truce to evacuate them.  Officials had hoped that around 1,000 residents would leave the city but only some 130 were freed, reports said. The ceasefire between the army and militants allied to so-called Islamic State (IS) had been reached through intermediaries. The fighting has left more 170 dead, including at least 20 civilians. The ceasefire was expected to last until 12:00 local time (04:00 GMT). But one hour into it, gunfire broke out, apparently preventing residents from leaving the city, Reuters news agency reported. It was not clear who was firing. A government representative said negotiations were continuing for another temporary ceasefire on Monday. Most of the civilians have already fled Marawi but up to 2,000 are believed to be in the city. The truce had been mediated by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebel group, a separatist movement based on Mindanao island, where Marawi is located. They have signed accords with the government aimed at forging a final peace. The violence in Marawi began last month when the army failed in its attempt to capture Isnilon Hapilon, believed to be the main IS leader in the Philippines and linked to the local Maute group, who have declared allegiance to IS. In response the Maute group attacked parts of the city with a population of 200,000, taking hostages. President Rodrigo Duterte then declared martial law on Mindanao. The Philippine military, using armed forces and helicopter airstrikes, have retaken many areas, but others remain in rebel hands. The Philippines, which is majority Catholic, has faced Muslim separatist movements for decades in Mindanao with its significant Muslim population. Marawi is known as ""Islamic City"" in the Philippines for its Muslim-majority population.",Monday 05 June 2017,5-Jun-17,Gunfire halts truce in Philippine city,Hundreds of people are trapped in Marawi on Mindanao island as the army fights IS-linked militants.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40150570
"India v Pakistan: Virat Kohli leads his side to win in Champions Trophy By Tom Fordyce Chief sports writer at Edgbaston 
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         An unbeaten 81 from captain Virat Kohli helped steer India to a comprehensive 124-run victory over Pakistan in the opening match of their Champions Trophy campaign at Edgbaston. Kohli's big hitting - allied to a more patient 91 from opener Rohit Sharma and a blistering half-century from Yuvraj Singh - saw India post a daunting 319-3 from their rain-reduced 48 overs. Pakistan, chasing a DLS-revised target of 289 off 41 overs, lost wickets at regular intervals, with only Azhar Ali threatening a substantial score. The result leaves India level on points with South Africa at the top of Group B, with their second of three group matches against Sri Lanka on Thursday. Pakistan meet South Africa in Birmingham on Wednesday, their struggle to 164 all out underlining how much they will have to improve to make the semi-finals. It was a disappointingly, one-sided ending to a match which is regarded by many as the 'biggest in sport'. India now have seven successive wins against their rivals in ICC tournaments. With 10 overs of their innings to go, India were 202-2, becalmed by smart bowling and two rain delays in quick succession. But with Pakistan losing bowlers Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz to injury and two straightforward catches going down, the India dream team of Kohli and Yuvraj were able to pile on the runs in stirring fashion. Yuvraj, dropped badly on eight by Hasan Ali, accelerated to his half-century off just 29 balls, pulling one six from the top of off stump over deep mid-wicket and clubbing eight fours from the denuded attack. When he fell for 53, Kohli and Hardik Pandya took over, the India captain pulling Hasan over long-on for one six and then driving the same bowler over deep extra cover for six more. Kohli had been dropped himself on 43, but with a characteristic blend of power and panache went on to an unbeaten 81 garlanded by six fours and three sixes. A massive 89 runs came off the last 36 balls, 72 from the concluding four overs alone, Pandya hitting Imad Wasim for three consecutive sixes in the final over and Wahab hobbling off with figures of 0-87 off 8.4 overs, the most expensive in Champions Trophy history.

                         With all eight teams now having played one match, it is India who are unsurprisingly shaping up as the most potent threat to pre-tournament favourites England. With power-hitters throughout the team and a bowling attack that never allowed Pakistan a realistic chance, they seldom looked in trouble on the ground where they won the trophy four years ago. Ravindra Jadeja's left-arm spin accounted for Azhar on 50 and Mohammad Hafeez for 33, while his direct hit from backward point ran out Pakistan's other big hope Shoaib Malik for just 15. The accuracy of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and pace of Umesh Yadav had tied Pakistan down early, with the unorthodox Jasprit Bumrah also economical on a pitch that had offered little during India's innings. While their fielding was sometimes sloppy, the final margin was authoritative, a much-anticipated contest meandering to a close in the most one-sided fashion. India captain Virat Kohli: ""With bat and ball we were nine out of 10. In the field we were six today.  ""If we tune that up to eight or nine we will be a strong side, it was a very complete game for us."" Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed: ""It was in control in 40 overs but we lost the plot in the last eight overs. ""I think we will sit together and talk about how to control our bowling rate and also our batting as well."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special: ""A comfortable victory for India. It's a bit of a hiding, frankly. ""It's difficult to assess when games are changed around with rain breaks but that's a thumping win."" Analysis and opinion from the BBC's cricket correspondent.

"Turin stampede: '1,500 injured' at Juventus screening About 1,500 people were injured in the Italian city of Turin after a firecracker provoked a stampede on Saturday night, police say. Thousands of football fans were watching a live relay of Juventus' Champions League final against Real Madrid in Cardiff when a bang was heard and rumours of an explosion spread.  At least seven people, including a seven-year-old child, were seriously hurt, local media say. Real defeated Juventus 4-1. It is the 12th Champions League title for Real Madrid. With 10 minutes of the second half remaining, crowds rushed away from the centre of Piazza San Carlo, crushing people against barriers.  Bags and shoes were left scattered on the ground as people ran screaming out of the square. Some of the injuries occurred when a barrier around the entrance to an underground car park gave way. While most of the wounded had cuts on their legs and arms, seven were still in hospital, local media reported. Three of them were reportedly in a critical condition, including a seven-year-old boy who had head and chest injuries after he was trampled by people rushing to escape.

"Malta election: PM Joseph Muscat wins snap poll Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has won the snap general election he called a month ago amid corruption allegations concerning his wife.  The full results have yet to be announced. But Mr Muscat claimed victory based on projections and the opposition's Simon Busuttil conceded.  The Labour PM called the poll on 1 May saying the corruption allegations risked undermining the economy.  He and his wife deny claims she owned a secret offshore company in Panama. The issue of the company, alleged to have received payments from Azerbaijan's ruling family, was first brought to light by a well known Maltese blogger.  Projections based on preliminary results gave Mr Muscat's Labour Party a lead of 10%. More than 340,000 people were eligible to vote in Saturday's poll.  Opinion polls in the run-up to the vote had suggested a 5% lead for Mr Muscat, who is now set for a second five-year term in office.  The election was called a year before the end of his first term.  Mr Busuttil, leading the National Party into an election for the first time, said on Twitter that he respected the decision of the electorate.  Malta is enjoying growth of 6% and low unemployment - a performance that was central to Mr Muscat's campaign.  The prime minister, 43, said: ""The people have clearly chosen to stay on the road to even greater results"". Is Malta really Europe's 'pirate base' for tax? A judicial investigation is under way into the allegations of improper business transactions by his wife, Michelle, and associates.

"Global beer sales drying up, says report People are drinking fewer alcoholic drinks, according to a new industry report tracking consumption worldwide. Beer sales continued to slide last year and the trend towards cider sipping stalled. The global market for all alcoholic drinks contracted 1.3% in 2016, driven by a 1.8% fall in beer sales, the International Wine and Spirits Record (IWSR) found. Cider sales went in reverse, down 1.5% after several years of growth.  The overall contraction of international alcohol sales is far greater than the average dip of 0.3% in the previous five years. The IWSR market report for 2016 found global wine sales to be relatively flat, down 0.1% and spirits consumption grew 0.3%.

"Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid By Phil McNulty Chief football writer at the Principality Stadium Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid retained the Champions League in scintillating style by overwhelming Juventus in Cardiff. Real's record 12th triumph in this competition - and third in four seasons - was predictably orchestrated by Ronaldo, who has now scored in three different Champions League finals.  Ronaldo stopped a bright Juve opening in its tracks as he swept in Dani Carvajal's pass after 20 minutes, before Mario Mandzukic levelled with one of the great Champions League final goals, firing a sublime overhead kick beyond Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Real were unstoppable after the break, restoring their lead through Casemiro's deflected shot before Ronaldo scored at the near post from a cross by the outstanding Luka Modric. Juventus' misery increased when substitute Juan Cuadrado was sent off for a second caution after a clash with Sergio Ramos, before substitute Marco Asensio emphasised Real's superiority with a precise finish in the last minute. Real coach Zinedine Zidane has now won back-to-back Champions Leagues - as well as this season's La Liga title - since he took charge in January 2016. 
                            Media playback is not supported on this device
                         Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure early in the match, gesturing to German referee Felix Brych about what he perceived as some rough treatment. But he ended the night as Real's hero, winning his third Champions League winners' medal for the Spanish club and fourth in total, as the 32-year-old continues to write new chapters in his glittering career. On display in Cardiff were all the facets that make him an all-time great - pace, desire, anticipation, technique - as he helped Real dismantle a Juve defence that conceded just three goals in 1,080 minutes en route to the final. Ronaldo's first was an instant sweeping finish beyond the outstretched right arm of Gianluigi Buffon while the second showed the touch of a poacher, moving like lightning beyond static Juve defenders to guide in an emphatic near-post finish. The Portugal captain now has a remarkable record of 105 goals in 140 Champions League games - 12 of those coming in just 13 games this season. Big players define big matches and Ronaldo defines more than most.  He did so again here in Cardiff. Real had their qualities questioned in their most recent Champions League finals, starting with their victory over Atletico Madrid in Lisbon in 2014 - when they needed Ramos' injury-time equaliser to force extra time before going on to win - and again last season when they beat the same opponents on penalties. No such questions can be levelled at Real after this latest triumph. This was the performance of a world-class team, ripping apart a defence that has a reputation as one of football's meanest and did not concede a goal in either leg of their quarter-final win against Barcelona, keeping out Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. Real survived a whirlwind Juventus opening before taking control after the break, with Modric and Toni Kroos manipulating possession in midfield and Ronaldo providing the cutting edge. Juventus had performed with such distinction in this Champions League that many experts understandably had them as favourites - instead they ended heavily beaten by a ruthless and wonderfully gifted side. Juventus looked the complete package en route to this final. Not only did Massimiliano Allegri's side have that formidable defence but also a potent attack led by Gonzalo Higuain. They started as if determined to banish the demons that have visited them in past Champions League finals. They made a razor-sharp start - Miralem Pjanic's early 25-yard shot beaten away by Navas. Juve were right in the game after Mandzukic's triumph of technique and athleticism pulled them level - but they faded badly in the second half and ended overwhelmed. And most sympathy will go to Buffon, a three-time loser at 39 years and 126 days and whose expression at the conclusion suggested he knows another chance could be beyond him. The cruelty of the game was illustrated by the agony on his face as he reached in vain for Casemiro's long-range shot, which was deflected tantalisingly out of his reach off Sami Khedira's heel. Juve, though, can have no complaints and have now lost five Champions League finals since they last won the competition in 1996. Real Madrid will face Europa League winners Manchester United in the 2017 Uefa Super Cup (19:45 BST) in Skopje, Macedonia, on 8 August. Match ends, Juventus 1, Real Madrid 4.

"Two London attackers named by police Two of the three men who carried out Saturday night's terror attack in London have been named by police. They said Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, 27, of Barking, London, had been known to police and MI5 but there had not been any intelligence about an attack. The other attacker was Rachid Redouane, 30, from Barking, who police said had claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan. The attackers were shot dead by police. All 12 people arrested after the attack have now been released without charge. The seven women and five men were arrested in Barking on Sunday following the attack in which seven people were killed and 48 injured. The attackers drove a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in the area around Borough Market. A vigil was held at Potters Field Park near London Bridge on Monday evening to remember the victims. NHS England said 36 people remained in hospital, with 18 in a critical condition. Redouane, who was a chef, also used the name Rachid Elkhdar. He had not been known to police. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said: ""Inquiries are ongoing to confirm the identity of their accomplice."" He said the investigation into Butt had begun two years ago but ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly"".  He added: ""Work is ongoing to understand more about them, their connections and whether they were assisted or supported by anyone else."" Butt featured in a Channel 4 documentary last year about Islamist extremists with links to the jailed preacher Anjem Choudary.  The attacker, who had older siblings and was married with at least one child, could be seen in the programme arguing with police officers in the street. An online CV seen by the BBC shows that Butt had achieved an NVQ Level 2 in business administration. He went on to work in an administrative role for a company called Auriga Holdings, based in East Ham, which manages Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets.  He had also worked for London Underground for just under six months as a trainee customer services assistant, before leaving in October last year, Transport for London said. And Butt was the sole director of a now-dissolved company called Kool Kosmetics. The vigil began as a sombre and quiet gathering under the trees in Potters Field Park, where people stood in quiet contemplation looking out over the Thames.  So many spoke of their desire to stand together with others and show love.   London Mayor Sadiq Khan's speech roused the quiet crowd of thousands into hearty applause when he spoke of his disgust and defiance over the horror of Saturday's events. After a minute's silence, many went forward to lay flowers beneath the flagpoles of City Hall.  It was a dignified show of solidarity and strength in the face of fear and hate.  Read more here. BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said two people in Barking had raised concerns about Butt. One man called the anti-terrorism hotline in 2015, while a woman went to the local police station because she was scared Butt was trying to radicalise her children. Security officials made him a lower priority than other targets because of a lack of information that he was involved in attack-planning, our correspondent said. Sources in Dublin said Redouane was understood to have been carrying an identification card issued in the Republic of Ireland when he was shot dead, the Press Association reported. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said he was not a member of a ""small group"" being monitored by Irish police in respect of radicalisation. Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, 30, was the first victim to be named. Her family said she had died in her fiancé's arms after being struck by the attackers' speeding van. The sister of 32-year-old James McMullan, from Hackney, east London, said he was believed to be among those who died, after his bank card was found on a body at the scene. A French national was also killed in the attack, according to foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

"Trump renews feud with London mayor over terror attack US President Donald Trump has again lashed out at London Mayor Sadiq Khan over his assurances to Londoners following Saturday's terror attack. He accused Mr Khan of offering a ""pathetic excuse"" for saying there was no reason for people to be alarmed.  Mr Khan had in fact said people should not be alarmed by an increased police presence. After a vigil for the victims of the attack, Mr Khan said he would not allow Mr Trump to ""divide our communities"".  Seven people were killed and 48 others injured in the attack on Saturday. Mr Trump took issue with Mr Khan's statement in the aftermath of the attack, when the mayor said: ""Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed.""  The US president responded: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" He followed this up with another tweet on Monday, saying: ""Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM [mainstream media] is working hard to sell it!"" The mayor's spokesman earlier made clear that he was telling Londoners not to be worried about the increased presence of armed police officers in the city. Speaking to the BBC after the vigil, Mr Khan said: ""We've got to recognise that some people want to divide our communities, some people thrive on fuelling division.  ""That's not me, that's not the London  I know, and we aren't going to allow anybody, whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else to divide our community."" His spokesperson earlier said he ""has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context"" the mayor's remarks. Mr Trump's attacks on Mr Khan have drawn condemnation from both sides of the Atlantic. His critics have accused him of being insensitive and twisting the mayor's words. Politicians in the UK on Monday called on the prime minister to withdraw the invitation for Mr Trump's state visit later this year. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, said: ""This is a man insulting our national values at a time of introspection and mourning.""  Over the weekend, Prime Minister Theresa May refused to criticise Mr Trump, simply saying that Mr Khan was doing a ""good job"". British voters go to the polls on Thursday in a general election. ""Try to imagine the UK prime minister attacking the Mayor of NYC the day after 9/11,"" said European Parliament cabinet member Simon O'Connor. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was quick to defend Mr Khan, praising him for ""doing exactly the right thing"". ""I don't understand why Donald Trump is trying to undermine a man who's trying to protect the people of London. It makes no sense,"" Mr de Blasio told the BBC's Nick Bryant during a press conference in New York on Monday. Trump renews feud with mayor of London The US Conference of Mayors, representing more than 1,400 American cities, backed Mr Khan. ""He has risen above this crisis of death and destruction, as mayors continue to do, to alleviate fear, to bring comfort to his people of London,"" the mayors wrote in a statement on Sunday. Mr Khan, a Muslim, has previously criticised the president's plans to temporarily restrict travel to the US from six mainly Muslim countries. After Mr Trump as a presidential candidate announced his plan, Mr Khan told the BBC he hoped he would ""lose badly"", adding that he was a ""buffoon"". He also called Mr Trump's views on Islam ""ignorant"", leading the New York billionaire to challenge him to an IQ test. In the wake of the London attack, Mr Trump has been tweeting about his stalled travel ban. Federal courts struck down the first proposal in January. The administration replaced it with a less stringent version order in March, but that also ended up in limbo after legal defeats. On Monday, the president attacked the Justice Department for revising the original measure, leaving it ""watered down"" and ""politically correct"". The Trump administration is expected to take the proposal to the Supreme Court next week. He argues the measure is needed to prevent attacks in the US, but critics say the policy is discriminatory and has little national security justification.",Tuesday 06 June 2017,6-Jun-17,Trump renews feud with mayor of London,"Sadiq Khan hits back at Donald Trump, saying he won't allow the US president to divide communities.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40163567
"Sacked Florida employee shoots five ex-colleagues in head A disgruntled US employee walked back into the factory that fired him and fatally shot five ex-colleagues, before killing himself, police say. John Robert Neumann, 45, was armed with a semi-automatic handgun and hunting knife when he entered the business near Orlando, Florida, on Monday morning. The US army veteran was sacked in April, police say.  There is no suggestion he was a member of a subversive or terrorist organisation, they add. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the shooting had unfolded at the premises of Fiamma, which makes awnings for motor homes and camper vans. Most of the victims were shot in the head, some multiple times, he added. ""He was certainly singling out the individuals that he shot,"" said Sheriff Demings. The victims included Robert Snyder, 69, Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44, Kevin Clark, 53, Jeffrey Roberts, 57, and another unidentified man. Neumann reloaded his handgun at least once during the rampage, the sheriff said.  The gunman had told an employee whom he did not know to leave the premises, and left about seven other staff members uninjured.  Neumann - who lived alone in the area - killed himself as deputies were about to enter the warehouse, the sheriff said. Authorities say he did not have a permit for the weapon.  He was honourably discharged from the army in 1999. He had a history of misdemeanour criminal offences, such as possession of marijuana and driving under the influence. Neumann attacked a member of staff in 2014, though no charges were filed, police said. In a statement, Florida Governor Rick Scott condemned a ""senseless act of violence"". ""Over the past year, the Orlando community has been challenged like never before,"" he said.  The shooting came a week before the first anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting that left 49 people dead in Orlando.

"El Capitan climb: Alex Honnold basks in solo feat glory A climber who has become the first person to reach the top of California's El Capitan rock without a rope has described his intense satisfaction. ""It was exactly what I hoped for. I felt so good. It went pretty much perfectly,"" Alex Honnold said. His ascent of the 3,000ft (1,000m) rock-face in Yosemite National Park on Saturday has been described as one of the greatest solo climbing feats. It took Mr Honnold four hours to scale it without ropes or other safety gear. In places the 31-year-old Californian had to dangle from the mountain by his fingertips.  ""At the bottom I was slightly nervous,"" he told the National Geographic magazine. ""I was slightly tense, but felt really good."" ""I didn't have much of a backpack, and the climbing just felt amazing.  ""Not dragging 60 meters of rope behind you for the whole mountain, I felt so much more energetic and fresh."" Mr Honnold set off it was ""still quite dark"", disturbing a wild bear as made his way to the base of the rock's huge granite wall. He said the hardest part of the climb occurs about 700m (2,300ft) up, where there are only very small handholds. The climber has been ropeless climbing for about 20 years and had been preparing for the El Capitan ascent for more than 12 months - with time spent training in the US, China, Europe and Morocco.  Only a small group of people knew of his plans to make the ascent and they had promised to remain silent. ""Physically [the climb] is not that hard to execute,"" he said. ""It's more you have to be in exactly the right [mental] place, so I was trying to create the right place,"" he said. Experts say the climber's achievement is all the more impressive because it used to take weeks to reach the top even with the aid of a partner and climbing aids. But speed climbers have more recently made the ascent faster by working in tandem. In 2015 two climbers made it to the the top without aids, except for harnesses and ropes to prevent deadly falls. But it still took them more than two weeks.",Tuesday 06 June 2017,6-Jun-17,El Capitan climber savours solo feat,"Alex Honnold, the first person to climb the California rock without a rope, describes his joy.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40157137
"London attack victim Chrissy Archibald remembered for good deeds The Canadian woman killed in the London Bridge attacks is being remembered for her ""huge heart"" and ""kind spirit"".  Christine Archibald, 30, from Castlegar, British Columbia, was the first person to be named as killed in Saturday's attacks in London.  She is described as a kind-hearted person who cared deeply about her work with people struggling with addiction and homelessness.   Her family asked that people honour her memory by helping in their community.   ""Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter.  Tell them Chrissy sent you,"" the Archibald family said in a statement.  In response, people around the world are now using the hashtags #chrissysentme and #chrissysentyou on Twitter.  Alpha House Society, where Ms Archibald worked before relocating to Europe, said in a statement that her former colleagues are devastated by her death.  ""Chrissy was a bright light to many, and her generosity, kind spirit and huge heart for her work in responding to issues of addictions and homelessness at the centre inspired us all,"" the Calgary-based charity said.  ""We grieve the loss of our dear friend and colleague, and will remember her as a talented social worker, workmate and exceptional human being. It was our privilege to have known her.""  Calgary's Mount Royal University, where Ms Archibald studied social work, described her as ""a truly outstanding student"".  Ms Archibald and her fiance were in London when three attackers drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in the nearby Borough Market. The attackers were shot dead by police.  Seven people were killed in the terror attack and 48 people were injured, 18 critically.  Ms Archibald died in the arms of her fiance, Tyler Ferguson, on the bridge. Ms Archibald was born and raised in the Canadian province of British Columbia before moving to the city of Calgary, Alberta. She had most recently been living in Holland with Mr Ferguson. Mr Ferguson's sister, Cassie, wrote on Facebook: ""Hearing his painful sobs on the phone while he's alone trying to deal with this tears me apart."" His brother, Mark, said on Facebook that Ms Archibald was one of those struck by the van in the initial attack.  ""His life, and all those close to her have been changed forever,"" he wrote.  ""These senseless acts of terror need to stop! What does it accomplish other then wreck the lives of innocent people?""  Her family says they are grieving the loss of their ""beautiful, loving daughter and sister"".  The statement adds: ""She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected.  She lived this belief working in a shelter for the homeless until she moved to Europe to be with her fiance. She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death.""

"What Trump's latest Twitter tirade tells us The London Bridge attacks set Donald Trump off on an extended Twitter rant over the past few days, reviving his calls for sweeping immigration action and renewing old feuds with Democrats, gun-control advocates and even the mayor of London. While White House advisor Kellyanne Conway recently complained that the media have an ""obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president"", Mr Trump is the pot-stirrer-in-chief, who has the power to drive debate and shape events. Words, whether spoken or tweeted, have consequences. The president's Monday morning fusillade about his immigration policy is no exception. Here are five things we learned. The lynchpin of the White House's defence of Mr Trump's two controversial immigration executive orders that set restrictions on immigration from a handful of majority-Muslim nations was that they had no connection to the anti-Muslim travel ban candidate Trump proposed back in December 2015. The executive actions, they argued, constituted temporary restrictions and not a ""ban"", Muslim or otherwise. The president has occasionally undercut that defence, by using the b-word in the past - leaving his aides to clean up the mess.  ""It's not a Muslim ban. It's not a travel ban,"" Press Secretary Sean Spicer said back in January. ""It's a vetting system to keep America safe.""  On Monday morning, however, Mr Trump applied kerosene to that defence, set it ablaze and danced around its ashes. ""People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want,"" he tweeted, ""but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN."" Speaking of the judicial branch, the president on Monday morning went on the attack against the US legal system, calling the courts ""slow and political"". The line is reminiscent of one of the president's more inflammatory tweets, when he lashed out against the federal judge who struck down his original immigration order. ""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" he tweeted on 4 February. The following day he issued an even more ominous warning, tweeting that the judge put the nation in peril and ""if something bad happens blame him and the court system"". According to one theory, advanced by Lawfare blog's Jack Goldsmith, Mr Trump's seemingly ill-considered comments are all part of a plan to get the courts to strike down his immigration orders, freeing him to blame the judiciary for any subsequent attacks. It may, however, be just another case of ""what you see is what you get"" with Mr Trump. He has feuded with judges throughout his professional life, including criticising the Mexican heritage of the man who was presiding over a lawsuit against his for-profit ""university"" during last year's presidential campaign. President Trump is the same as candidate Trump is the same as businessman/TV star Trump. The stage may be different, but the man doesn't change. Trump turns on his own One of the more unusual components of Mr Trump's Monday morning diatribe was that he turned his Twitter invective on his own administration.  He lashed out at the Justice Department, headed by his close political confidant Jeff Sessions, for focusing its legal defence on what he called the ""watered down, politically correct"" second executive order on immigration and not the more sweeping first version that explicitly mentioned religion and caused confusion when it was first enforced at airport immigration checkpoints. Justice Department lawyers have tried to decouple the second order from the original, arguing that it remedied the discriminatory portions of the earlier effort, clarified that those with legal residency were unaffected and focused exclusively on nations that had previously been determined to be of concern to US. When the president signed that second order in early March, Spicer tweeted that it would ""keep the nation safe"". ""This revised order will bolster the security of the United States and our allies"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. Now the president is bad-mouthing the very same action his aides had resolutely defended. He is clearly irked that his administration abandoned that first travel order, particularly after he told its critics that he would see them ""in court"". If Mr Trump continues to casually undercut his own people, however, they'll be less willing to rush to his defence in the coming days - when the president may need them most.  Last week, for instance, multiple officials doggedly refused to say whether the president believes climate change is caused by human activity - a position most conservative officeholders, including the president's own Environmental Protection Agency head, accept. Such reluctance may be just a taste of things to come. Why go out on a limb for a president who is standing by the tree with a saw in hand? The president also dusted off one of his favourite terms from the 2016 campaign - ""extreme vetting"" - which he said is helping ""keep our country safe"". The original justification for the travel ban orders was that they were a temporary measure to allow a rigorous review process to be instituted for all individuals entering the US. The first action's time frame for implementation was 90 days - which would have set the mark at 27 April. The second order, signed on 6 March, reset the 90-day clock again - a point that was reached on Sunday.  The Weekly Standard's Michael Warren reached out to the Trump White House for further clarification on what vetting measures had been put in place and was directed to the State Department, which has not yet responded. Before Monday morning the last time the president himself had mentioned ""extreme vetting"" was in mid-February, when he said it ""will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places"".  Now extreme vetting - as a term at least - is back. But what is it? And if it's already in place, doesn't that erase the justification for implementing the travel ban? It might - unless, of course, the ban was never intended to be temporary. That's a question the ""slow and political"" courts are likely to consider. The president's social media onslaught comes after the latest round of stories about how the president was going to be more disciplined and focused, and less prone to Twitter tirades. Mr Trump's lawyers, we were told, were counselling him to tamp things down, lest his comments land him in more hot water. The president has apparently disregarded this advice yet again and is trying his best to fight old battles and rekindle old feuds.  Why? Perhaps it's because there is a very dark storm cloud on the horizon. On Thursday former FBI Director James Comey - the man Mr Trump dramatically fired and has since very publicly insulted - will testify under oath before a Senate inquiry into Russia's meddling in the US presidential election. He's expected to discuss reports that the president asked him to pledge his loyalty and pressured him to back off from his investigation of Trump foreign policy advisor Michael Flynn. Given Mr Comey's reputation for political independence and moral certitude - combined with the possibility that he has contemporaneous memos documenting his interactions with the president - the testimony could be disastrous for the White House. At the very least, it will be a spectacle the likes of which Washington has not seen in decades. The president could be eager to change the subject or, at the very least, deflect some attention. If so, the past few days of Twitter invective could be just the start.",Tuesday 06 June 2017,6-Jun-17,What Trump's latest Twitter tirade tells us,Donald Trump takes to Twitter to defend his immigration orders.

"Bill Cosby 'used power and fame to prey on woman' A witness in the Bill Cosby sex assault trial has told the court he drugged and sexually abused her in 1998. It is the same method he is said to have used in the alleged 2004 attack on Andrea Constand he is on trial for. Mr Cosby, 79, denies the charge. His lawyer says she agreed to sex and has changed her story to investigators. Dozens of women say Mr Cosby assaulted them, but statutes of limitation rules mean he is on trial for only one allegation. In both incidents Mr Cosby is said to have invited a young woman to his home for career advice before offering her a pill to ""relax"" her and abusing her once she was incapacitated. Witness Kelly Johnson said she initially hid the pill under her tongue but Mr Cosby then checked to see if she had swallowed it. She later woke up partially clothed in Mr Cosby's bed with Mr Cosby behind her, grunting, before he forced her to touch his genitals, she told the court. ""I was trying to say something,"" she said. ""I don't know if I was actually speaking."" The case is seen as the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. It revolved around ""trust, betrayal and the inability to consent"", prosecutors told the court in Pennsylvania. Prosecutor Kristen Feden told jurors that the defendant had ""used his power and his fame and his previously practised method of placing a young, trusting woman in an incapacitated state so he could sexually pleasure himself"". As Mr Cosby sat a few feet away, the prosecutor urged jurors to look beyond his father role on the hit 1984-1992 television sitcom The Cosby Show. That wholesome TV image would be ""shattered"", she said, accusing the entertainer of ""heinous crimes"". Defence lawyer Brian McMonagle countered that Mr Cosby was the victim of false accusations.  ""Today I get a chance, with your help, to right a wrong,"" he told jurors. ""I get a chance, with your help, to protect a man from the destruction of the rest of his life."" The courthouse, in Norristown, about 20 miles (32km) outside Mr Cosby's home city of Philadelphia, swarmed with reporters as the celebrity arrived, emerging slowly from the back seat of a black SUV. Inside court he reappeared, dressed in a navy suit and a striped tie, never turning towards the packed courtroom behind him. He sat stoically, facing forward and periodically leaning over to confer with one of his lawyers. At one point he spoke out to no-one in particular, as one of his associates had walked away, possibly revealing an issue with poor sight. But as members of the jury entered, Mr Cosby - like everyone else in the room - turned his attention to their corner. Judge Steven O'Neill appealed to the courtroom full of reporters to ""let the trial play out"", before spending the first hour explaining to jurors their job. Ms Constand says Mr Cosby drugged and molested her after she visited his home seeking career advice in 2004. She was 31 at the time and had befriended him through Temple University in Philadelphia, where he served on the board of trustees. Ms Constand said Mr Cosby gave her three blue pills which made her legs feel ""like jelly"" and began to grope her. In 2006, the comedian settled with Ms Constand after providing an undisclosed cash sum to her. Mr Cosby's defence lawyers argued on Monday that his encounter with her was one of many consensual, romantic episodes between them. His legal team said he had only offered Ms Constand Quaaludes - a sedative widely used recreationally in the US in the 1970s - after she complained of having trouble sleeping. Mr Cosby's lawyers asked why Ms Constand had returned to his house after she said he had made previous unwanted sexual advances on her. They also presented evidence that the two had more than 70 phone discussions after the alleged incident, and accused Ms Constand of changing her story to police at least three times. Mr Cosby's wife of 53 years was not seen with him as he entered the court in Norristown, near Philadelphia, on Monday. But Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played his on-screen daughter in The Cosby Show, did accompany him.  Mr Cosby faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 (£19,500). The comic - who was at one point the highest-paid actor in the US - has said he will not testify in the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks. He has speculated that some of the allegations against him could be motivated by racism. The jury has seven men and five women - two are black and 10 white. If convicted, Mr Cosby faces up to a decade in prison.",Tuesday 06 June 2017,6-Jun-17,Bill Cosby 'used fame to prey on woman',A Pennsylvania court will hear allegations that the US comedian molested a college employee.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40156589
"Canada tornado: Alberta lawn-mowing man defies twister A picture of a man in Canada calmly mowing his lawn with a menacing tornado swirling in the background has gone viral on social media. Theunis Wessels was ""fully aware"" of the twister but ""wasn't worried at all"", his wife Cecilia, who took the photo, told the BBC. She said the tornado was about 2km (1.25 miles) from their house in Three Hills, Alberta - much further away than it appeared in the photo. The storm was quickly gone, she added. Mrs Wessels told the BBC she was sleeping in the house on Friday - but then was woken by her nine-year-old daughter who was concerned that her father would not abandon his lawn-mowing and hide inside from the tornado. ""My daughter was the most upset, saying 'Mum, what we gonna do?'"" Mrs Wessels came outside to check on her husband, who continued mowing. He said ""Everything is OK,"" and he looked ""calm, in control,"" she recollected. She added that he had some knowledge about twisters as he had recently attended a seminar organised by a storm-chasing association. Many town residents were taking pictures of the tornado, and Mrs Wessels decided to post hers on Facebook and also sent them to her mother in South Africa.  She said her mother was very worried about her son-in-law, asking: ""Why are you letting him outside? Please stay safe."" Very soon the picture began causing a storm on the social media.  One user wrote: ""This is the craziest picture! Lol. I'm glad that the tornado didn't come down on your house!"", while another described Mrs Wessels' husband as ""the Chuck Norris of lawn mowers!""  Mrs Wessels said her photo had already been shared 3,500 times in two days, and she had received 256 friend requests. She said Friday's tornado was moving east - away from the house, and was gone in less than five minutes.  It caused no injuries in the town, and only minor structural damage was reported.  Local authorities only issued a tornado warning after she had posted her pictures, Mrs Wessels said.",Tuesday 06 June 2017,6-Jun-17,Lawn-mowing Alberta man defies tornado,A photo of an Alberta man calmly cutting his lawn in extreme weather causes a storm on social media.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40155229
"Qatari planes banned from Egyptian and Saudi air space Qatari planes are to be banned from Egyptian and Saudi air space, as a growing diplomatic row in the Gulf threatens large-scale air disruption. Several countries have cut ties with the tiny Gulf state over accusations of supporting extremism in the region. Air, land and sea links have been halted to the country from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. Qatar denies backing militants, including so-called Islamic State (IS), and said the move was ""unjustified"". Sudan's foreign ministry offered to mediate between all sides ""in order to achieve calm and reconciliation"". This major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies, comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran.  Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE co-ordinated together to set the diplomatic withdrawal into motion, closing all transport ties by air, land and sea to Qatar, a tiny gas-rich peninsula.  They have given all Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their territory. The three countries have also banned their citizens from travelling to Qatar. The UAE and Egypt have given Qatari diplomats 48 hours to leave both countries. Saudi Arabia took it one step further by closing down a local office of Qatar's influential Al Jazeera TV channel. However, the country says it will still allow Qataris to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.  Egypt, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives later followed suit in severing diplomatic ties. Saudi Arabia's civil aviation authorities have banned Qatari planes from landing or stopping at its airports, as well as crossing Saudi airspace. Egypt has also closed off its airspace to flights originating from Qatar, and said all flights between the two countries would be halted from 04:00 GMT on Tuesday and ""continue until further notice"". Airlines from many of the affected countries, including Bahrain's Gulf Air, Etihad Airways and Emirates, say they plan to cancel flights to and from the Qatari capital Doha starting from Tuesday morning. Budget carriers, such as Fly Dubai and Air Arabia, have also cancelled routes to Doha.  The national airline, Qatar Airways, meanwhile has suspended its flights to Saudi Arabia. The BBC's Simon Atkinson says the suspension of flights may cause a major problem for the airline, forcing it to alter flight paths and inevitably add time to some flights.  There are reports of residents stockpiling food and water, as Qatar is heavily dependent on Saudi Arabia for its food imports. About 40% of Qatar's food is believed to come by lorry from its Gulf neighbour. An official with Iran's Union of Exporters of Agricultural Products was quoted by Fars news agency as saying Tehran could export food to Qatar by sea within 12 hours. While the severing of ties was sudden, it has not come out of the blue, as tensions have been building for years, and particularly in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE blocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. Comments purportedly by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticising Saudi Arabia had appeared on Qatari state media. The government in Doha dismissed the comments as fake, attributing the report to a ""shameful cybercrime"". Back in 2014, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar for several months in protest over alleged interference in their affairs. More broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and the role of Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. While Qatar has joined the US coalition against IS, the Qatari government has repeatedly denied accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. Wealthy individuals in the country are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hard line Islamist groups in Syria. Qatar is also accused of having links to a group formerly known as the Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate. The SPA statement accused Qatar of backing these groups, as well as the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood - banned in Gulf countries as a terrorist organisation - and that it ""promotes the message and schemes of these groups through their media constantly"". Saudi Arabia itself is a key backer of Islamist rebels, including hard line jihadist groups, in Syria, and has even been accused of funding IS. Is Saudi to blame for IS?

Experts say this may have emboldened Gulf states to take action, knowing that they had the backing of the Trump administration. Qatar, which is due to host the football World Cup in 2022, was critical of the decision. The foreign ministry said the decisions would ""not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents"". Iran, Turkey and the US have called on all sides to resolve their differences, with US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, pressing for dialogue. The White House said President Trump was committed to de-escalating tensions in the region.  Sudan's foreign ministry said the country was ""fully ready to undertake all efforts in order to achieve calm and reconciliation that would help serve the interests of the people of the region"". ""Sudan calls on the region's leaders to work together to overcome this dispute,"" it said. Qatar has hosted successive rounds of peace talks between the Sudanese government and rebels from Darfur.

"Ghost Ship fire: Two arrested over deadly Oakland blaze Two people have been arrested over a warehouse fire last year in Oakland, California, that left 36 people dead. Derick Almena and Max Harris are facing multiple counts of involuntary manslaughter. Mr Almena was leaseholder at the warehouse, a bohemian collective and living space for about 20 people, and Mr Harris was his deputy. The 2 December 2016 fire broke out during an illegal rave at the venue, known as the Ghost Ship. Investigators have not determined the exact cause of the blaze, which was the deadliest in the US for more than 10 years, though local media reports have cited a faulty electrical system as a possible cause. Oakland fire victims remembered A mother's quest to find missing daughter All the victims - who ranged in age from 17 to 61 - died of smoke inhalation as they struggled to flee down a makeshift staircase made from wooden pallets, investigators say. Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley announced criminal charges at a press conference on Monday. ""Defendants Almena and Harris knowingly created a fire trap with inadequate means of escape,"" she said. ""They then filled that area with human beings and are now facing the consequences of their actions."" ""They acting knowingly and disregarded the risk"" by allowing people to live in the building and by lying to police about how the space was being used, Mrs O'Malley added. Mr Almena held the lease for the Ghost Ship, collected rent from sub-tenants and decided who could live or work at the collective. Harris, who considered himself ""creative director"", helped collect rent while mediating disputes among tenants and with the building's owners, say prosecutors. If convicted the two face up to 39 years in prison. Mr Almena found himself the target of widespread criticism for a social media post after the tragedy when he lamented that ""everything I worked so hard for is gone"".

"Bob Dylan finally delivers his Nobel lecture Bob Dylan has finally delivered the lecture he needed to give in order to keep the prize money for his Nobel Prize for literature. The veteran star won the 8m krona ($900,000, £727,000) prize in October but did not collect the award until the end of March at a private event. And it has taken him until now to issue his taped lecture, which cites Buddy Holly as an influence. Dylan had until 10 June to deliver the lecture or forfeit the prize money. The singer mentioned three influential books - Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Homer's The Odyssey and Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front - in his lecture.  It has been posted on the Nobel website. ""The speech is extraordinary and, as one might expect, eloquent. Now that the lecture has been delivered, the Dylan adventure is coming to a close,"" Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, wrote in a blog post. Dylan said: ""If I was to go back to the dawning of it all, I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly... He was the archetype. Everything I wasn't and wanted to be."" Dylan said he ""had to travel a hundred miles to get to see him play"" and ""wasn't disappointed"".  Describing the encounter, he said Holly ""was powerful and electrifying and had a commanding presence"".  ""Out of the blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didn't know what. And it gave me the chills. ""It was a day or two after that that his plane went down… somebody handed me a Lead Belly record with the song Cottonfields on it. And that record changed my life right then and there."" This led him on to other artists, including Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers and Jean Ritchie. ""By listening to all the early folk artists and singing the songs yourself, you pick up the vernacular. You internalise it."" He then went on to talk about his literary influences.  ""Specific books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school - I want to tell you about three of them: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey."" He described Moby Dick as ""a fascinating book, a book that's filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue"". ""All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror story. This is a book where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern for individuals. ""The Odyssey is a great book whose themes have worked its way into the ballads of a lot of songwriters: Homeward Bound, Green, Green Grass of Home, Home on the Range, and my songs as well,"" he said. Dylan also spoke about the meaning in songs.  ""If a song moves you, that's all that's important. I don't have to know what a song means. I've written all kinds of things into my songs. And I'm not going to worry about it - what it all means. "" He concluded: ""Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page.  ""And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, 'Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story.'"" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Putin plays down ties with President Trump's ex-adviser Flynn Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he barely spoke to former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn at a dinner in Moscow in 2015. A widely-posted photo of the event has fuelled speculation about possible links between US President Donald Trump's administration and the Kremlin. But Mr Putin told NBC he was only told afterwards who Mr Flynn was.   Mr Flynn was sacked in February after misleading the White House about his ties with Russia's envoy to the US. Mr Flynn later invoked his right against self-incrimination, declining to testify in the US Senate Intelligence Committee about his Russian ties and alleged Moscow meddling in America's 2016 presidential elections.  President Trump denies any collusion with Russia, describing an ongoing FBI investigation a ""witch hunt"" against him. In December 2015, President Putin and Mr Flynn attended the gala dinner in honour of Russia's RT television network. But during the interview broadcast by NBC News' Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, the Russian leader played down his contacts with the American general. ""I made my speech, then I talked about some other stuff, then I got up and left,"" Mr Putin said.  ""And then afterwards I was told 'Do you know that was an American gentleman and he was involved in some things? He used to be in the security services.' That's it. I didn't even really talk to him."" He also rejected as ""another load of nonsense"" claims that the Kremlin had any damaging information on President Trump.",Tuesday 06 June 2017,6-Jun-17,Putin plays down ties with Flynn,Russia's leader says he barely spoke to the former US national security adviser at a dinner in 2015.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40155230
"'Pink slime': Meat processer seeks $5.7bn in defamation case A trial has begun in South Dakota over a meat processer's claim that it was defamed by ABC News reporting that dubbed its product ""pink slime"". Beef Products Inc (BPI) argues ABC and its journalist ruined its reputation in 2012 reports on ""lean finely textured beef"", as the industry calls it. BPI says ABC's ""disinformation campaign"" caused the meat processer's revenues to drop by 80%. They are suing ABC for up to $5.7bn (£4.4bn) in damages. During a hearing in January, a lawyer for BPI told the judge that ABC had engaged in ""fake news"".  In the reporting by ABC's Jim Avila, the term ""pink slime"" was used 137 times, as he described the process which creates it. Could 'pink slime' be rebranded? The beef trimmings are placed in a centrifuge in order to separate the lean meat from fat, before it is treated with ammonia to remove bacteria. The term ""pink slime"" was coined by Gerald Zirnstein, a former Agriculture Department scientist, who initially used it in an email to colleagues in 2002. Grocery stores across America dropped products containing ""pink slime"" after the ABC reports aired. The processed trimmings were also once found in fast-food served by McDonald's, Taco Bell and Burger King. BPI, which primarily produces the beef trimmings, shut down three of its four production plants following the reports. ABC lawyers argue they are protected under the US constitution's first amendment, which ensures a free press. The television network, which is owned by Walt Disney Company, argues that BPI must prove ABC's reporters acted with ""actual malice"" to harm the company. ""We believe in the principle that people deserve to know what's in the food they eat and are confident that when all the facts are presented in court, ABC's reporting will be fully vindicated,"" said Kevin Baine, a lawyer representing ABC. The trial in the rural town of Elk Point, population 2,000, just north of BPI's headquarters, is expected to last eight weeks.",Tuesday 06 June 2017,6-Jun-17,'Pink slime' defamation case seeks $5.7bn,A South Dakota meat processing plant claims ABC News ruined its reputation with its 2012 reports.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40167818
"Qatar row: Trump urges Arab unity in call to Saudi Arabia's King Salman US President Donald Trump has called the king of Saudi Arabia to urge Gulf unity amid an escalating dispute over Qatar's alleged support for militants. Earlier, he said the Saudis' move to isolate Qatar could mark the ""beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". Several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar on Monday. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism. The rift has affected oil prices, travel and shipping, and has raised fears of food shortages.  The emir of Kuwait is mediating in the dispute and the president of Turkey has also offered to help, saying isolation and sanctions will not resolve the crisis. ""His [Mr Trump's] message was that we need unity in the region to fight extremist ideology and terrorist financing,"" a US official told Reuters news agency. Mr Trump had earlier claimed credit for the pressure placed on Qatar, saying his recent visit to Saudi Arabia was ""already paying off"". In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump accused Qatar of funding terrorism, saying: ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" In his phone call to King Salman, he was quoted by Reuters as saying: ""It's important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region,""  Separately, the Pentagon thanked Qatar for hosting the largest US air force base in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister called on Qatar to cut ties with Palestinian group Hamas in the occupied territories, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, if it wanted to end its isolation in the Gulf region. Adel Al-Jubeir said: ""Nobody wants to hurt Qatar. It has to choose whether it must move in one direction or another direction."" Speaking in Paris, he said the economic measures should put pressure on Qatar to act ""like a normal country"". He name-checked ""support of extremist groups"", ""hostile media"" and ""interference in affairs of other countries"" as things Qatar would have to change if it wished to restore ties. He added that Qatar was undermining the Palestinian Authority and Egypt by supporting Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and said stopping these policies would ""contribute to stability in the Middle East"". Hamas is the largest of several militant Islamist Palestinian groups, and was the first Islamist group in the Arab world to win election at the ballot box, before it took power in Gaza after a battle 10 years ago. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is another Islamist group that became politically active. Some countries designate both as terrorist groups. The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington says Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have all funded extremists in Syria but pulled back under US pressure, while Qatar, which likes to see itself as a neutral player and potential intermediary, has dealings that are arguably murkier than the others'. But Qatar's Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Than, said: ""There is no single evidence that the Qatar government is supporting radical Islamists."" On Monday, several countries withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, Qatar's capital, while some cut transport links and gave Qatari nationals two weeks to leave their territory. Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. Airlines affected include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have revoked the licences of Qatar Airways and ordered its offices to close. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times. Qatar is heavily dependent on food imports and residents have been queuing at supermarkets to stockpile. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said isolating Qatar would ""not resolve any problems"" and called for ""mutual dialogue"". ""In this respect, we appreciate Qatar's constructive stance,"" he said. ""Trying to isolate Qatar, which certainly carries out an efficient fight against terrorism, will not resolve any problems.""

"Theresa May: Human rights laws could change for terror fight Theresa May says she will change human rights laws if they ""get in the way"" of tackling terror suspects.  She said she wants to do more to restrict the freedom of those posing a threat and to deport foreign suspects. The UK could seek opt-outs from the European Convention on Human Rights, which it has abided by since 1953. Labour said the UK would not defeat terrorism ""by ripping up basic rights"". The Lib Dems said it was a ""cynical"" move ahead of Thursday's election.  The Conservatives have faced criticism over police cuts and questions about intelligence failures following the terror attacks in London and Manchester. Speaking after Saturday's London attack, Mrs May said ""enough is enough"" and that ""things need to change"" in the terror fight. Addressing activists in Slough on Tuesday evening, she did not make any specific new policy proposals but said she envisaged longer prison sentences for those convicted of terrorist offences and making it easier for the authorities to deport foreign terrorist suspects back to their own countries. She added: ""And I mean doing more to restrict the freedom and movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they are a threat, but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court. ""And if our human rights laws get in the way of doing it, we will change the law so we can do it."" As a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK is permitted under Article 15 to ""derogate"", or depart from, parts of the Convention in limited circumstances.   This can only happen in ""time of emergency"", ie there must be a war or other public emergency ""threatening the life of the nation"".  If that is the case, the UK can take measures derogating from its obligations, but only to the extent strictly required by the situation. Any measures must not breach the UK's other obligations under international law. The government must keep the secretary general of the Council of Europe fully informed of the measures and its reasons for imposing them.  Derogation can be challenged in domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  The UK derogated from Article 5 of the ECHR - the right to liberty and security - during the troubles in Northern Ireland.   In 1979, the European Court of Human Rights found the circumstances of Northern Ireland and the use of preventative detention of terrorist suspects without trial met the criteria for derogation. In an interview with The Sun, Mrs May said she would also consider extending the time suspects could be held without charge to 28 days. The limit was reduced to 14 days in 2011 under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government. Mrs May was home secretary at the time. ""We said there may be circumstances where it is necessary to do this,"" she told the newspaper. ""I will listen to what they [the police and security services] think is necessary for us to do."" The Conservative manifesto committed the party to remaining in the European Convention on Human Rights - which is separate to the EU and which the UK helped to establish after World War Two - for the whole of the next Parliament.  Conservative sources say they would not withdraw from the ECHR but would seek temporary opt-outs called ""derogations"" from certain aspects.  This could possibly include Article 5 - which guarantees individuals' rights to liberty and security and the right to a trial ""within a reasonable time"", while protecting against unlawful arrest and detention.  During last year's Conservative leadership campaign, Mrs May said she personally backed leaving the ECHR, saying it made it harder to deport terror suspects and criminals. But she later said she did not believe there was enough support in Parliament for the move. The Conservatives have said they will reconsider the UK's human rights legal framework after leaving the EU but that the 1998 Human Rights Act will remain in place until that time. The party has long proposed replacing it will a British Bill of Rights. Sir Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions who is now Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, told Today the Human Rights Act ""had not got ""in the way of what we were doing"" during his many years prosecuting serious crime.  He warned against ""throwing away the very values that are at the heart of our democracy and everything we believe in"". Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said laws were already in place to deal with people, including foreign nationals, who presented a threat and that the government must always act ""within the law"".  What is the European Convention of Human Rights? Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the PM was making a ""very cynical"" attempt to appeal to UKIP voters, telling the BBC ""attacking the principles of human rights legislation is not the right way to keep us safe"". He denounced the ""explosive claim, free from any evidence, that the problem lies with human rights legislation"", saying the prime minister had a ""track record"" of making ""ludicrous"" claims about the impact of the laws.  He said ministers' focus should be on the fact one of the London Bridge attackers had been on a Italian terror watchlist  - and whether this information was properly shared and acted upon. Linking Brexit to security, he added: ""I think we need to enhance our use of those EU-wide databases which are proving to be the most sophisticated pool of information about would-be criminals."" ""It would be illegal for 27 other countries in the European Union to share data with us if we in the future, under Theresa May's plans, rule out abiding by European Union data protection rules."" UKIP has already backed extending pre-charge detention to 28 days. Their immigration spokesman Jon Bickley said the UK had to ""stop being so tolerant of other people's intolerance"".

"Woman on trial for texts 'driving boyfriend to suicide' A 20-year-old US woman, whose boyfriend took his own life nearly three years ago, has gone on trial for allegedly urging him to kill himself. Michelle Carter is charged with involuntary manslaughter for her role in the suicide of Conrad Roy III. Prosecutors allege Ms Carter drove the Massachusetts 18-year-old to his death to attract sympathy. She has asked a judge to rule on the case, rather than a jury of her peers. ""You need to do it, Conrad,"" Ms Carter texted him on the morning of 12 July, according to records presented by the Bristol County District Attorney's Office. ""You're ready and prepared. All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy,"" she wrote. She told him in another message: ""You're finally going to be happy in heaven. No more pain. It's okay to be scared and it's normal. I mean, you're about to die."" As he expressed doubts, she kept pushing. ""I thought you wanted to do this. The time is right and you're ready …  just do it babe,"" she said. ""No more pushing it off. No more waiting,"" she went on. Mr Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his vehicle at a Kmart car park in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, on 13 July 2014. Texts show he wavered in his plan to follow through with the suicide, at one point getting out of his pick-up truck. The court heard that Ms Carter, who was then 17, replied: ""Get the f*** back in the car."" After his death, she fundraised for mental health awareness and led a charity softball event in his honour. Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, told the court on Tuesday she had no warning of her son's suicide. She said: ""I thought he was a little depressed."" On the day of his death, Mr Roy went to the seaside in Westport, Massachusetts, with his mother and sisters, according to prosecutors. He bought his sisters ice cream, joked about bathing suits and spoke of a scholarship he had just won, while making other plans for the future. Ms Carter sent texts to Mrs Roy after her son's death, telling her that his spirit lived on. One text read: ""I loved him, Lynn. I know I'm young, but I saw the rest of my life with him."" As arguments began on Tuesday, images of his text exchanges with Ms Carter were broadcast on the courtroom wall. ""She used Conrad as a pawn,"" said Assistant District Attorney Maryclare Flynn, adding that the accused had wanted to gain attention as the ""grieving girlfriend"". ""She talked him out of his doubts point-by-point, assured him that his family would understand why he did it, researched logistics and reassured him that he was likely to succeed, and pushed him to stop procrastinating and get on with it, mocking his hesitation,"" said the prosecutor. Lawyers had requested the case be dismissed on the grounds of right to free speech. But a juvenile court judge ruled that encouraging suicide was not protected under the US constitution. Defence lawyer Joseph Cataldo argued that Mr Roy had been motivated to kill himself for some time, and that his depression was spurred by family troubles. He told the court that Ms Carter had previously talked her boyfriend out of suicide attempts. Recently unsealed documents show Mr Roy attempted to take his own life several times before, and had spent time researching methods online. Defence lawyer Mr Cataldo said in court: ""My heart goes out to the family, but this was a young man who planned this for months and months"". According to local media reports, Ms Carter had also texted Mr Roy that his parents would ""get over"" his suicide. ""You've hit that point and I think your parents know you've hit that point,"" the accused texted. ""You said your mom saw a suicide thing on your computer and she didn't say anything. I think she knows it's on your mind and she's prepared for it."" She added: ""They will always carry you in their hearts."" Mr Roy replied: ""Aww. Thank you, Michelle.""

"Cosby trial: Andrea Constand 'frozen in sex attack' The woman at the centre of Bill Cosby's sex assault trial testified she was ""frozen"" after the US comedian drugged and molested her at his home in 2004.  Andrea Constand, 44, shared her account publicly for the first time on the second day of Mr Cosby's trial. ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen"", she said.  She said Mr Cosby gave her pills he claimed were herbal to help her relieve stress over a possible career change. ""They're your friends,"" she recalled him saying when he handed her the pills. ""They'll take the edge off."" Mr Cosby, 79, denies the charge while his lawyers claim she agreed to sex and has changed her story several times.  But Ms Constand said her vision started to blur about 20 minutes after taking the pills. Mr Cosby began groping her and placing her hand on his genitals, she said. ""I wasn't able to fight it in any way,"" she told the court. ""I wanted it to stop."" She continued that she felt ""humiliated"" and ""confused"" after the alleged incident.  Before Tuesday's testimony, Ms Constand had been barred from sharing her story in public due to a confidential settlement she reached with Mr Cosby in 2006.  She received an undisclosed cash sum and her deposition from that lawsuit remains sealed.  Dozens of women say Mr Cosby assaulted them, but statutes of limitation rules mean he is on trial for only one allegation. A mother of a witness who separately claimed Mr Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in a similar manner in 1996 also testified on Tuesday in Norristown, a suburb of Philadelphia, where the trial is being held.  ""She changed considerably,"" Patricia Sewell said in court. ""Her circle of friends became small. She had very little social life. Her self-esteem was very damaged."" Kelly Johnson, Ms Sewell's daughter, testified on Monday that he gave her a pill to ""relax"" during a meeting at his Los Angeles hotel room for career advice.  Ms Johnson, who worked for a talent agency representing Mr Cosby, alleges she woke up partially clothed in the comedian's bed with him behind her, grunting, before he forced her to touch his genitals.  Angela Agrusa, an attorney for Mr Cosby, grilled Ms Sewell on her account of the alleged incident, suggesting she may have heard the story during a television appearance in 2015 instead of 1996 after it allegedly occurred.  The case is seen as the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. Ms Constand says Mr Cosby drugged and molested her after she visited his home seeking career advice in 2004. She was 31 at the time and had befriended him through Temple University in Philadelphia, where he served on the board of trustees. Mr Cosby's defence lawyers argued on Monday that his encounter with her was one of many consensual, romantic episodes between them. His legal team said he had only offered Ms Constand Quaaludes - a sedative widely used recreationally in the US in the 1970s - after she complained of having trouble sleeping. She is expected to serve as a key witness for prosecutors during the two-week trial.  Mr Cosby's wife of 53 years was not seen with him as he entered the court in Norristown, near Philadelphia, on Monday or Tuesday.  But Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played his on-screen daughter in The Cosby Show, did accompany him on the first day. Mr Cosby faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 (£19,500). The comic - who was at one point the highest-paid actor in the US - has said he will not testify in the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks. If convicted, Mr Cosby faces up to a decade in prison.",Wednesday 07 June 2017,7-Jun-17,Cosby accuser 'frozen in sex attack',Bill Cosby's accuser takes the stand and says she felt paralyzed as he sexually assaulted her.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40181195
"Being married 'protects your health' Marriage appears to be good for your health, boosting your survival chances if you have a major heart risk factor such as high cholesterol, say researchers. A loving spouse might spur you on to look after yourself better, they told a heart conference, based on their study of nearly a million UK adults. All of these people had high blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes. The married ones fared much better than those who were single.  Dr Paul Carter and colleagues at Aston Medical School, who carried out the work, have already shown that marriage is linked to a better chance of surviving a heart attack.  Their latest research, presented at the British Cardiovascular Society conference, hints at why this might be.  They suspect marriage helps buffer against big heart disease risk factors, including cholesterol and high blood pressure.  The study looked at deaths from all causes, including heart disease. Men and women in their 50s, 60s and 70s with high cholesterol were 16% more likely to be alive at the end of the 14-year ACALM study if they were married rather than single.  The same was true for diabetes and high blood pressure, with married people having a survival advantage. The picture was less clear for people cohabiting, separated, divorced or widowed.  Also, the researchers did not test if the wedded people were in happy marriages.  They suspect having someone special in your life is what's important, rather than simply getting hitched. Dr Carter said: ""We need to unpick the underlying reasons a bit more, but it appears there's something about being married that is protective, not only in patients with heart disease but also those with heart disease risk factors. ""We're not saying that everyone should get married though. ""We need to replicate the positive effects of marriage and use friends, family and social support networks in the same way."" Dr Mike Knapton, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ""The take-home message is that our social interactions, as well as medical risk factors such as high blood pressure, are important determinants of both our health and wellbeing. ""Whether you are married or not, if you have any of the main risk factors for heart disease, then you can call upon loved ones to help you to manage them.""

"Uber fires 20 staff after harassment investigation Uber has fired more than 20 people, and is taking other actions against staff, after a harassment investigation. The taxi-app firm said the sackings related to sexual harassment, bullying and issues about poor company culture. Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars.  Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leading him to say that he needed ""leadership help"". Susan Fowler, who wrote the critical blog post about Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations.  Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said.  Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture.  The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week.  Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally.  About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings.  Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal.  Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point.  So as well as detailing what it has done to address those existing complaints, Uber will now have to be very clear about how it will handle such issues in future. Crucially, the lessons from this report should not be heeded by Uber alone. As many people have pointed out to me since we began reporting this story, this is a problem that affects the technology industry across the board.

"Study casts doubt on the idea of 'big fluffy T. rex' Despite its ancestors having feathers, Tyrannosaurus rex most likely had scaly skin, according to fossil evidence.  Researchers say the huge predator had scales much like modern reptiles rather than feathers or fluff. The dinosaur may have ditched its feathers because it no longer needed insulation when it reached gigantic proportions, they propose. But the findings are unlikely to end the long-running debate about the physical appearance of T. rex. We don't need to throw out the image of a big fluffy T. rex quite yet, argued one palaeontologist. Whether T.rex was clad in scales, feathers or both, has long been a mystery, largely due to a lack of fossil evidence. Primitive feathers have been identified in some members of the Tyrannosaur group, leading to speculation that the king of reptiles also sported feathers. In the latest twist, researchers analysed skin impressions from a T.rex skeleton known as Wyrex, unearthed in Montana. They also looked at relatives that roamed during the Late Cretaceous in Asia and other parts of North America, including Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus. Skin patches from the neck, pelvis and tail of Wyrex show scaly, reptilian-like skin, says a team led by Dr Phil Bell of the University of New England, Australia. Writing in the journal, Biology Letters, they say fossil integument (outer covering) from T.rex and other members of the group confirm that ""these large-bodied forms possessed scaly reptilian-like skin.' The researchers think the giant tyrannosaurs lost their feathers over time because they no longer needed them as insulation.  But not all researchers are convinced. Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh said he wouldn't be surprised if T. rex lost or reduced its feathers, as it was a very big animal, just like elephants reduce their hair.  Asian elephants are hairier than African elephants because they are smaller and live in dense forests in dim sunlight. ""But I don't think we can assume that T. rex lacked feathers just because some fossil skeletons have skin impressions that are scaly,"" he added.  ""It takes inconceivable good luck to preserve feathers in fossils. Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they weren't there. So I don't think we need to throw out the image of a big fluffy T. rex quite yet."" The Tyrannosaurs were fearsome predators during the last part of the Cretaceous, 85 to 65 million years ago.  They were known for their sharp teeth, small beady eyes and tiny forelimbs (arms).  The group included Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus, as well as the iconic T. rex.

"Canada to change sex assault consent laws Canada has announced it is amending its sexual assault laws to clarify what consent means and better protect victims in court. The proposed changes were announced on Tuesday by Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. The law would clarify that someone cannot consent while unconscious, and expands ""rape shield laws"". Many of the proposed changes had already been introduced by the courts, but had yet to be written into law. ""I am hopeful that the proposed changes to the sexual assault provisions will go a long way towards ensuring that complainants are treated with the compassion, dignity and respect they deserve,"" said Ms Wilson-Raybould in a statement.  The proposed laws were introduced as part of Bill C-51, which would also require the minister of justice to table a statement for each new government bill on how the bill would affect Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The bill is expected to pass given the Liberals have a majority in Parliament. In 1992, Canada introduced ""rape shield laws"" that ban a complainant's sexual history or medical records from being used as evidence that she was likely to have consented to sex or that she was unreliable. The changes proposed on Tuesday would expand these laws to include sexual texts, emails, pictures and videos.  Similarly, in 2011 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that someone cannot consent to sex while unconscious. But this provision had not been written into the Criminal Code, and advocates say more clarity is needed. The law would also specify that a complainant has the right to an attorney when the courts are deciding whether a complainant's sexual history is admissible or not.

"Brazil judges delay vote which could topple president Brazil's Superior Electoral Court has deliberated but delayed voting on a case which could topple the country's President, Michel Temer.  The court, tasked with overseeing the electoral process, is looking at whether the 2014 elections were won using illegal campaign donations.  These were the elections that Dilma Rousseff won, with Mr Temer as her running mate. Ms Rousseff has since been impeached and replaced by Mr Temer. She was accused of illegally moving funds between government budgets. As a result, Mr Temer took over as Brazil's president in August 2016. However, this case - which was paused in April - could render the entire result from 2014 invalid, meaning he too could be removed from office. Seven judges are overseeing the case. Their hearing on Wednesday was marked by clashes between the rapporteur of the case and the president of the court, but no vote was held. Instead, more sessions have been scheduled to take place over the next three days.  If the judges rule that the election campaign was indeed illegally financed, then the elections could be annulled and Mr Temer will be out of a job.  But that is the most straightforward scenario, BBC South America correspondent Katy Watson writes. Experts warn it probably will not be so simple.  They could implicate the entire Rousseff-Temer ticket or implicate just Ms Rousseff. And even if Mr Temer is implicated and out of a job, he could appeal or the judges could ask for more time to consider the case.  It seems the only thing that is certain is that there is unlikely to be much more clarity by the end of the week.  In the first of the four court sessions, the prosecution set out its case and defence lawyers responded. Mr Temer did not appear and local media report that he cancelled an official event to watch the court session on TV in the presidential palace. His lawyer said Mr Temer should not have to pay the price for the history of corruption in Brazil but the prosecution argued that there had been a clear abuse of economic power. The judges did not cast any votes. Riot police lined up outside the Superior Electoral Court but only a small number of protesters were there. The case comes at an especially difficult time for Brazilian politics, which has been in a state of crisis for a while now.  Since March 2014, the country's largest-ever corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, has implicated some of Brazil's biggest names. A third of the cabinet are under investigation for corruption.  Then last month, leaked audio recordings surfaced that seemed to show the president encouraging the payment of hush money to Eduardo Cunha, the former lower house speaker who led the impeachment process against Ms Rousseff.  At first sight, this case taking place in Brasilia seems unconnected to the latest uproar because it started before the audio recordings surfaced. But it is all dirty politics, say experts.  ""I think they're part of the same phenomenon,"" says Ivar Hartmann, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation Law school in Rio de Janeiro. Referring to Michel Temer trying to keep Eduardo Cunha quiet, he says: ""That's part of the same type of corruption that was used in the 2014 campaign so they're all related."" And the allegations against Mr Temer are so serious that they are expected to play a part in any ruling.  ""There's a big political element to it, a political calculus to it,"" says Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, the Latin America director at the Eurasia Group.  ""Even though the case does not specifically deal with the recording of two weeks ago, that recording does provide a backdrop, a context in which judges will make a decision."" Even before the recordings surfaced, Mr Temer had approval ratings in the single digits. But among the political and business elite he was tolerated, partly because he was trying to push through pension reforms aimed at reshaping and improving Brazil's ailing economy.  But despite the country exiting its longest-ever recession last week, his future still hangs in the balance.  ""We thought before that as long as Temer was being seen as the answer to the political crisis, and by keeping the reform momentum going in Congress, things were starting to improve,"" says Mr de Castro Neves.  ""We thought that that would make judges at the Electoral Court a little bit more risk-averse, meaning if they take Temer out, the cost of removing Temer is too high, basically plunging the country back into instability.""  But that calculation is shifting day by day with the drip-drip of new leaks, allegations and arrests.  Whether or not the judges come to a decision at the end of this week, Mr Temer's role may be untenable if uncertainty continues and he loses political support. But if Mr Temer is pushed out of office, there will be the added complication of who replaces him and how.  According to the Brazilian constitution, if there are fewer than two years left in a term, Congress will choose a caretaker president to govern until the 2018 elections.  But nobody really knows the rules of this kind of election because it has never happened before.  People here are fed up. They say they did not elect Mr Temer in the 2014 election.  They want direct elections so they can choose a new leader rather than have it chosen by a Congress that is seen as part of the problem.

"Paris's Notre-Dame: Attacker shot outside cathedral Police have shot a man who attacked an officer with a hammer outside the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris. The man shouted ""this is for Syria"" during the attack, the interior minister said. Prosecutors have opened a terrorism investigation. The officer suffered minor injuries. The suspect was wounded in the chest when another policeman opened fire. Tourists fled for cover as the attack unfolded. Hundreds of people were in the cathedral at the time. France is in a state of emergency since attacks by jihadists in Paris killed 130 people in 2015. It is part of the US-led international coalition against IS and has conducted air strikes against militants in Syria. The assailant on Tuesday afternoon carried kitchen knives and the identity card of an Algerian student, French Interior Minister Gérard Collomb said. The man, who was being treated in hospital, has not been named. The terrorist spotlight has swung to Britain, but no-one in France is under the illusion that the country is safe. Squads of soldiers with automatic weapons at the ready are a regular sight on the streets of Paris. France remains a favourite target for the propagandists of so-called Islamic State. What intrigues is the similar character of four recent attacks in Paris: at the Louvre in February, where a man attacked a soldier with a machete; at Orly airport in  March, where an attacker was killed after trying to take a gun from a soldier; on the Champs-Elysées last month, where a  gunman killed a policeman before himself being killed; and now this. Different from the recent UK atrocities - and the earlier French attacks in Paris and Nice - none of these recent French attacks was against random targets. They were all conducted by lone men. And they were all against clearly identified symbols of the state. As police declared the situation ""under control"", hundreds of people were being allowed to leave the cathedral. Kellyn Gorman, an American tourist, said: ""I was about to come inside [the cathedral] and heard the noise, the gunshots, turned around and saw the assailant on the ground where they had shot him.""

Bars across the US have opened early for the event, with some even serving special cocktails for the occasion. Two national security officials, NSA Director Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, a day earlier testified to senators that they never felt pressured by the White House to do anything illegal. But in Thursday's Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Mr Comey will detail how Mr Trump made him uncomfortable during a series of encounters leading up to the FBI director's firing on 9 May. It is one of several congressional panels that, along with the Justice Department, is investigating US intelligence assessments that Russian hackers meddled in last November's presidential election in an effort to help Mr Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The inquiries are also investigating whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the alleged Kremlin plot, which Moscow has repeatedly denied. Mr Comey will say his first meeting with the president occurred on 6 January in a conference room at Trump Tower, where Mr Comey briefed him alone on ""salacious and unverified"" allegations about him. A dossier compiled by a former British intelligence official had claimed the Russian security services possessed compromising material on Mr Trump, including that he had been recorded consorting with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel. Mr Comey will testify the president ""expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them"" during a subsequent meeting. That denial came in a one-to-one dinner on 27 January at the White House, Mr Comey will say, adding that he had a ""very awkward conversation"" with the president that evening. It's like a sneak preview of a blockbuster movie - this opening statement should be preceded with a ""Spoiler Alert!"" warning. Mr Comey is going to largely confirm all the reports that were circulating in the media about what took place during his private meetings with the president - the talk of loyalty, the pressure on the FBI to ease off its Flynn investigation, the multiple requests for public confirmation that the FBI was not targeting Mr Trump himself.  While Mr Comey casts the president in a less-than-flattering light, he does shy away from directly accusing the president of obstruction of justice. Much will be made of how the two men may have interpreted the phrase ""honest loyalty"" differently. In addition, Mr Comey viewed the president's Flynn request as only relating to his conversations with the Russian ambassador and not the investigation as a whole. That may not matter much, however. Large portions of the former director's account is in direct contradiction to Mr Trump's version of their meetings. It sets up a ""he-said, he-said"" situation - but Mr Comey has memos and conversations with other FBI officials to buttress his case.  What's more, if recent polls are any indication, the American public trusts him more than the president. Mr Comey's performance under questioning - particularly if Mr Trump responds angrily via Twitter - could further sour the public mood. Four takeaways from Comey's testimony Mr Trump asked the FBI director during the discussion in the Green Room whether he wanted to stay in his job, Mr Comey will say. He will explain he found this ""strange"" because Mr Trump had already told him twice in earlier conversations that he hoped he would not step down. The former FBI director will say the question ""concerned me greatly"" because he felt the dinner was an effort to ""create some sort of patronage relationship"".  The former FBI director will testify: ""A few moments later, the president said, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.'  ""I didn't move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence."" In testimony, the former FBI director will detail his next encounter with Mr Trump, during a meeting attended by intelligence chiefs at the White House on 14 February. The president asked Mr Comey to stay at the end of the Oval Office meeting and told him: ""I want to talk about Mike Flynn."" Mr Trump accepted Mr Flynn's resignation as national security adviser just 24 days into the job after he misled the White House about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Mr Comey will say Mr Trump told him: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy."" The former FBI director will testify that he offered no such assurance.  Mr Comey also will say the president phoned him on 30 March and said the Russia investigation was ""a cloud that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country"". The former FBI director will tell the Senate panel that Mr Trump ""said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia"". Mr Comey will say he assured Mr Trump during their discussions on 6 January, 27 January and 30 March that the president himself was not under investigation. He will say that Mr Trump told him during the 30 March phone call: ""We need to get that fact out."" The former FBI director will say Mr Trump phoned him again on 11 April to press him on this matter. It was the last time they spoke. Mr Comey also will testify he told the president the White House should contact the Department of Justice. The former FBI director notes that he spoke with President Barack Obama only twice during the more than three years that their time in office overlapped. But he can recall nine one-on-one conversations with Mr Trump in four months, three in person and six on the phone.",Thursday 08 June 2017,8-Jun-17,Comey to say Trump demanded his loyalty,"The ex-FBI chief will testify that Mr Trump called the Russian probe ""a cloud"" over his presidency.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40192255
"Tehran attackers 'were IS recruits from Iran' Iran says the attackers who killed 12 people in the capital Tehran were Iranians who had joined so-called Islamic State (IS). Suicide bombers attacked parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini. All the attackers were killed. Five people believed to be planning a third attack were arrested, officials said. Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards accused Saudi Arabia and the US of being behind the attacks. The violence comes amid heightened tension in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states cutting ties with Qatar over alleged support for Islamist militants and closer ties with Iran. Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shia-majority Iran are staunch regional rivals. In an interview on state TV, Reza Seifollahi, deputy chief of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said the attackers ""had joined Daesh [IS] from a number of regions inside Iran."" IS earlier claimed the attacks - a first for Iran - and threatened further assaults on Iranian Shia Muslims. Iran's Revolutionary Guards vowed revenge for the bloodshed, but pointed the finger at the US and Saudi Arabia in the wake of President Donald Trump's recent visit to the kingdom. ""This terrorist action, coming one week after the meeting of the president of the United States with the leader of the one of the region's reactionary governments (Saudi Arabia)... shows they are involved in this savage action,"" it said in a statement. The US and Saudi Arabia both condemned the attacks. US President Donald Trump said he was praying for the victims but added that ""states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote"". Claiming the attack, IS posted a video which showed what it claimed was footage from inside the parliament building. A voice is heard saying, in Arabic: ""We're not going anywhere. We're staying forever."" BBC Persian's Jenny Norton says that despite Iran's active involvement in fighting IS in both Iraq and Syria, the Sunni group has not until now carried out any attacks inside Iran, and appears to have little support in this predominantly Shia country.  However, our analyst says, in recent months the group has stepped up its Farsi-language propaganda efforts - targeting Iran's restive Sunni minority. Iranian intelligence agencies claim to have foiled a number of IS-inspired plots. But by mounting a successful attack, IS could claim a major coup against a traditional foe that other Sunni jihadist groups, including its rival al-Qaeda, have failed to target in the past. Middle East analyst Dina Esfandiary says one possible consequence will be increased calls by hardliners for tougher action against IS in Iraq and Syria. Public support for action in Iraq is likely to grow, as it did when IS took swathes of territory in the country in 2014. But Iran's involvement in Syria is not popular, our analyst says - it is seen as having few benefits and costing too many Iranian lives. The attacks will also boost the popularity of the Revolutionary Guards, seen as protectors of the nation.",Thursday 08 June 2017,8-Jun-17,Tehran attackers 'IS recruits from Iran',So-called Islamic State claims the attacks but Iran blames Saudi Arabia and the US.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40195172
"Taliban territory: Life in Afghanistan under the militants Sixteen years after they were ousted in the US-led invasion, the Taliban have fought their way back to control swathes of Afghanistan. The country remains mired in conflict, and recent months have seen a series of bloody attacks. In the south, key towns are now Taliban territory. The BBC's Auliya Atrafi was invited by the militants to spend four days behind the front line in Helmand province witnessing life under their control. In the town of Sangin, two dozen men sat cross-legged inside a huge mud compound. Under the full moon, their black turbans cast deep shadows over their sunburned features.   These were the Taliban's special forces; the Red Unit. They sat quietly as they listened to their commander Mullah Taqi telling war stories, gently cradling their M4 machine guns. The M4s, with their night-vision scopes, were one of the main reasons they had captured nearly 85% of Helmand province from less-well-armed Afghan forces. But these victories had presented Taliban leaders with an unexpected challenge.  The people they now ruled had lived with government services for more than a decade. Schools, hospitals, development - residents had become accustomed to them. So how could a group entirely focused on taking territory evolve into one that could attempt to run it? Setting up our visit to Taliban territory took months. It had been years since a journalist with international media had secured such access. But in mid-May, we crossed the frontline in Gereshk, following a boy on a motorbike. We drove on the main Kabul-Herat highway towards Kandahar.  Just by an Afghan National Army post, the boy suddenly turned left, leaving the highway behind, and rode into scattered settlements. He handed us over to two Taliban guards who were manning a makeshift base. One sat with us in the car, while the other led us on a motorbike towards the Zanbulai area.  There, waiting for us. was Mullah Taqi, the head of Taliban special forces. He stood with a group of his men, all nursing sophisticated weaponry.    Throughout the visit we were accompanied by a Taliban media team who controlled what we saw.  We were not allowed to film anything to do with opium.  The opium trade is synonymous with this region - Afghanistan produces about 90% of the world's opium - and helps fund the Taliban.  I tried to explain to their media head, Asad Afghan, the English concept of ""an elephant in the room"". He put his hand on my shoulder and said: ""Opium is our economic necessity, but we hate it as much as you do.""  The fact is the Taliban need the money they get from drugs - it buys arms and helps fund their fight. Our first encounter with Taliban governance came in the market. Sangin has been fiercely contested for more than a decade - hundreds of UK, US and Afghan troops lost their lives here - and finally fell to the Taliban in March this year.  The old Sangin bazaar had been flattened in the battle for the city. We walked through its makeshift replacement, a sea of tarpaulin and boxes. Two men were arguing by a food stall.  ""I can't read!"" shouted shopkeeper Haji Saifullah. ""How was I supposed to know the biscuits were out of date?"" He fidgeted with his turban, pushing it to one side nervously. The other man was the Taliban mayor of Sangin, Noor Mohammad. He ordered Haji Saifullah to be imprisoned for three days and to pay a fine.  Next on the mayor's list was inspecting petrol containers to see if they had been altered to pour under the promised gallon. After that came examinations for people who claimed to be doctors, but who he suspected were lying.  Later we drove to Musa Qala, the Taliban's de facto capital. Just short of the town, we stopped at a travelling bazaar set up on a dry riverbed.  Musa Qala is famous for the opium trade but it is also a commercial lifeline for the district. Traders come here all the way from the Afghan-Pakistan border areas. At the bazaar you could buy motorbikes, cows, ice-cream - and less conventional commodities such as ammunition.  Bullets for an AK47 were 25 cents (15p) each. Bullets for a Russian machine-gun used to be 40 cents each, but were reduced to 15 cents because - according to the shopkeeper - too many of them had been captured from the Afghan security forces. While the Taliban focus on health, safety and trading standards in Sangin was surprising, more discoveries awaited us in Musa Qala. Despite it being the Taliban capital, the school and hospital were still being funded by the government in Kabul.  Read more about the conflict: ""The government recently did their inspections; our schools were officially registered; our salaries that were locked for a year were later released,"" said Abdul Rahim, the government's head of education for Musa Qala. He said the Taliban did not have any problem with government inspectors, and that the system was working.  ""The government give us stationery and everything else, we implement the government syllabus and the Taliban don't have a problem with it,"" he said.  But not everything was running smoothly. Across Afghanistan, about 40% of pupils enrolled in schools are female, according to US Aid. Not in Musa Qala, however. No girls over the age of about 12 were being educated in the Taliban capital. But girls were deprived of education here even before the Taliban took hold, because it is a very conservative area.  For the boys, meanwhile, there were not enough basic supplies.  ""The way our school is run is good, as in security, but we have one problem and that's we don't have enough books,"" said one student, Dadul-Haq. ""One student will be missing maths, the other chemistry - not all pupils have the same books."" It struck me that in education, at least, the Taliban are tentatively experimenting by allowing wider access to education - at least for boys - than during their earlier regime. Under them, before 2001, many fewer boys went to school in the countryside. But experiences like Haji Saifullah's - the biscuit seller in Sangin - have made rural Afghans realise that education and literacy are essential. They will not turn you into an infidel, as their forefathers feared.  Now the Taliban appear to have realised that they cannot fight the modern world forever, so some have opted to join it on their own terms.  Asad Afghan, the Taliban's media co-ordinator, used a proverb to make his point. ""The fire may have burnt our house, but it made our walls stronger,"" he said. He meant that the Taliban had learned from the past mistake of isolating themselves from modernisation.  Many say the Taliban have brought some security - albeit with limited freedoms - to the countryside they control. Areas used to years of fighting between troops and militants are now seeing a dramatic rise in trade. Many people say they prefer the Taliban's swift - but flawed - system of justice to the previous administration, which they say was riddled with corruption and patronage. We visited the district hospital which, like the school, was funded by the government but run by the Taliban. It is meant to serve 120,000 people, but lacked many basic facilities. There was not one female doctor; neither was there a paediatric specialist. It wasn't even possible to get a chest X-ray.  To cater for women the Taliban had built a separate facility next door, run by female staff. One doctor said the dual system had created a responsibility vacuum and opened the door to corruption. ""I haven't been paid in the past six months - not only me but also the entire staff of the hospital,"" he said.  ""[Government] supervisors write things on paper that don't turn into reality. Our medicine for three months doesn't last us more than a month and half… this is because sometimes the Taliban come and want medicine for themselves."" We asked the Taliban's supervisor for health services, Attaullah, if we could interview a female nurse, but he refused.  Her husband told him that he had no problem with the interview, but Attaullah said: ""It is your right to allow the interview and my responsibility to stop it.  ""What would be the difference between us and the government if we allowed interviews with women?"" During the four days I was in Taliban territory, I only saw women in clinics and being transported around by their male relatives. But men here have always preferred women to stay at home out of sight. Even if the Taliban were not here, it is unlikely things would be very different.      Some activities were limited. In Musa Qala, using mobile phones and the internet was banned for security and religious reasons - our Taliban media handlers communicated via walkie-talkies. Filming and playing musical instruments are also not allowed. One young man told me he was given 40 lashes for watching a Bollywood film.  The Taliban have cracked down on bachabaze - dance parties involving teenage boys that can often end in sexual abuse. They also come down hard on homosexuality, although it appears the Taliban legal process can be influenced with a mixture of pulling strings and bribes.   There are contradictions. We were allowed in to film, for example. And we passed billboards that featured pictures of Western women advertising dental clinics - a far cry from the days when the Taliban banned such images. Despite the internet ban, there are wi-fi hotspots providing a connection to the outside world. A few dedicated fans of Turkish and Indian soap operas have televisions connected to small satellite dishes. ""Aren't you scared the Taliban will find out?"" I asked one teenager. ""They know about our TV and the wi-fi,"" he said. ""But I think they are just watching and waiting, to see what happens."" During our visit, we were aware that the Taliban were treating us carefully, mindful of creating a good impression. Equally, Sangin and Musa Qala are important to them, so keeping local people happy matters. We heard reports that Taliban control in other places was more rigid.  For the Taliban, beginning to adapt in the face of modernity seems to be a painful dilemma: embrace it and you lose control and religious legitimacy; reject it and you become an island.  When it comes to governance, the Taliban's Achilles heel is thought to be their political philosophy, or rather the lack of it. From the start, their focus has been on war and there has been little scope for political thinking to evolve. Their success has become their greatest nemesis.  As a white-bearded school headmaster put it: ""The Taliban see everything through the prism of war, and they see winning wars as their sole purpose in life.""   I reminded him that the Taliban also had a culture of obedience and were disciplined, so didn't he think they would be able to direct their devotion to war into the art of politics? He dropped his head, thought for a moment and shook his head doubtfully. He didn't think so. At night, we would dine with local Taliban leaders and discuss these themes.   One evening a Taliban leader strove to convince us of the benefits of life under the Taliban by contrasting it with the failings of the Afghan government. But it struck me that the world they wanted to create was too absolute for a human society.   I suggested that society was messy, complicated and always in transition, and wondered how successful any government would be trying put it in a fixed framework. The leader, Musavir Sahib, was a tiny man, with long beard and blue eyes. He was adamant: ""Our governance is based on sacred scripture; it is the best solution for any human society. ""Afghans are adaptable people,"" he added. ""When we took over the country for the first time, very soon people started dressing up like us. And then when the Americans came, they started dressing up like the Americans. So surely they will adopt our governance again."" He could not conceive that people could oppose Taliban rule and were coerced by them into doing what they wanted.  Back inside government-held territory, I realised that describing the insurgent group had become less straightforward and full of contradictions. The Taliban have changed significantly while at the same time they are stuck in their past; they feel they have to adapt to the modern world while thinking theirs is the best way of governance.  In the areas they hold, they seem to be trying to provide a peaceful existence, but elsewhere they continue carrying out their deadly bombings. Their goal to create their specific kind of extreme Islamic state is unchanged and they are still fighting because they see themselves as winning. But they now face a new challenge. In the areas they control, people now expect life-changing improvements like healthcare and electricity - a lasting legacy of the billions of dollars that poured in with foreign forces to rebuild Afghanistan in the years after 9/11. How will the Taliban cope with that shift?

"North Korea fires anti-ship missiles, says South Korea North Korea has fired several anti-ship cruise missiles off its east coast, South Korea's military says. Authorities said the weapons, launched on Thursday morning near the city of Wonsan, appeared to be short-range ""surface-to-ship"" missiles.  They flew about 200km (125 miles) before landing in the water.    Repeated ballistic missile tests by the North this year - not all successful but all a breach of UN sanctions - have sparked international alarm. Experts fear the tests indicate progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile. It is unclear whether the latest firing violates the UN Security Council's resolutions against North Korea.  The resolution issued on 2 June specifically bans Pyongyang from nuclear activity and ballistic missiles, but also bans launches of ""any other provocation"" and ""any other existing weapons of mass destruction"". South Korean military spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said the latest launch showed the North ""likely wanted to show off its ability to precisely target a large warship"" after recent military drills involving US aircraft carriers and South Korean troops. ""By testing different types of missiles, North Korea also appears to be aiming to secure the upper hand in relations with South Korea and the United States,"" he told reporters. Anti-ship cruise missiles are guided missiles which generally skim the water. In 2012, North Korea displayed several such weapons known as Styx. But North Korea has also previously unsuccessfully tested anti-ship ballistic missiles, experts believe. On 29 May, it fired a Scud-type ballistic missile from the same location, which flew about 450km. Last Friday the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a new resolution to impose targeted sanctions on certain North Korean officials and state entities. The US has also ramped up its military presence in the region, conducting drills with Japan as well as South Korea, and is installing a controversial missile defence system in South Korea, known as Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad).  But South Korea said on Wednesday it was suspending the further deployment of the system until an environmental assessment is completed.",Thursday 08 June 2017,8-Jun-17,North Korea fires 'anti-ship' missiles,"It happened off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, according to South Korea's military.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40196925
"Japanese fugitive on the run for 45 years is arrested For one suspected murderer in Japan, it has been a case of being able to run but not being able to hide. Left-wing revolutionary Masaaki Osaka has been arrested and charged for murdering a police officer during Tokyo street protests more than 45 years ago. He allegedly set the officer on fire using a Molotov Cocktail petrol bomb.  No other suspected criminal has spent longer evading arrest, Japanese media report. The country has no statute of limitations for murder. The 15-year time limit was abolished in 2010. Where do prison escapees and absconders actually go? Mr Osaka was arrested last month in a Hiroshima apartment belonging to the Chukaku-ha, or the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (JRCL). He is reported by police to have remained silent since being caught. The fugitive was initially accused of a separate offence - obstructing the police - before officers claim to have realised who he was. On Wednesday, he was transported from Hiroshima to Tokyo for further questioning, local media reported. Police say they have confirmed his identity through DNA tests because fingerprints were unavailable at the time of the crime.  They say Mr Osaka was able to remain on the run for so long because he is a former high-ranking member of the radical left-wing JRCL and was assisted by sympathetic party associates.  The JRCL was established in the late 1950s and during the 1960s and 1970s earned a reputation for staging violent street protests. Mr Osaka is accused of killing the 21-year-old police officer during a left wing riot in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward in 1971. He is alleged to have assaulted him with a steel pipe before setting him alight. The JRCL was protesting - among other things - against the recognition by Japan of the US military presence in the country. The man alleged to be Mr Osaka's accomplice in the 1971 attack was charged in 1972, but his case was suspended because of mental illness.

"US intelligence chief 'never felt pressured' by Trump The US director of national intelligence has said he ""never felt pressured"" to influence the inquiry into Russia's political meddling.  Dan Coats also told a Senate panel he did not think it was ""appropriate"" to discuss his conversations with the president at a public hearing. His comments follow a report that President Donald Trump asked him to derail the Russia investigation.  The National Security Agency chief also declined to comment on the matter.  Admiral Mike Rogers told a Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday he has never ""been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate"" as NSA director.  Mr Coats echoed Mr Rogers' statements as senators pressed the pair on their interactions with the president.  ""I'm willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don't know,"" he said. ""What I'm not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing,"" Mr Coats told the panel.  He is later appearing in a closed session before the committee on Wednesday afternoon.  This Senate testimony by intelligence community heads was billed as the undercard to James Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Top intelligence officials in the US government have taken a bunker mentality when it comes to the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, refusing to share details of presidential conversations in open Senate testimony. Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked. That may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration. The president and his aides shouldn't breathe easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses.  His former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight.   Mr Coats's testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as ""fake news"". The two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday.  The lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry. Republican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony.  ""At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer,"" he said.  The following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. He will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked. Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president.  The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times.

"Asian nations make plastic oceans promise Nations responsible for much of the world's ocean plastic pollution have promised to start cleaning up their act. At a UN oceans summit, delegates from China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines said they would work to keep plastics out of the seas. Some of the promises are not yet formalised and environmentalists say the measures proposed are not nearly urgent enough. But UN officials praised the statement.  Meeting in New York, they said it was part of a clear international shift against ocean pollution. Eric Solheim, the UN's environment director, told BBC News: ""There are quite encouraging signs, with nations taking the ocean much more seriously. Of course, there is a very long way to go because the problems are huge.""  It is estimated that 5-13 million tonnes of plastics flow into the world's oceans annually. Much of it is ingested by birds and fish – and fragments of plastic have even been found in organisms at the bottom of the ocean. A recent paper said much of the marine plastic often originates far from the sea – especially in countries which have developed consumer economies faster than their ability to manage waste. The  Helmholtz Centre in Leipzig, Germany, estimated that 75% of land-borne marine pollution comes from just 10 rivers, predominantly in Asia. Reducing the plastic loads in these rivers by 50% would reduce global plastic inputs by 37%, it said. Tom Dillon from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which campaign on oceans, urged China to move quickly. He told BBC News: ""For thousands of years the Maritime Silk Road was a pathway for export of Chinese culture and influence. Will the ocean be a vehicle for export of Chinese pollution, or a new culture of conservation and sustainability?"" A report to the UN conference from the Thailand government says most marine plastic debris is land-based, caused by inefficient waste management and poor handling of plastic wastes. In Thailand, the total amount of garbage finding its way into the sea was estimated at 2.83 million tonnes in 2016 - of which 12% was plastic. The Thai government says the nation has established a 20-year strategy to tackle the problem, including developing financial incentives for keeping plastic out of the sea and encouraging eco-packaging design and eco-friendly substitutes for plastics. In Indonesia, the government is starting a mass education programme for schoolchildren, and in the Philippines new laws are being developed. Part of the challenge is finding substitutes for plastics. An international prize for smarter materials and design for packaging was launched recently by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

"Uber 'obtained rape victim's medical records' An Uber executive obtained the medical records of a woman who said she was raped by a driver of the taxi-app firm in India, according to a report. Eric Alexander, who ran Uber's business in Asia, is said to have shared the records with the company's chief executive, Travis Kalanick, over a year ago. Uber confirmed to the BBC that Mr Alexander no longer worked at the firm - but offered no further comment. Technology news site Recode said Mr Alexander was fired only after the publication contacted the company about the story. It said as well as Mr Kalanick, the records were seen by the company's senior vice president, Emil Michael. Recode's report detailed how Uber was reportedly considering the prospect that the rape claim was concocted by rival Indian ride-sharing company, Ola, as part of a smear campaign. On Thursday, Ola told the BBC's Shilpa Kannan the allegations were ""despicable"". ""It is a shame that the privacy and morals of a woman have to be questioned in an attempt to trivialise a horrific crime,"" a spokesman for Ola said in an email.  ""It is despicable that anyone can even conceive an attempt to malign competition using this as an opportunity. If this report were to be even remotely true, this is an all time low on morality and a reflection of the very character of an organisation."" The news is the latest in a series of high-profile scandals greatly affecting Uber's reputation. On Tuesday, the company announced it had fired 20 employees as part of an investigation into sexual harassment and other misconduct at the company.  In December 2014, a 26-year-old Delhi woman was raped by Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav. Yadav was sentenced to life in prison. At the time Uber said ""sexual assault is a terrible crime and we're pleased he has now been brought to justice"", adding it had improved security due to ""lessons we learned from this awful case"". But the ride-sharing service was consequently banned from operating in Delhi (the ban was lifted in June 2015).  Behind the scenes, Uber executives reportedly doubted the authenticity of the woman's claim, and questioned whether Ola, an Uber competitor in India, was behind the incident as part of a sabotage attempt. As well as the criminal case, the woman sued Uber. It was settled out of court. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 ",Thursday 08 June 2017,8-Jun-17,Uber 'obtained rape victim's records',An Uber executive is fired after it is reported he obtained a rape victim’s medical records.,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40196055
"London attack: Family pays tribute to 'beautiful daughter' The family of London attack victim Sara Zelenak have paid tribute to their ""beautiful daughter and sister,"" as police say the death toll from Saturday's attacks has risen to eight. Relatives of the 21-year-old Australian, an au pair, said they were ""deeply saddened at the tragic loss"". All of those who died have now been named.  Earlier, police searching for French national Xavier Thomas, 45, said they had recovered a body from the Thames. Scotland Yard said the body was pulled from the river near Limehouse at 19:44 BST on Tuesday. Mr Thomas's next of kin have been told, police said, but formal identification has not yet taken place. Meanwhile, the prime minister of Spain said Ignacio Echeverría, 39, who died defending a woman with his skateboard, should be given a posthumous award - the Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit. Mr Echeverría was from Madrid and was working for HSBC bank in London. Another victim was named as Sebastien Belanger, from France.  Mr Belanger worked at the Coq d'Argent near Bank. He had been watching the Champions League final football match with friends at a nearby pub before the attack. The others killed in the attack have been named as Australian Kirsty Boden, Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, from Hackney, London, and French national Alexandre Pigeard. NHS England said 29 patients remain in London hospitals, with 10 in a critical condition. Police have named Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian man who lived in east London, Khuram Butt, 27, from Barking, and Rachid Redouane, 30, who also lived in Barking, as the men who carried out the attack. They drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market. Redouane's ex-wife, Charisse O'Leary, said she was ""deeply shocked, saddened and numbed"" by his actions. ""My thoughts and efforts now are with trying to bring up my daughter with the knowledge that, someday, I will have to try and explain to her why her father did what he did."" Speaking at her house in Bologna, Italy, Zaghba's mother told the BBC she believed her son was radicalised in the UK. She said he was under surveillance when he was in Italy and questioned why this was not the case in the UK. An Italian police source confirmed to the BBC that Zaghba had been placed on a watch list, which is shared with many countries, including the UK. In March 2016, Italian officers stopped Zaghba at Bologna airport and found IS-related materials on his mobile phone. He was then stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. The BBC understands he was not prosecuted but was listed on the Schengen Information System, an EU-wide database which includes details of potential suspects. When Zaghba entered Britain, staff at passport control should automatically have been alerted by the Schengen system, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. ""One unconfirmed report suggests that did happen, apparently when Zaghba arrived at Stansted Airport in January - but that border staff still let him in,"" he said.

"Uber 'obtained rape victim's medical records' An Uber executive obtained the medical records of a woman who said she was raped by a driver of the taxi-app firm in India, according to a report. Eric Alexander, who ran Uber's business in Asia, is said to have shared the records with the company's chief executive, Travis Kalanick, over a year ago. Uber confirmed to the BBC that Mr Alexander no longer worked at the firm - but offered no further comment. Technology news site Recode said Mr Alexander was fired only after the publication contacted the company about the story. It said as well as Mr Kalanick, the records were seen by the company's senior vice president, Emil Michael. Recode's report detailed how Uber was reportedly considering the prospect that the rape claim was concocted by rival Indian ride-sharing company, Ola, as part of a smear campaign. On Thursday, Ola told the BBC's Shilpa Kannan the allegations were ""despicable"". ""It is a shame that the privacy and morals of a woman have to be questioned in an attempt to trivialise a horrific crime,"" a spokesman for Ola said in an email.  ""It is despicable that anyone can even conceive an attempt to malign competition using this as an opportunity.

"Mozambique police warn bald men after ritual attack Bald men in Mozambique could be targets of ritual attacks, police have warned, after the recent killing of five men for their body parts.  Two suspects have been arrested in the central district of Milange, where the killings occurred. ""The belief is that the head of a bald man contains gold,"" said Afonso Dias, a police commander in Mozambique's central Zambezia province. Albino people have also been killed in the region for ritual purposes. Three men have been killed in the past week alone. The BBC's Jose Tembe in the capital, Maputo, says police think the notion of a bald head containing gold is a ruse by witchdoctors to get clients to take a person's head to them. ""Their motive comes from superstition and culture - the local community thinks bald individuals are rich,"" Commander Dias is reported as having told a press conference in Maputo. The suspects are two young Mozambicans aged around 20, the AFP news agency reports. A regional security spokesman, Miguel Caetano, told AFP that one of the victims had his head cut off and his organs removed.  The organs were to be used in rituals to advance the wealth of clients in Tanzania and Malawi, Mr Caetano said, citing the suspects. There has been a spate of killings of people with albinism in East Africa in recent years, with their body parts used to make charms and potions by witchdoctors.",Thursday 08 June 2017,8-Jun-17,Police warn bald men after ritual attack,Some people in Mozambique believe that the heads of bald men contain gold.,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40185359
"Burmese military plane vanishes over Andaman Sea Hopes are fading for the 120 people on board a Burmese military plane which has gone missing over the Andaman Sea. The army said the plane was flying between the southern city of Myeik and Yangon (Rangoon). Search and rescue efforts are under way. ""Communication was lost suddenly at about 1:35 pm [07:05 GMT] when it reached about 20 miles west of Dawei town,"" the army said in a statement. There were 106 military personnel and family members and 14 crew on board. The plane, a Y8 transporter made in China, was half an hour into the short routine flight. Latest reports suggest that debris has been spotted in the sea by some of the military planes or ships dispatched to the area. There were no reports of bad weather at that time. The plane was purchased from China in March last year and had logged 809 flying hours, the army said. Myanmar has seen a number of aircraft incidents in recent years.  In February 2016, the five-member crew of an air force plane died when the aircraft crashed in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw. A few months later, three officers were killed when a military helicopter crashed in central Myanmar.
